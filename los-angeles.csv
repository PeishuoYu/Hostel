Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,beautiful hostel and friendly staff.
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,first stay at a hostel and i couldn't have enjoyed it more!
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i would definitely state again when i come back to downtown los angeles. it was perfect for someone who is just visiting a weekend and needs to place crash. the rooftop pool was amazing and relaxing. overall, the place was beautiful and the folks staying there were also really nice. "
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"this place looks good on the website, then you get there and it's even better.  imagine if soho house did hostels, this is what you'd get.  it's essentially a really nice hotel, which happens to also have dorm rooms.  staff were really friendly and i met some great people there.  the rooftop pool is lovely to!  rooms are very comfortable with great bathrooms as well.  not sure i'm ever gonna find another hostel that'll match up to this one!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing stay! i didn't want to leave.    free breakfast in the lounge was a bit underwhelming, but am i even allowed to complain about a free breakfast? especially when the rest of the facilities are absolutely killer... i can't wait to come back.    xoxox"
Canada,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"amazing hostel, the rooftop bar is as stunning a place to hangout as you could ever ask for! drinks are pricey for a hostel, but it’s l.a. so that’s to be expected. rooms were very clean and well maintained, bed is large enough for anyone up to about 6’4 or 195cm. not the most social hostel, most people tend to stick to themselves, but altogether, amazing value and a sense of luxury that is rarely felt when staying at a hostel. i will definitely return and would recommend anyone to stay here. "
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,6,10,6,4,"freehand la was a very fancy hostel (more like hotel), but there were just a few things that did not make it my all-time favorite hostel. the check-in process took awhile, due to a technical issue on their end. definitely an older adult vibe. was told it was happy hour at bar, but when ordering drinks told there was no happy hour that night (weird). very pricey bar!  a bed in our room was not clean &amp; seemed someone recently slept there, which makes me wonder how clean the rooms actually are....."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"awesome venue. staff were very friendly and helpful. the accomodation was all modern, private and very comfortable. overall was far better than what i expected. the bar upstairs has a cool vibe and is an awesome place to socialise. would stay there again."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,by far and away he best hostel i've stayed in - totally worth the extra cost. also thought the atmosphere and mix of people was a lot of fun. will definitely stay here next time i'm in la!
India,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"warm and welcoming staff, brunch is very good, beautiful property and very well connected to downtown la. highly recommended!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"(pros) has separate bathrooms for each room, nice big lockers, badass receptions (cons) shower head is weak, water taste funny, surplus for taxes and safety deposit is a bit high. "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is the best hostels out there, it’s more like a hotel type, but you only pay hostel price. i like it awesome. you can’t go wrong. true voice from heart. "
England,Couple,18-24,5.1,2,8,4,8,2,6,6,staff specially downstairs bar staff are bitchy and rude. don’t work in hospitality if you’re gonna have attitude. you won’t get deposit back into account either. however! food and rooms are decent and while i have complaints against most staff there are decent people! just too clicky etc. not for people who aren’t into popularity contests or social clicks! but that is l.a. for you 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,fantastic hostel definitely y=the best in la
Indonesia,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,6,10,"overall this is a very good hotel, locqtion is near everything and the room is very fancy and more like a hotel setup vs a hostel setup    since this were more like a hotel, there arent many chances that people would be able to interact between fellow traveller"
Canada,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent hostel. one of the best i've ever stayed around the world. will definitely stay again next time i'm back to la.
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing place. more of a hotel than a hostel, great service, super awesome rooftop pool with strong wifi signal everywhere. i was in town working remotely and had no issues connecting, making calls, etc. pool side. it was a wonderful stay! quiet rooms, super clean, lively hotel lobby. will definitely stay again!"
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of my favorite hostels so far.. sooo nice and clean, beautiful place with awesome pool and bar.. a bit more pricier then most hostels but def worth it!"
Austria,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"this place is just beautiful.! the dorm was small, but cosy and the genius design of the beds , and layout of the room gave more privacy than usual in a dorm and made the room appear much bigger than it was.  at night, it was quiet.  staff was super friendly and helpful and the rooftop-terarce is  just beautiful.  the inner city location was great for getting around. i am not sure whether i would feel safe walking around there late at night (but that is always hard to judge in anohter city)  "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was amazing! very clean, staff are friendly and great ambiance! there is a very nice roof top bar/pool and a very nice israelan restaurant at the exchange. i would go back anytime. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,we only stayed here one night. we wished we had been able to stay a few more days. it was a great location. this was my first time staying in a hostel in the states. it was very clean and safe. the staff was very helpful. when we called to ask about parking we were told the valet was the best option for $44 and we may be able to find something for $30. however we found a place right down the street for $12. 
Canada,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"excellent clean hostel with solid wooden bunk beds with minimal shaking.  every bunk has an light, electrical outlet, a curtain for privacy and a shelf that can hold a lot of personal items.  rooms also have their own bathrooms opposite of having to go outside.  every bed also has a dedicated locker for valuables.    location was perfect for me as i was in town to attend a kings' game at staples center, the hostel is located a 15 min walk from the arena."
Namibia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved everything about freehand. louis (i could have his name spelled wrong) checked me in even though i got there about 2hours before check in time. he also recommended activities for me to check out. lovely place!
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,6,10,8,10,10,4,10,"more like a hotel than a hostel, not great for solo travelers who want to find people to chat to. but the rooftop pool and bar make a great place to chill out. "
Ireland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"first class hostel, the whole stay with rooftop bar and pool was truly a hostel experience that i never had before. very near the metro station so you can base yourself there and tour the other areas of la at ease retuning to these amazing surroundings at night to relax. "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a wonderful time at this location. staff was friendly and cool, the facilities were good, the place is super clean, and the aesthetics of the place was amazing."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,8,10,10,2,8,4,4,no laundry although the website said there was. kitchen was small and common areas were public to everyone. the lounge was more of a dining hall style. could not take your own food and eat at the rooftop which was disappointing.  room was good although there was no bin in room or good storage for big suitcases (especially when there was 4 big suitcases in the room at one time).
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,really nice hostel.   highly recommend it.     only issue was the shower didn't drain well so there was a pool of water you stood in while showering.     otherwise a really nice hostel (better than the motel i stayed at and paid significantly more for during the rest of my trip)
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"really great hotel! stayed in a mixed bed dorm; beds were comfy and you had your own locker and charging points at each bed. free wifi was very handy, breakfast was good and is a 5 minute walk to the train station. staff were friendly and very helpful, would stay here again for sure!"
Canada,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"great overall stay! this place is pretty much a hotel the entire hostel is one of the nicest i have seen for its price. affordable and really good amenities. rooftop patio is amazing, especially during the night when its converted to a social gathering space. my only small complaint would be that the breakfast area is small so it may be tough to find seating. also the location is in downtown la so it's a bit travel if you want to go to venice beach. i would definitely recommend this place."
Kuwait,Male,25-30,5.7,2,8,4,8,6,2,10,the rest room didn’t have a lock 4 a reason  it’s overpriced compare in what i had in sfo
BosniaAndHerzegovina,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location and great price.    be careful about the parking, there are some places very close with good prices and some places where you have to pay 40usd+ for a night!"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"besides getting double charge which was a computer error, the staff worked with me on that. friendly staff and nice and clean. "
England,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,10,8,8,10,"this is a great hostel. the dorms are on one of the floors of the hotel which benefits from a rooftop pool and bar.   both the bars on the ground floor and rooftop were well stocked and had a hipster chic vibe to them. with no real space to socialise it's not the best option for a solo traveller - it definitely feels more of a hotel than hostel especially as my room was empty on my last day.   that said for the price and he overall vibe it's well worth a go, especially in a group! "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed at freehand for one night &amp; it was easily the best hostel i've ever stayed in. great location as it's within walking distance or quick uber to everything, sites and local stores which made it really convenient. my four bed female dorm was extremely comfortable and very clean, with a spacious private bathroom. the complimentary breakfast was great, so were the bars and restaurants in house - the rooftop was my favourite! staff were very friendly &amp; so helpful. highly recommend!"
NewZealand,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing stay at freehand los angeles! the atmosphere here is great and everyone is really lovely! free breakfast and an awesome rooftop pool are definitely a plus! would recommend this stay to anyone looking for a central hostel in la that makes you feel at home. couldn’t have asked for a better stay, loved it. :-)"
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i stayed at freehand while i was at a conference in la. this is an awesome place to stay! the facilities were clean, staff professional and friendly, and the environment fun, yet safe. i chose an all female room. on my last night, there was a mistake with a male being assigned the room, but the staff quickly reassigned rooms after bringing this to their attention. the rooftop bar and pool are really cool. it should be noted though that the music is loud, so be prepared with earplugs! "
Ukraine,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"freehand la is the best hostel/hotel i've ever stayed in. great interior design &amp; materials (linens, beds etc) to the level that you won't get from many good hotels. amazing service. and of course it's very clean, safe and well located. i wouldn't stay anywhere else in la."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing experience. can't wait to stay again, the pool on the roof is a highlight!"
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clearly the best hostel i've ever been to! it's even better than most of the hotels i've visited. i would definitely come again! the only thing i didn't really like was the breakfast, but it's included and so it's totally okay not to have lots of different choices for what to eat in the morning."
Canada,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"very helpful staff, very clean and new. kitchen could use take-away cups for coffee :-)"
Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"for 4 days, probably the best hostel i have ever stayed at. the staff were amazing, the rooms were clean and the location was central to everything. i would definitely recommend this hostel to anyone who is going to la."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was one of the best hostels i have stayed in. great location and fantastic rooms. would highly recommend. 
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the freehand has the backpacking game down! i had such a great time! the staff was engaging, funny, and as excited as we were to be there. i hope i get the chance to stay there again!    p.s. i'm also super tall and the beds were more than spacious, something i'm not accustomed to in even the highest rated hostels. +++"
England,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,"a fairly decent spot - in a trendy area and enjoyed the swimming pool. however, the staff weren't always around and the rooms themselves were fairly small in size. plus the food and drinks were more expensive than their peers."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"freehand is a really nice place to stay! the beds are outfitted with little nooks to store your bedside needs plus a charging port, which is super clutch. the overall vibe of the place is incredibly styled and elevated. it felt like i was living in an instagram post! i'm disappointed i didn't get to stay longer to try out their rooftop pool/bar, but if i come back to la, i'll definitely be looking to stay here again!"
China,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful place in the heart of downtown la, the rooftop bar and pool has wonderful view!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,the hotel has a great envirnment and good facilities. it’s clean and it safe. it’s in downtown la which there is a lot of things to do as well and close to everything.
Australia,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,make sure you check out the rooftop bar and pool!!!
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,6,10,10,10,8,"beautiful space, i love 1920's architecture so i was excited to see this reno! the staff was friendly and helpful. restaurant is great. coffee was a bit overpriced and there are several great shops close by with a lower price and better pastry selection but it sure was convenient for the last day before heading to the airport. lots of plants which is always awesome. it was very quiet in the rooms, although my bed never got made and the trash wasn't emptied every day. clean overall though. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,the location was perfect. the room was really nice but a bit dark. the top bed was a bit hard to get into but very comfortable. 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,ok this was my very first time staying in a hostel and the freehand far exceeded my expectations. everything from the decor to the rooms to the staff were excellent. i will definitely stay here during my next visit to la a great location as well absolutely loved this place!
Serbia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was my first time to stay in hostel and i had an amazing experience!room was clean,staff was really nice and friendly, location is great, subway station is really close and few nice places to eat too. atmosphere was welcoming and friendly and you can meet some cool people by staying in this hostel."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,so nice pool on the roof over looking. downtown la staff great location great whole foods great bed great shower great everything is so great no words to describe just come and you will seeand then you will. oh my god i mean it
Philippines,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a bit over my budget but you get what you paid for. beautiful place. excellent service. great location. 
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,great place to hang out and lodge but bartenders’ customer service is a thumbsdown. 
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's the fanciest hostel i've ever been to. it's hotel-hostel hybrid, very new and clean. i stayed in a 6-bed mix room, which has its own bathroom, and it is spacious. the breakfast is just so so, but overall, it's worth it. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were super nice, from the moment you get there until you leave. the pictures on the website are accurate, i think its much nicer in person. and the people who bunked with me were very respectful and interesting. there was a sense of privacy and regard from other roommates. i would visit again."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hands down the best hostel i've stayed at. super luxurious, decor and aesthetics on point. immaculate bathrooms and rooms. each bed has their own reading light and feels super private. they include a towel in the bed price, which is awesome. will def stay there again."
CzechRepublic,Female,31-40,7.4,8,6,10,6,10,2,10,"my experience might be different from other people but to me this hostel was not really a hostel that makes it easy to connect with other travellers. it is because it is also a hotel. it has a fancy bar and a fancy restaurant so when i ordered a soup that cost almost $10, i was surrounded by glamorous couples dressed up to impress. i was dressed in normal comfy clothes and it made me look like i don't belong there. the hostel was too impersonal and too posh. i would not stay there again. "
CzechRepublic,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i've ever lived in! you can not find second one like this for the same price
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i have ever been too by far. brand new so everything is in good shape and the atmosphere is excellent. location is good for downtown, close to the metro redline so getting to hollywood, universal studios, and even santa monica beach is quite affordable and easy. also, the roof top pool is amazing - looks just like the pictures. would highly recommend. note - i would say this is a more mature hostel, ages seemed to be more late twenties/early thirties based on my experience."
Canada,Male,31-40,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,"clean rooms, great staff, location made it easy to get around downtown. large personal lockers were helpful too. "
Colombia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is really cool, it has an incredible rooftop with pool and the whole place is impecable. the price was just perfect, i think because it is still in construction and there are some facilities that are not working.  highly recommended"
Thailand,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,8,6,8,10,8,this is a good place if you looking for hostel in la.
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent place to stay.  i really loved it...:)
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"beautiful hotel with rooftop pool in the heart of downtown los angeles. 7th street metro station a few blocks away, easy to get around los angeles."
Russia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel!
China,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,best hostel ever ! fancy design. close to the metro station. 
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,8,10,"this is a quite fancy hotel with the option of shared bedrooms and a basement kitchen. you can get the comfort of a pricey hotel for the not so pricey room rate. it opened a few months ago and it's located on a historical building, so everything is extremely new but some things are still under wraps. i think the main issue are the elevators, right now only two are working and run quite slow. public rooftop pool is a letdown, as it's often full of outsiders and guests can't enjoy it that much."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,could be the best hostel i've been to. amazing rooftop pool! 
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff at freehand la was superb and very hospitable. my roomates were very respecting and respectable.   
Austria,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it doesn't get any better than this. great location, cozy and clean rooms, gorgeous rooftop! worth the money!"
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,its the high end of the back packing lifestyle that's for sure. room and bed and bathroom we fabulous. you get to mix well with the people who are paying hundreds of dollars to stay here.  you will only ever buy one drink thats pretty pricey by cheap travellers standards here but do it on their amazing rooftop pool bar. great transport hub for all of la. supermarket just down the road and cool little bars and restaurants all around makes this an easy choice to go back too. 
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing place!! staff are all so friendly! everything is very nice and rooms are clean and bunks are very nice 
Spain,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one the best hostels i have ever been. the only problem i found was that the swimming pool wasn't opened. 
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really lovely place, with incredibly helpful staff. great bar and i enjoyed the access to the gym."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wonderful place to stay! really lovely and accommodating staff! i would recommend this place to all my friends. 
England,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,great hotel/hostel in a good location downtown. the pool area and communal area wasn't ready when i was there but imagine it would be amazing once opened.
Italy,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,4,10,10,10,"it's good, new and modern. the kitchen wasn't finished so that no kitchen or laundry."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such an amazing stay! super friendly staff too made it feel like i always had company on my solo trip. the atmosphere is also amazing, the location is perfect and the price was so good. would highly recommend!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"i really enjoyed it here, however i was disappointed as it was advertised to have a roof top pool. however this was not yet completed... "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,everything was so nice !      i suggest the following:      1) a microwave to warm up my food . . . . .   2) some hot water facility to make my own herbal tea.  3) a central/common kitchenette for additional convenience.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,8,10,10,10,10,"beautiful looking place - private rooms are new and amazing, staff are helpful, location is pretty good near metro stations and common bus routes around downtown and the rest of la."
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a must stay! lovely place and i had a wonderful time. clean, staff was amazing, great food and bar.    i will stay again.    thank you."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. super clean, nice new and modern. a shame the roof top pool and bar weren't open. would definitely stay/recommend again. "
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great place to stay in downtown, free breakfast was convenient but not always packed correctly, friendly &amp; helpful staff."
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,it was very enjoyable staying here. it covered all the basics apart from laundry facilities. the atmosphere was good but the staff are better. everyone i spoke to was extremely helpful so i can't fault the service. the location is very good in terms of accessibility however be cautious in the evening. the only negative (apart from not having a laundrette) is it is difficult to meet other backpackers unless you attend breakfast or are comfortable taking a gamble on talking to someone.
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amei o hostel, só acho que ainda podem melhorar no breakfast, fazendo com que haja interação entre os hóspedes, senti falta disso nos cafés da manhã ...mas de resto é sensacional!"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.4,8,10,8,2,8,6,10,"a pretty building with comfortable, modern rooms, the ensuite bathroom was especially beautiful! we were happy with the price, less happy that multiple advertised amenities (including the rooftop pool and kitchen) were not yet ready. quite odd staying here, this is a combo hostel-hotel-restaurant-trendy downtown bar. if you have nice clothes to hang out with la locals you might enjoy it, as normal backpackers you are totally out of place. stay elsewhere if you want to meet other travelers."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing place! i will definitely stay here again if i return to los angeles. staff were all super friendly and accommodating on my arrival, never received such terrific service before. location was central and convenient with public transport close by and lots of places to eat in close walking distance. beds and pillows were comfy and clean. lobby was super cool and made the place memorable."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,6,10,"really clean and new hostel-style rooms in what is really a hotel. included breakfast was a plus, however nothing fancy - some mornings included more stuff than others. the staff were very friendly and always happy to help. the location downtown felt as if it was in a fairly safe area. due to this being a hotel, there was no real hostel community feel. the other guests in my room seemed to only stay for one or two nights maximum.

Scotland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"amazing place to stay. gutted we arrived so late from lax and had to leave early the next day so we didn't get to make the most of the place.   i would definitely stay there again, staff were brilliant and we were upgraded which was a lovely treat after two days on airplanes/airports!   highly recommend freehand"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay, showered head pressure could be better but other than that was perfect!"
Germany,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"stayed for a week at that place. in my eyes it deserves 5 * out 5. usually i dont squander with perfect ratings like this, but freehand is outstanding in many ways. and that is mainly due to the fact it is a new facility (summer 2017). every unit (e.g. lift, toilet, bed) is in very good and clean condition. in addition different other positive aspects:    - beds are remarkably solid and firm. no squeaky metal bunk!  - good location ""7th metro center"" substation nearby.  - friendly staff    "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location and great staff! it's 80% hotel and 20% hostel, so the atmosphere is a hit or miss. everything else about this hostel is above and beyond!"
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very good, would stay again 10/10. don't be put off by the number of reviews, this place has just opened and is incredible."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,6,10,"sorry, i cannot give this place a better rating for now. as a hotel? 10.0 for sure. as a hostel? for now, it doesn't satisfy the hostel requirements in my books. they are in the process of finishing a common area with kitchen and a rooftop pool and bar, which will be amazing i am sure. they provide towels and there is a cool lobby bar, which is very pricey for backpackers. this is a fancy hotel, with dorm rooms. huge plus, there is ac. however, as a solo backpacker, good luck meeting people."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"freehand only opened two weeks before my visit so a few of the facilities were still unavailable but despite this i loved it here. the staff were incredible - super helpful and friendly, rooms and beds were very clean and comfortable with regular housekeeping, great restaurant and bar, and just good vibes all around. definitely not your standard hostel (it's more like a hotel with shared rooms available), 11/10 would stay here every time i'm in dtla."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the pros:  it’s a hostel so the price is cheaper when compared to the nearby hotels located in downtown la, about a 20 minute walk from the convention center. working thermostat. separate bathroom and shower. separate bathroom and shower.roof top pool and bar.indoor bar and restaurant. free gym. personal storage cubes.    cons: bunk beds were low. everyone hit their heads at least once. the elevators were down a few times. the staff helped drag all our stuff to our rooms on the 8th floor."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the freehand la was amazing! the staff were so friendly and helpful and the whole complex was incredibly modern and up to date. i would whole-heartedly recommend staying here. it's affordable, its a great location and the staff will go above and beyond to make your stay at the freehand and la truly excellent."
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"probably one of the nicest hostels i've ever been to, and it'll be even nicer when the rooftop pool opens! beautifully designed, high-end place, a far cry from the typical metal bunks and sparse rooms at most hostels - they have really awesome wooden bunks with outlets and semi-privacy for each bed plus spacious cabinets. fresh towels/sheets daily, fast in-room wifi, great location in dtla. only negatives: slow elevator (but they have one!) + could have more social events for hostel guests."
Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"from the great roof top pool, to the regular excellent freehand rooms, and amazing staff this is a great hostel (also boutique hotel) it is in the middle of downtown la so the area is sketchy and will be a few years before inner city development makes it quaint, but easy access to everything and subway only a few blocks away. i really enjoyed my stay here."
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i wasn't able to stay in the hostel because the building work was yet to be  completed.     the owners put me into a sister property, the line la hotel.  they have me a complementary  night and for the other nights, only charged the hostel rates.     this was excellent customer service.   "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"they had super customer service. i didn't actually get to stay with them, because they weren't open yet. so they put me up at their sister property and they were beyond awesome! "
Mexico,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great hostel! friendly and helpful staff, amazing location. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,8,10,"very nice restrooms and showers ensuite. beds are very nice. location is great if you want to stay in hollywood. no pool, but the patio area is nice. good wifi everywhere. towel included. breakfast included.  if your primary goal is to see hollywood, i would recommend this hostel.   if you are just visiting la, i would recommend stay at venice beach or santa monica instead.  "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,8,10,great organised activities run by the staff. nice patio and lounge room to meet new people. clean hostel with big kitchen. 
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel with large dorm rooms, super clean facilities, great location (especially for universal  studios) and very helpful staff in particular steven who runs the hollywood walking tour and runyon canyon hike... great guy! "
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,6,2,8,8,6,6,8,"didn’t feel super safe. a couple really weird incidents.. one inside of the hostel &amp; one just outside. a friend of mine and myself were locked out at a bad moment. decent cleanliness. some nice staff, some that left us out because of a situation just outside of the hostel but made the decision to leave us locked out. i get it that it was a hard decision, but probabaly not the wisest."
Ireland,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, good location, amazing free breakfast. excellent hostel."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this hostel is as good as advertised - the location is unbeatable, the staff are super friendly, and there are many activities planned for every day.    only issue for me was quite a major one - it had been a while since i'd stayed in a hostel dorm room and the curfew wasn't enforced so my roommates were awake with the lights on until 2am each night. i eventually made the switch to a private room, but even then the staff members would be talking loudly outside as i was beside the kitchen."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"nice place, great location. would recommend for a l.a tourist "
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,after staying at a few hostels in the la area usa hostels is bar none the best!  lightyears ahead in the details and quality over the others.  you won't go wrong at usa hostels.  i stayed there for 14 days max stay!
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"the stay at the hostel was good. the rooms were relatively clean, including the bathroom. the addition of a free breakfast was good, although the choices were pretty small.  i was able to fit my small airport sized carry on in the locker, which included a power outlet for secured in-locker charging. the bed was good. it included a privacy slat which included an outlet and reading light were good as well. everyone kept to themselves, no issues. "
Germany,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very happy to stay here. i would come back definitely
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,"nearly everything about the hostel was great! staff were extremely helpful, they ran tours around la, free breakfast every morning meant there was one meal everyday we didn't have to worry about, clean bathrooms and just a very friendly atmosphere. the only thing i didn't like was that there weren't any privacy curtains for the beds in the dorm i stayed in. overall a great experience though!"
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,nice hostel. 
SouthKorea,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved staying here  one day when i go back to la, i would love to stay here again"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i only stayed for one night but the location was perfect and the facilities were great. i went on the night walking tour and the staff running it were extremely knowledgable and helpful. being solo traveller and my first time in la i was initially a bit hesitant and a bit disappointed in la but once i went on the tour i saw what it really had to offer and thanks to the usa hostel staff in hollywood i was able to make the most out of my 30hours stay in la!
Brazil,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,6,8,"a localização é ótima, perto de praticamente tudo e fácil acesso aos locais, os tour que o hostel oferece são muito bons, super indico."
Canada,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"good location, clean and secure.  the only issue i had was with some staff.  not all, but i arrived 25 minutes before check-in time and he refused to check me in, only to watch him check in another guess 10 minutes later.  also, there were two extremely noisy and loud and rude girls in my female only room.  i asked to please be more respectful and they refused.  i brought it up with staff downstairs and they basically just said they have free earplugs.   other then that, everything was fine."
Spain,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"molt ben situat, net, cap problema. recomenable, hi tornaria."
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"nearby flyaway, hollywood street. good breakfast. and prepared earplugs for sleep.   but the bed creaked whenever upper person moved. it is noisy than i thought. however, if use earplugs, it does not matters.   i recommend this hostel"
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"overall the hostel was great, rooms were nice enough with dividers around the top of the bed which is nice for a bit of privacy. the breakfasts are great with a really good selection. there is lots going on with shuttles to the beach and tours pretty much everyday. there is a good guest atmosphere we met a lot of other travellers. most of the staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for you but a couple appeared rude and quiet arrogant. a great stay! "
France,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,very good hostel. good atmosphere. many young people . the pancakes were a real highlight in my stay
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it is great. the people who stay there. the staff is amazing. great location for anyone who wants to explore hollywood or even dtla, just a few steps from the metro. very clean.ifelt a part of a community, like a family. and i will definitely be back. keep it up hostel of,hollywood. "
Colombia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,6,8,10,"the best thing about this place are all the activities that are constantly going on! staff is nice and friendly, but they rather hangout with their other staff friends than with the travellers, so its a bit frustrating sometimes. the rooms are super clean, although they can become a bit hot if the fan is not turned on at its fullest. lockers are big and spacious. "
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,i booked two nights and i only wanted to stay one. they staff said i would be refunded for one of the nights and i never got my refund. 
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"for a hostel, this place is pretty clean. don't expect hotel cleanliness and hospitality, though. for example, expect to dress your own bed with the linens provided and you have to wash your own dishes after breakfast. you only get one medium sized towel so if you want a new towel, you have to get it from the reception desk. kitchen seating area is limited so you're likely going to sit with strangers to share a table. also i was put off that they used ""leftover bread"" to restock the breakfast."
Spain,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,just great!!! we will come back next time we visit the city!!! 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful service, great atmosphere, perfect location, and oh my is this place clean. i can safely say that when it comes to hostels in la, this is the only place i’d stay. "
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff were all very friendly and easy to talk to. there are plenty of interesting activities to do as well which is fantastic.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great a bbqm jjkh  to do everyday, very clean and also have quiet zones after a certain hour so you can actually sleep! great hostel! 10/10!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"i really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels hollywood. the location is excellent, the staff were nice and accommodating and the security was really good (even allowed me to store away extra bags for the duration of my stay). i also loved the activities that are run by the hostel."
India,Male,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,8,2,8,8,the staff at the desk was very rude and at times was partial towards me. no reasons for any partiality. talking to someone with a smile will not create any problem. i don't know why but the man at the desk was again and again asking me to show the room key as i was moving to the outer open area of the property (in a span of 15 min he asked my room key 5 times) . the same guy did not allow me to keep my bag in the luggage area reasoning it to no space when they had enough for another 30 bags. bad
Denmark,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"by far the nicest hostel i have ever stayed in, and this is considering everything from security, cleanliness, helpfulness of staff to the expanded breakfast with fruit and bagels and the patio where everyone is socializing.  have stayed in many hostels all over europe, but none have been as satisfying as this one.  thanks for a wonderful stay, would 10/10 recommend! "
England,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,the ensuite room with bunk beds was a little on the small side but it was clean and cheaper than a staying in a hotel. there is plenty of parking in the area and the hostel is a short walk to hollywood boulevard. we underestimated the size of los angles and its lack of public transport. we ended up keeping our hire car that we had used to drive down from san francisco as the distances between attractions/areas of la are huge and uber was going to cost too much. 
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,what a lovely hostel! free breakfast and coffee in the mornings and the staff are all very friendly.
Brazil,Female,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,10,8,best place to get to know people. the tours they organise are either free or a fair value
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"really good place. stayed as a single female traveller and felt completely safe the whole time. not a party hostel, but, there is a good atmosphere. there are a few bars within walking distance which was good. breakfast was basic but until a little later. would stay here again if ever in hollywood."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"all i can say is perfect as any hostel can be...i had a great time, and actually i did not sleep that night 😁"
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,직원들이 굉장히 친절했고 화장실이랑 침대 상태는 좋았어요. 숙소에서 나가자마자 워크오브페임이라 좋긴한데 공항에서는 멀어요. 어차피 la는 우버타고 다닐일이 많아서 위치가 엄청 중요하진 않은거같아요. 전반적으로 좋았지만 같은방쓰는 한국분들 새벽에 너무 시끄럽게하셔서 잠을 설쳤고 그거빼면 만족해요.
Singapore,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,the breakfast was simple but good &amp; the rooms and bathrooms were super clean! 
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,8,10,6,6,8,8,8,"it's a decent hostel that offers a lot of cool activities. the most activities i've ever seen and the tour guides are enthusiastic although they've done this a whole lotta times. the location is just off hollywood blvd in a sideroad that looks kinda sketchy but is actually pretty safe. hollywood is pretty trashy, though. the common room is the kitchen or the cool patio (which is not as practical in winter). i think in summer, this is a pretty good hostel, in winter, there might be better options"
Australia,Couple,18-24,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,4,8,if you are looking for a party hostel then this would be ideal. however it can be extremely loud at night with music (as there are speakers outside of the rooms even though the party is downstairs). very hard to get to sleep. one evening we also had somebody walk into our room (private room) with their room key which was concerning. great location if you want to be close to hollywood. 
Malaysia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,the staffs are friendly. there are a lot of activities. however，all the bed sheet and towel have a very strong smell which i found unease. the rest is perfect 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,made lots of friends here! would be nice if staff were a little more engaging though. free breakfast each morning was fantastic and the place was kept really clean.
Canada,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,was ok.. nothing too special.. i did like the way they store luggage in the luggage room. beds were ok. staff were friendly.. they should really have a swipe on the main entrance instead of having to show staff to let them buzz you in
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels. the location was central to most hotspots in la/hollywood, so i enjoyed that. i've staying in various hostels around the world before, and i was pleasantly surprised by the facilities at usa hostels. the bathroom in the room was clean &amp; nice. the bed were comfortable and i felt i had some type of privacy, even being in a room with 7 other women (i know it's hard to believe, but it's true.) my favorite part was the patio space in the front of the building."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,very chill hostel close to the sights in hollywood very easy to start conversations with fellow backpackers (something i found is not the case in a few other american hostels - other cities) it might not be as flashy compared to other hostels but it makes up for it by having much more social staff and guests i had a blast
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"so i stayed here for one night in a solo room, and it was tiiiiiiny. probably the smallest room i'd ever been in honestly. the outside area was really nice and the atmosphere was good if you were looking to go out. i stayed in another hostel right down the road though for the same price and had a way bigger room, but a more quiet scene. it all depends on what you want, but overall this was a nice place."
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel in la! awesome atmosphere and lots of (free) activities. you‘ll never be bored in this hostel. breakfast was also the best compared with other hostels in the us. 
India,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"located on hollywood blvd, this is a fantastic hostel and has very positive vibes. they organise a lot of events and have some really knowledgeable staff.   had a great experience and would surely recommend this to others. "
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,really nice hostel! facilities are great and the staff is very nice. coffee/tea all day long
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,6,10,10,8,8,"weird location right by hollywood, but hollywood is dirty and slightly unsafe at night. outside courtyard was fantastic, kitchen was great, breakfast was included. rooms were large and beds comfy, loved the privacy panel. staff were great at keeping tabs on everyone going in/out. loved the thanksgiving dinner. "
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very good location and amazing bathroom within the room. staff very helpful and really helped me enjoy my stay. 
HongKong,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,very pleasant experience staying at the usa hostel! everything has exceeded my expectation except the location is a bit rough at night.  
Hungary,Couple,31-40,6,4,10,2,8,4,8,6,"the building itself felt safe, but it is in a very bad area. it is close to the hollywood walk of fame, which turned out to be a horrible area after dark (5 p.m.). urine and pot smell, homeless people, beggars everywhere. some receptionists were completely stoned while working. during their kitchen shift, other employees were talking about getting high. this just gave the place a really unprofessional vibe and it made me feel like i cannot rely on the staff with anything. "
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,love it! stayed here on two separate occasions. best hostel in la.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"highly recommend this place. super central, so easy to walk anywhere. free shuttles to santa monica organized by the hostel, free dinners and lots of group activities to make it a sociable atmosphere. this is one of the best hostels i’ve stayed at and i’d definitely go back. staff are really friendly. only negative i’d say is the check in time of 3pm is pretty late especially when check out is 10am. pub crawl isn’t worth doing, better off doing arranging your own thing since the location is easy"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great staff, comfy beds and great places to put things so they're not stolen, great to socialise with everyone, good facilities for the bathroom. terrific"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place .. highly recommended 
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,would stay again 
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent i had a great time and met great people!!!!
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,good location to many bars and gimmickie shops. one issue: the smoke detector in one of the rooms was low on battery so beeped the whole night.
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,i last stayed at usa hostels back in 2008 and i had a very memorable experience.  fast forward to 2017 and the newly renovated hostel looked terrific.  it did bring back memories from 9 years ago and i still recommend this place.  i had no complaints overall.  it was also central to everything that i wanted to do.  staff were really nice and very helpful if you had any queries on how to find your way around and how to get to where you want to go.  
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"good location, facilities"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"really good hostel overall, beds are very squeaky and lockers are really loud but that can’t be helped. location is great and they offer loads of tours. "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location right off hollywood blvd and only a few blocks from the heart of the blvd. hotel was extremely clean and had great facilities. good security with desk monitored 24hrs and only allowed in door with room key shown. this was good considering the street we were on had a lot of people sleeping on the street at night. staff were friendly and down to earth. room was really nice and spacious and bathroom was modern and clean. bed was really comfortable and nice big lockers. breaky average
Germany,Female,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,"i have stayed in the hostel, because there is hardly anything cheaper in the area with the same quality. they offer a lot of free stuff - breakfast, bbq, drinks, activities... really very generous. only downside - if you are looking for a place to have a good night’s sleep, don’t go for this hostel. i’ve stayed for a weekend and both fri and sat night it was so loud and noisy with strong bases that you couldn’t think of sleeping before 3am... but what else could you expect in this location ;-)"
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"tl;dr - great hostel and staff. wish there was a bar.  the night staff deserves an award. specifically the assistant manager and the reception guy with shaggy red hair. the check in system went down for almost 3 hours and they couldn’t check anyone in. when i arrived around 11:30pm, i begged to just be put in a bed and they made it happen! thank you thank you! the rooms were clean and comfortable (although mine was baking hot - i swear the heater was on). breakfast was ok. wish there was a bar."
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved the hostel, it was really clean and i felt really safe!"
Sweden,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the hostel had a very good location in hollywood, los angeles. the staff was nice and the hostel was clean. the breakfast was good. the hostel arranged activities almost every day, unfortunately i couldn't participate in any of them because i was sick my whole stay. i think the hostel gave me good value for my money and if i ever go back to los angeles i would stay here again and hopefully get a chance to see something of the city."
China,Female,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,"this hostel is value of money, good location.a bar named tao near here is really cool!one tip for you: if you take grey hound come from sf,it's better to drop off at san ferendo which is closer than la downtown."
Philippines,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,stayed at the hostel for 2 separate nights and had great time. staff were very friendly and accommodating and there are events organized everyday. great breakfast spread in the morning and enjoyed spending time both at the indoor lounge/kitchen and the outdoor lounge too.  its about 4 blocks away from hollywood/vine metro train station where you can catch the bus to lax airport. great place. great stay. will definitely come back again :)
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,10,6,10,10,"some of the night staff weren’t very friendly, when i left my key card upstairs accidentally ( i was with a friend also staying at the hostel) they wouldn’t allow me to enter but also refused to look me up in their system. in that sense i guess you could say the security was a little too good. however, the beds were comfy and had outlets in each bunk and nice private bathrooms. they seemed to have lots of activities, however, we didn’t participate in any of them. close to hollywood! "
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a very nice stay at the hostel.  the one thing that you need to watch is parking.  i brought my car and had to utilize the public parking areas.  the average cost for parking overnight was 20 to 30 dollars.
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location n proximity to metro. in house tours n activities were free or cheap n tour guides were good fun. great brekky supplied for free, pancakes, toast, fruit n coffee. mmm. i stayed 4 night in a 6 dorm room, comfy bed with ensuite. the individual lights on each bed were handy. thx guys. i can highly recommend this hostel n would stay again no problem"
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,4,10,10,6,10,8,10,"try to request a room *away* from the disco hall, because it is really hard to sleep to the thump of 1980s music."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed at this hotel for a week while in hollywood. i was a bit apprehensive at first, because i understand that hollywood is a bit touristy. the hostel was fantastic though, rooms are cleaned everyday and the staff are so friendly and helpful. i really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels, i would go back in a heartbeat.  in the dorms, i appreciated the metal privacy screen with a shelf and charging plugs beside it (usb outlet also!).  free breakfast was fantastic, the free events are top notch."

Serbia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"where to start, first hostel is very nice, rooms are spacious and clean. biggest advantage of this hostel is that he is located in hollywood, and you really need 5 minutes to walk of fame. the hostel offers a lot of activity’s every day, like a free beach shuttle to venice beach and bar crawl (must do), free hollywood sign tours, hollywood night tours and beverly hills tour. one of the best values for your money! would definitely stay again.   p.s. the staff is awesome! kevin is real mvp!"

Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,very social. rooms fairly spacey. easy to meet people if you hang out on the patio or attend the hostel activities. sketchy people hanging around the hostel but security is good so feels safe. would go back again and recommend for someone who wants to stay around hollywood.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,6,6,6,8,6,2,6,8,booked into female only dorm room. woken up by male staff member at 2am shining phone torch in my eyes and yelling at me that i was in the wrong bed. turns out desk staff never told me to hang my receipt on my bed when i checked in. i was definitely in the right bed.
France,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,in the heart of hollywood. free breakfast and nice patio.

Mexico,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"good place to stay, a little bit expensive but everything in l.a. is around the same price, the place was clean and they have a lot of activities, staff are really friendly. "
England,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel. friendly staff, next to hollywood blvd and sunset. bars and restaurants close by which is always good! "

Ireland,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice, clean hostel, with good facilities. i especially liked the sockets in the lockers for charging phones and the free water refill station.  quite loud at night though and a younger crowd. not suitable for those travelling with kids. "
Italy,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"got the chance to meet lots of friendly travelers, different activities to join everyday, very clean building and rooms, and great party atmosphere after all :) i'd def come back ! recommendend 👍🏻"
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,4,8,6,6,4,2,8,they play the worst music ever really loud down the hall and the vibe is so bad. the staff don't care don't help with heavy bags and seem relatively oblivious to the needs of those staying there. the pillows are like a bag stuffed with cotton balls.   never coming back ever.  hollywood is a like a porta lou at the end of a week long festival 🙃
Canada,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my 4th stay here.everything about this hostel - the atmosphere, the location, the design of the rooms, etc. and especially the big front patio with the piped in music- is excellent."

England,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location and they run loads of tours which is helpful. we had private bunk room for 2 of us and it was barely bigger than a cell! warning! also if you are a light sleeper this is not the hostel for you as tends to be very noisy. can't fault the facilities or location though right off hollywood blvd, would go back."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was a great hostel, going into a big city like hollywood was intimidating but never felt like i needed to be nervous with this hostel. staff always made sure i was taken care of and had a good time! would love to go back"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,my time at this hostel was really good. the hostel organised activities each day and night which was great in getting to know other people. the location was right on hollywood boulevard which was great however i would not book in this area again as it was far away from all other attractions. security was fabulous especially at night with showing key cards. breakfast was great with a good spread and even pancake mix. full kitchen facilities are also available. 
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here over 4 times, love this place"
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"great experience. would recommend more group activities like heading out to bars/nightclubs at night with the hostel and others to join, and also group events where residents can all go to universal studios together !"
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,6,10,8,8,10,8,10,"i stayed in the 4 bed dorm ensuite and thought that this was a solid hostel with all the important features- spotless rooms/bathrooms, outlets inside the lockers and by your bed, great breakfast and staff who are friendly and very helpful- one of them, jake, even offered to help with a personal errand! amazing. oh and they have 420 friendly outdoor seating. really what else can you ask for? except for it to be cheaper. but then again, its hollywood/ca/usa so price is still right for what it is. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,4,8,8,10,location is perfect. just was so hot when i went and no air con or pool etc. but breakfast set up was good and staff provided free shuttles to beaches
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i spent 2 nights at usa hostels and it was wonderful. the place was so clean and everyone was so nice. i can't wait to come back next year!
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel ever. extremely clean, friendly staff, free breakfast in the morning. right in the center of all the action in hollywood...you can uber anywhere in la for cheap. i made a bunch of new friends in just two days from all over the world. you won't regret your stay here. i will be back 100%. thanks guys "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,"by far one of the best hostels i've stayed in. bathrooms were very clean, power outlets and shelves next to bed were convenient, lockers were big, and it was great meeting new people on the outdoor patio. location is a bit seedy as it is in hollywood but didn't feel unsafe while at the hostel. would definitely stay here again!"
Thailand,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,สถานที่ดีมากแต่แพงไปนิด 
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,6,10,4,8,8,6,10,rooms were clean and had everything you needed. staff were friendly but lacked introduction as we were not aware of any of the activities or facilities the hostel offered.

Australia,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,staff were very helpful.  room clean
Australia,Female,31-40,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,a lil far from the main strip in hollywood. rooms smelled funny. smell wuldnt go away. staff were ok. breakfast standard. although no milk which should b apart of standard breakfast. if theres no milk why bother offering breakfast at all. 
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,10,8,6,8,8,6,the location is good just off hollywood boulevard. i booked to go on the beverley hills walking tour through the hostel which was $15 - that paid for our bus fees there (3$) when we got to the end of rodeo drive the tour guide said we were 'free to do what we wanted to do' and directed us to the bus back which we had to pay for!! didn't really see a lot of beverley hills either. the kitchen is very small and cramped  for the amount of people staying at the hostel and breakfast is ok. 
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"loved the lockers, people, and vibes!! met some amazing people and would definitely stay here again!"

England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"superb hostel, my first time staying at a hostel and they have set the boundary. location was close to everything i needed and the use of über helped as well. everywhere was clean, beds were comfy also. free breakfast was great to. staff always try to make your stay comfortable and there is plenty of activities on each day. "
Colombia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,much better than the sf
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,usa hostels is a place to go where you can feel at home and meet people from all over the world!   the staff were super friendly and i really couldn't have asked for more!  thank you usa hostels!
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is possibly the best one i have ever stayed in. it is in a fantastic location in the heart of hollywood. there were so many activities organised through the hostel that i didn't need to plan my days as it was done for me, fantastic! katy, louie, tony, kevin, carlos and all the staff make it their mission to make sure everyone is having a great time. thanks a million to you all. hopefully see you all again! "
Australia,Male,41+,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,well run. a good option away from the beach. helpful vibe.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i have stayed at. very clean, nice rooms that are cool in the summer. some good group activities too! the staff i dealt with were helpful and positive."
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,10,6,this diamond in the rough was fantastic.  the shower in my room had hair on the floor which was not cleaned out during my stay.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"this hostel was fantastic! first time ever staying in a hostel. staff were really friendly and helpful, atmosphere was great and everyone staying in the hostel were friendly and just wanted to make new friends. new bathrooms in each room, comfy beds and a substantial breakfast in the morning! would definitely recommend this hostel to anyone :) "

Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,6,8,8,hostel was in a great location and was accessible to public transport.  staff were helpful when you asked them questions. overall was a good stay.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this is actually one of the nicest hostels i've stayed at. staff are super friendly and helpful, lots of activities and lots of free things/ events makes it good value for money. unfortunately i was travelling with a few other people and we already had plans for the short time we were there, so we didn't get to participate in any of the hostel's activities. but this place is perfect if you want to meet new people or don't have anything set to do yet."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of my favourites. perfect central location, staff were very friendly, outside lobby vibe was incredible, very easy to meet other travellers &amp; locals, perfect for a solo traveller like myself. "
England,Female,18-24,6.9,8,10,4,10,2,6,8,"this hostel claims to offer discounted entry into universal studio parks and a shuttle bus service to san fransisco. both claims are false and therefore misleading. the ""discounted"" tickets were the same price on the universal website. also apparently the shuttle service to san fran no longer operates. please remove it from your website. the only major downside to this hostel was the staff. they came across as rude and were vague when giving you information . they were not welcoming in any way. "
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,hollywood is quite run down which we had not expected and there is not an awful lot to do in the immediate area however the hostel was really lovely despite having noisy people in our room. the beds were super comfy and it was lovely to have breakfast before we started out. 
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,"nice clean and modern hostel, staff were very helpful and friendly. beds were great and had outlets on each one."

Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,4,8,6,6,8,"i didn't love my stay with usa hostels, but i wouldn't not go there again. la certainly wasn't my favourite city, and the location of the hostel didn't help either. i liked the facilities and cleanliness, but the staff could have been friendlier. "
India,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place right in centre of hollywood. amazing staff who chill with you.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. friendly staff.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"amazing place to stay if you are staying in hollywood, staff were amazing, tours and activities were great fun and the hostel had everything you needed. everything was clean and it was only a short walk to the subway station (5 minutes) and bus stops (1 minute)."
China,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this is a really safe hostel, and the location is very good. and the activities are interesting and the activities are worth to pay. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"everything was really great at usa hostels hollywood - especially for my first visit to la! the hostel was in a good spot to check out hollywood, the beds were comfy and facilities all you need. the best bit was the staff and staff run activities, notably the beverly hills tour (which includes a mini boom box), the friday night pub crawl and walk to the hollywood sign. i made really great friends throughout - thanks guys "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really great facilities - comfortable and clean beds and bathrooms. definitely a place to party if that's your thing. staff are really friendly and super helpful. they also have plenty of breakfast options and lots going around.
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very sociable hostel with good facilities and fun staff in a central location.
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10/10 will definitely be back.
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,6,10,10,6,6,6,6,"decent hostel. not the cleanest--showers were a little dank. not the friendliest staff either. the sister hostel in san francisco is much better. but, good location in hollywood--easy to walk many places. "
USA,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first time staying in a hostel was very pleased with the experience. staff was very friendly. great value in your money. clean facility. free breakfast and dinner which was really nice if you're trying to save money. and free shuttle to santa monica beach was also a great perk. 
China,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,10,6,10,8,"i met some really crazy people here, heard many interesting stories. i would say it was a very unexpected yet exciting experience. this values more than facility and the comfort of the room, and the room is pretty good."
Argentina,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,8,6,6,6,"nothing to complain about, i decided to stay here because i´ ve been to usa san francisco and usa san diego, so i had high expectations cause i had the best time in those two. good breakfast, good location. but the fact that they didnt have shared bathrooms beside the one in the room, made people come in and out the room all the time at every hour making lots of noise  the atmosphere so and so  "
Thailand,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel, helpful staff.  great value for money. "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,"stay was good. felt very secure with the doors past reception being monitored by staff.   the room was good, was cleaned daily as far as i'm aware although still felt slightly dirty but then that's hostel life.   the room had a locker for every bed which you bring your own padlock for. secure.  the worst part about it was that there was no aircon, only a ceiling fan which didn't do much to cool down the room it just pushed the hot air around in a circle.   at night it made it horrible to sleep. "
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i was staying here mostly to go to e3 so i didn't spend much time in the hostel but it was really clean and the staff made everything seamless. if how looking to stay in the hollywood area, i would recommend staying here."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,2,10,8,10,"really great hostel with fantastic staff, it's a shame that it was dampened by the fact there was construction going on, not quietly, the lounge was closed for renovation, the washing machine and dryers were out of order, and the wifi was intermittently dropping it's connection, which is frustrating. they also do not cater to gluten free in the included breakfast, so i had to purchase my own bread. besides this, very good hostel and most of the staff are great people. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,8,10,"great hostel right in the middle of hollywood. large kitchen available to guests with breakfast provided free. decent rooms and bathrooms. awesome outdoor area with lounges and umbrellas for shade. its a shame that the hollywood area in general is not the nicest place, very run down/dirty, but this is not a fault of the hostel. really close to the hollywood walk of fame, chinese theatre, etc. difficult to get to sites in other areas of the city due to la's terrible public transport.    "
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,"the atmosphere was great, was really easy to talk to people, make friends and mingle. breakfast was extremely good, you can make your own pancakes. i felt very safe in the hostel, entrance is always locked so not anyone can just walk in and out. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"loved the patio for hanging out. breakfast was good, staff helpful, handy location and near the metro and buses. party hostel (quiet after 11 rule not enforced) so light sleepers you've been warned!"
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,very good hostel. lots of great activities for the guests
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,6,10,10,good location. security in place for after hours and having a noise curfew in place allows you to get enough sleep if you don't feel like partying.  
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best american hostel stay. they have lots of group hikes, tours, pub crawls and parties. definitely perfect for solo travellers and those who want to have a good time. rooms were spacious and clean, good sized lockers and the staff were really friendly and involved! "
Singapore,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"location was superb, incredibly near to hollywood boulevard. also easy to locate if you are taking the $8 shuttle from the airport. i stayed in a 8 bed female ensuite, and i especially liked that the dorm was big enough for our luggages. the privacy pod by your bed and the strong wifi are two facilities i appreciated that the hostel provided for its travellers. the bathroom was kept clean but can be a long wait sharing with 7 other females. breakfast is simple. overall would recommend!"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,"great spot! i think what really made this place extra special was the hostel activities (hike to hollywood hills) and the patio which was super condusive to mingling with other guests/staff. only 10 mins from the main touristy bit of the hollywood walk of fame, chinese theatre etc.. kind of a sketch area but whatever. no matter where you stay in la you will have to cab around to see everything (ie west hollywood, melrose ave, etc) so we were fine with our chosen location. overall very happy!"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel, stayed at this and the san francisco branch. both great hostels with good communal areas. the bunks are comfy and well designed, especially the privacy screens and the lockers are big. plenty of organised events,of which i would have attended if i stayed longer. i felt very safe and welcome, and would definitely stay at one of tt he usa hostels again."
Vietnam,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,the location is perfect. easy to use public transportation nearby. they have pretty high security so i feel very safe staying there. staples for breakfast. nice patio. i'm very satisfied with my stay there :)
England,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"second time i've stayed here and i really like this place. great location for hollywood and also megabus/boltbus. always stuff going on, some at a cost and some free. the breakfast is top notch for a hostel. the only thing a will say is that it attracts a young crowed which can lead to noise at night with people coming back from bars and clubs at whatever time in the morning. so if you're a tad boring i'd maybe look somewhere else. but i would definitely recommend this place."
England,Female,18-24,4.3,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,"hostel was undergoing renovations (which are needed) so there was a lot of banging/drilling early in the morning (before 8am which is supposed to be quiet hours). there was no running water at times with no advanced notice (told the morning of by posters on the walls outside dorms which is of no use when you wake up inside your dorm and go to use the ensuite). staff were unfriendly, patronising and rude, i felt uncomfortable asking them questions, which put me off joining hostel activities."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great location from a tourist perspective. walk of fame around the corner. loved the activities! bed was great, room have bathrooms in them. not much to fault except the guy who checked me in was quite rude, more interested in being on his phone."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"travelled the us for six weeks and this was my favourite hostel! location is great, staff were fantastic and meeting other travellers was so easy! heaps of events and everyone is down for a good time. only booked 3 nights originally but ended up staying for a whole week. highly recommended for other solo travellers."
Sweden,Female,18-24,8,8,10,6,6,10,10,6,"great hostel if you're looking to meet people. activities are hosted out on the patio such as beer pong, bbq etc. they also offer day activities such as walking tours to beverly hills and hollywood sign which both were good. the staff is super friendly and helpful and hanged out with the people staying there. overall clean areas, nothing special. breakfast is great and towel is included. lockers in room and you need to show key to get in – felt safe. pods make the beds more private. great stay!"
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels hollywood. stayed for 5 nights and will be going back again for the last 2 nights of my trip. ideal location for hollywood and surrounding areas. plenty of worthwhile activities as well. i stayed in a 6 bed mixed dorm with en suite and i was more than happy with the set up and bathroom was cleaned daily. would 100% recommend! 
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"very nice hostel, very well located and friendly staff"
USA,MixedGroup,31-40,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,"they are centrally located to where i needed to be (downtown), and to be honest there are a ton of great things to do around the area. i got everything stated they give so the value for the money is great. the staff were mostly accommodating, but one guy came into our room and watched videos on his phone for about 2 hours &amp; it made me uncomfortable. they could clean more (sweep/mop), and the place was under construction so it was loud during the day starting at 7am despite still being quiet hrs."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome location with a good price. this is the spot to stay with friendly and informative staff. you will be in the center of it all and can easily take the bus, ride share and subway. "
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"only stayed one night but thought the facilities and location were excellent. we had a 2230 train to new orleans to catch and were very impressed that even after check out, they let us hang around and use the shower facilities (good to be as clean as possible before starting a 3 day train journey). we were very impressed and grateful."
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,6,10,8,8,"all together, the hostel was good!  bathrooms were clean but had a smell (i think the base of the toilets needed to be clean). beds and rooms were clean, comfy and secure. they had lots of events to get everyone involved! karaoke, free bbq, etc.. and they offer different events and tours daily. the staff were great, and the included breakfast was too. hollywood area in general gets a little sketchy at night, but it's a great central location and easy to get anywhere by bus from here! "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hollywood the neighborhood isn't for everyone (i.e. me), but the usa hostel was excellent. staff was very friendly and helpful. and accommodations were much better than some of the higher priced hostels nearer the beach. fair warning that it takes 90 minutes on the bus to get to the beach; the hostel has a occasional group shuttle if you can wait. "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"what a delightful hostel!  the rooms were nice, the kitchen well-stocked with tools, and the patio was fantastic.  it was nice to have a bathroom off of each bunk room.  the included breakfast was a nice surprise.  the bathroom off the room in which i stayed had just recently been nicely renovated, but the shower faucet handle fell off every time someone touched it.  the staff was generally friendly and helpful, if frequently busy.  i would definitely stay there again."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"all perfect, clean comfortable and the bed setup gave more privacy than other hostels.     only thing i would say is the shower was a little weak."
England,Female,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location in hollywood near walk of fame. can also do lots of tours from hollywood boulevard and get to universal studios easily. very clean spacious hostel with big lockers. staff were helpful and daily activities were great. break was amazing!!! spoilt for choice. definitely a nice safe choice for anyone wanting to explore la and meet new people. 
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my favourite place to stay when i'm in los angeles! 
Denmark,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,the hostel is very much like the hostels in europe.   the staff is super friendly and have a good spirit.   i stayed at a mix dorm (only girl) but it was nice. the hostel is a bit noisy but that is okay. the toilet and bath is in two seperate rooms at the room. that is nice.   it was a okay breakfast. 
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,the location was awesome and super close :) friendly staff !
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is amazing for all backpackers and tourists looking for a friendly atmosphere, close proximity to hollywood blvd and hostel organised trips and tours.     i would highly recommend to those travelling alone.     but, there is a 'constant' party vibe where certain groups of guys (some of who don't even stay at the hostel) are smoking and drinking all day and night, in the front courtyard. they're not all tourists, and they can leave a bad vibe and make girls feel quite uncomfortable.  "
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,great trip and had a great stay. staff were super friendly and the trips i went on were fun.
Peru,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was very clean. had activities throughout the week, which included pubcrawls and walking tours among other. the breakfast with pancakes and fruits is perfect to start the day! "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,6,8,10,8,8,"staff were friendly, i didn't really like the area. would use usa hostels again - in fact i stayed at the san diego hostel of theirs! the price is quite high but every hostel is in la so it's all relative. thanks team"
Turkey,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,8,10,"great hostel, but it is so close to the clubs. night time if your sleep is so sensitive you can have hard time sleeping. they may need to schedule more shuttle for beaches. area is full of homeless people. if you go out late prefer somewhere close to the beach."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"definitely a great place to stay, rooms are well maintained. welcoming friendly and accommodating staff. as a solo traveler i really enjoyed meeting other people on the group activities. "
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"good value for money considering hollywood, really helpful staff and i slept like a baby. was travelling alone and also felt safe "
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"usa hostel was a good place to crash for a couple of nights while i explored la. the rooms are small, there's one bathroom between 6 and the beds creak but as long as you have respectful roommates it's fine. just be aware if you need to get somewhere at a specific time, you might want to be the first one in the bathroom.   breakfast is a nice touch, fruit, oatmeal, coffee, bagels. didn't try the diy pancakes as i'm vegan but the rest was enough. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,4,10,8,8,10,8,10,"really great hostel! staff are very accommodating, breakfast is good, beds are comfortable and people are lovely! good area! "
England,Female,18-24,7.7,6,10,8,6,6,8,10,"rooms were a good size, one bathroom between 8 girls though can be difficult and there's only about 2 communal bathrooms for the whole building so would help if they had a few more. breakfast was good, activities were good.. maybe a bit too expensive but apart from that it was an enjoyable stay."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,"conveniently located in hollywood, but backs on to a big carpark which was very noisey at night time during my stay (people hanging out in their cars playing music). overall pretty basic but the breakfast was good. "
USA,Male,18-24,5.7,6,4,8,4,2,6,10,staff was super unhelpful and not interactive. spent a lot of time with themselves and frequently cancelled trips for the quests. many of times they would give wrong or bad information on the city and where to go as well. they also spent of lot of their time chatting or complaining or gossiping about which skin tones they liked the best. would definitely try a different hostel next time.
England,Female,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,4,4,8,"ok location,  easy to walk to the main attractions, although not always a pleasant walk alone later at night. rooms good and the ensuite is a bonus. good breakfast. came here from the sister hostel in san diego which had a much better atmosphere and staff. i found the staff (although not all) to be unhelpful, keeping themselves to themselves and not getting involved in actives or with guests. verging on rude when i checked out. planned trips were cancelled last minute without much explanation. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the kitchen is very well equipped and clean. the rooms have their own bathroom. the beds are a bit squeaky, but have usb charging ports, a shelf and partial walls for some privacy. the outdoor lounge area is nice for chilling and the location is great. the lockers require a lock with a thick shackle, but they can be bought at the reception."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stayed in a private for a night either end of our trip to california. nothing to complain about the hostel it is great.
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great hostel in a convenient location right between two metro stations. staff are friendly and helpful. the hostel is located quite close to the clubs around hollywood and has a large car park next to it where people gather at night so it can get noisy, so i do recommend bringing ear plugs with you so you can get some sleep. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here on a stopover to london &amp; loved every minute of it. the location is perfect and i met so many cool people. definitely hit up the bar crawls, it's an ideal way to met others. "
England,Female,25-30,5.7,4,8,6,6,4,6,6,"the hostel is conveniently located for visiting the attractions of la but i chose not to walk around at night as it was a bit seedy (lots of sex shops on hollywood blvd around the corner). overall it was very clean for a hostel, but i did find stains on sheets i was given! (they were replaced) the staff were unfriendly and cliquey. i didn't feel inclined to join in the events because they weren't welcoming. the only activity i signed up for, the beach shuttle, was cancelled without notice."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,"stayed at a bunch of hostels in la, this is easily the best. staff are great, rooms are great, kitchen/facilities are great. they offer shuttles to beach, walking tours and pubcrawls daily which is good because there's very little to do in la as a backpacker if you do not have a car.  not much of a vibe when i was there - but that depends on the guests, not the hostel. the music in the front courtyard is either to loud to have a convo or was just half a dozen people staring at their phones. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,6,8,the hostels location is and isn't good. it isn't because it is in a quite dirty area and is about 6-8 blocks from all the good stuff on hollywood blvd. i also wouldn't say it is the safest area especially for anyone travelling alone. breakfast was good but could do with more variety and space to eat. the patio at the front is a nice area to chill out. there are some cool activities you can do with the hostel and at night it is a great location for bars in saying that noise can get a little loud
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a wonderful time, the location was great, just next to hollywood boulevard. the hostel organized fun activities and the staff was fantastic. "
India,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great location, right the the hollywood boulevard. best place to stay if you plan to spend your day in hollywood."
England,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,"right in the heat of hollywood,not for the faint hearted.bit of the seedy end of the strip and can be grubby area,but dispite the hostel undergoing some room renovations the place was spotless.very helpful staff,always around.nice lounge area outside,a non smoking part which was great.bad point:non hostel standard lockers,small normal lock useless and needed to buy a big bulky lock.although luggage room on ground floor,had to bike lock my case as well as didn't feel secure leaving it without."
Canada,Male,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,8,8,6,8,"if you're into partying and meeting loads of people (like i am), then try staying at one of the banana bungalow hostels. this was the only problem i ran into - i had a hard time meeting people but i appreciate the effort the staff put into organizing events. everything else was superb - the rooms were clean, the breakfast was good (i loved making the pancakes in the morning), staff were friendly, very close to hollywood blvd., and i didn't feel unsafe walking to the hostel at night."
England,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8, i think for european standards this hostel isn't great but maybe compared to other hostels in the us it's really good? i'm not sure. cons: the breakfast isn't very nice and the rooms aren't the most attractive - the place generally doesn't look as good as the pictures. i stayed in a girls doom and they put a guy in my room for a day or so. i complained and they move him which was good. pros - good location and lovely staff. 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,great staff
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"thanks for the stay, it was an overall pleasant experience. a few things to consider is the noise, we chose a private room due to our short stay and really long flights on either end of our trip but the rooms didn't seem to block any noise from the hallway at all. the food in the vending machine was also a few years out of date which some people may complain about, we are the chips lol but thought you may like to know! we felt very secure and the hostel has good facilities! "
Austria,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"we really enjoyed staying here! the hostel was really great, nice staff, clean and a very good location."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the location and facilities are great. the people (staff and guests alike) were a bit more distant than what i'm used to -- even though the hostel seemed pretty full, it wasn't particularly lively.    we also had a bad experience with the people in our room who were noisy and would turn the light on in the middle of the night -- though that's hardly the hostel's fault.    overall, good experience besides the atmosphere."
Belgium,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,6,4,8,10,nice location &amp; tasty breakfast but some staff people were not really friendly! 
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the location is excellent and close to many things in 1 to 5-mile radius.  the staff was professional, always available and so willing to help and answer the best they could and anytime they were friendly, too!  the front desk didn't have extra umbrellas, or nail clippers and non-humidity hairspray (1 of few the things i couldn't bring with me through airport security), our room was very clean and not even a little debris.  large lockers for every bed, but only 1 bathroom in each room! :( "
Colombia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i never stayed at this hostel, hostelworld payment site crashed while i was paying, and i never got the confirmation e-mail. however, the staff at this hostel was so kind to cancel my reservation over the phone. i recommend the hostel, not hostelworld.com"
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was fantastic experience for first time experiencing hostels. all the staff were awesome and friendly. a lots of event and tours. it's good place to meet people around the world also. clean, good atmosphere, good staff, great location, and so economic. bty breakfast included and for dinner or lunch you can buy your own and cook. thanks "
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"clean, helpful staff, good location. "
Austria,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice and helpful staff, the breakfast was good, the tours nice and fun. "
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,6,10,10,6,the hostel was great. they had a lot of things to do together and events. the place was in a good location for everything i wanted to do and the staff was super helpful answering any questions. the place needs a big clean in the rooms. the shower area needed some work and there was an oder in some rooms. over all the place was great and those two things didn't affect my stay but there is room for improvement. 
Australia,Couple,18-24,6.9,6,10,8,6,4,6,8,"some staff members were a bit cold and rude others were really nice. very noisy, they don't enforce quiet hours which have signs everywhere from 11pm-8am so if you want somewhere you can sleep this isn't it, if you want somewhere you can party every night this is probably more your thing. overall comfortable stay, nice breakfast and generally friendly staff, just need to get that balance right with noise restriction as many other fantastic and lively hostels i've stayed at have."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,8,10,"friendly staff and fairly good facility. your basic hostel with lockers, lounge, and daily breakfast. they had daily sign up sheets for trips to the amusement park, beach, pub crawls and so on. my only complaint would be the location. the hostel itself is central however hollywood itself was not a place i would spend much time."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,8,4,8,8,6,10,10,"lockers aren't big enough for suitcases, so luggage is not able to be locked away. super clean and awesome breakfast!"
Australia,Couple,18-24,6.3,6,6,6,8,6,4,8,"not entirely at the fault of the hostel,  but we were desperate to get out. the staff were not too helpful and the private room we had was the bare minimum in quality."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"facility wise this was the best hostel i stayed at in the usa. plenty of room in the dorms, everything was clean and free breakfast was great. hostel activities were good and in a central location for la.   "
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i can wholeheartedly say that not many hotels or airbnb's that i've stayed at prior to this hostel made me sad to leave. this was my first time travelling solo in a hostel and i have no regrets and i will from now on always stay at hostels. usa hostels hollywood was amazing, filled with vibrant people and staff with lots of activities provided and free breakfast and clean rooms which provide an ideal scenario for making friends. the staff were amazing, just want to say thanks again!   chin x x"
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"really nice hostel, hollywood is a rough area but felt safe in the hostel. have stayed here once before and it was lovely to be back"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"third time at usah hollywood, always a pleasure. a lot of the staff members are still there from 3 years ago and it seems like they love their job. bed was good as usual, breakfast good as usual and overall a great stay as usual. number one place to stay in los angeles. thanks again guys. "
Scotland,Female,31-40,8.9,6,10,8,10,8,10,10,"has good facilities and were very accommodating of my early arrival. some good free activities also. did overcharge me but we worked it out. was also my first experience of a mixed dorm which turned out to be one female (me) and five guys, which didn't feel very mixed! close to the metro and views of the hollywood sign from the common room. "
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i would definitely recommend staying at this hostel cause it's super close to everything and the staff is friendly!  the rooms are nice and you meet a lot of nice people!
England,Female,18-24,5.4,6,6,8,4,6,4,4,staff could have been more informative. dorm was unclean and very unfriendly which ruined my hollywood experience. 
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, great people staying in the hostel, good extras such as walking a tours and shuttles to santa monica "
SouthKorea,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,staffs are kind and its location is perfect~
Chile,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,good staff and location  easy to meet people and have fun!  terrace to chill out amd drink!
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the cleanest hostels i've ever stayed in. every morning there are staff cleaning all the rooms and common areas. the location is fantastic - just off hollywood blvd. walking distance to chinese theatre and runyon canon. short uber to downtown la too. the breakfast was average, could have been more. they have baggage storage free of charge with no time limits. head boards for extra privacy in rooms. free to change linen/towels whenever you like which was great and they had a laundry. "
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really enjoyed my stay the staff where so friendly and helpful i would stay again. clean and tidy. in a great location. great atmosphere and very fun and friendly. 
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a very nice hostel right off hollywood boulevard. for it's location, the hostel is very clean and nicely decorated. simplel but good. the kitchen is fully stoked and the atmosphere was really cool, too. i've only stayed for 3 nights but would recommend the hostel to anyone who wants to be right in the middle of the hollywood madness. "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"wonderful hostel, great staff, super clean, many activities "
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,6,8,10,"staff were ok, but generally kept to themselves and were unapproachable. facilities are clean and a a great value for your money. feels very safe and secure considering it's just off the busy hollywood boulevard. love that the hostel offered lots of free activities (walking tours, shuttle busses, bbq's). do these activities if you're trying to meet people! overall good hostel. "
China,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,it was pretty awesome staying in usa hostels hollywood! i may choose it again when i visit la next time
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great staff and clean facilities. will definitely come back.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a great hostel right in the middle of hollywood. the facilities were always clean and the free breakfast never ran out.  the large kitchen makes it a lot easier for travelers on a budget.  the staff were helpful and have plenty of local knowledge.
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,great location and awesome activities!
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"good hostel, great location just walking distance from the strip and nightlife. didn't do many of the activities but the hostel put on a comedy night for free and it was pretty good. beds/rooms/bathrooms were all fine, beer pong table sucked but the upstairs common room is good for pres and comfy couches. no dramas staying here."
Argentina,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i""ll be back definitely! "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"i really like staying at this hostel, but the last couple times i've stayed here, there has been a problem with quiet hours not being observed. on my last visit there was a fight that broke out at insane-o-clock in the morning. in the middle of the week. and that was one of two that happened during my last stay there.     that being said, it's still going to be one of the first places i consider when i go to hollywood. but i really hope that the issues with quiet hours are addressed."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"pretty sweet hostel, good location just off hollywood boulevard. 10mins from universal studios, cab ride away from santa monica.   everyone is really nice and chill 👍🏼 "
India,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"gosh i love this place amazing atmosphere located right off the hollywood blvd, the most fun place to be in los angeles.    i have made some great friends whom i would love and cherish for many ages to come    hostel staff if you're seeing this please send my regards to fraser and alvi the fun staff in entire hostel  and to another staffer whom we met during pub crawl (sorry forgot your name) we had so much drunk talk that day :)    thank you  - crazy indian"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"location was great, if you like hollywood blvd, which we didn't. however the security etc was awesome and the staff were great.     the group activities here were a real standout. "
England,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"the hostel is in a great place for metro/ connections/walking. it's clean and for the most part, the staff are helpful. only two out of all i dealt with were clearly not putting effort into their jobs.     the only con for me was noise. at the weekends, the hotel or neighbourhood is loud till around 4am. having arrived after a long flight on a saturday, it was frustrating. the rest of the week was better but there were people coming in at all hours who didn't seem to respect the quiet rule.  "
Belgium,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is an awesome hostel smack in the middle of the famous hollywood neighbourhood. beds were good. wifi was good. you had a lot of choice for breakfast (and good coffee!). they had activities going.   there just was this great vibe.   next time in la, i'll definitely come back to this hostel! "
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"good location for all hollywood attraction including theme parks, and a really nice hostel."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"had an amazing time here, came back a second time a couple weeks later. made some great friends and loved the atmosphere. staff were great, especially louis and fraser who made an already great time even more fun. tours and bar crawls are affordable and unique. location is great, la is huge so anyone who's not happy with being next to hollywood boulevard is just plain picky. had a great time, thanks a lot :)"
NewZealand,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"staff were helpful,  had a good time, met some nice people.would recommend to friends,a place to stay."
Belgium,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place, would go back in a heartbeat! "
Argentina,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,10,it's ok for couple of nights. not that much to do near location.
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,great hostel and great location. staff are friendly and helpful. room size is good and clean. if on the car park side of the hostel you will need ear plugs as you can hear the music from clubs on hollywood blvd. 
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,10,6,6,6,6,"i was in the very first room, which is right next to the door (which slams every time it shuts, no hydraulics to let it shut softly), across from the kitchen, and right underneath stairs to the second floor. it was extremely loud all night as quiet hours were definitely not observed or enforced by staff. this hostel was worth it for me only for the convenience to the pantages theatre which is less than a 10 minute walk away, and the only reason i went to la was to see a show at the pantages."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel in great location. definitely stay here.
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"first time staying at a hostel and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. aside from being extremely clean-conscious  (all they do is clean!) they were humble, friendly and willing to go above and beyond. example: i'm a non meat eater and one night they had a free bbq for guests. i asked if they had veggie burgers and they declined. a few days later one of the staff told me they'd gone out and got veggie burgers for the next bbq. really?! talk about excellent customer service! pleasant stay. "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"greatest hostel i've ever stayed in :)! the staff are awesome major points to fraser and jack - you guys are wonderful. the room / bathroom were clean and tidy, bed comfy and the atmosphere was fantastic. free brekky is awesome and the events the hostel have on are super fun. my only downside was friday and saturday night the outside noise from clubs near by was pretty noisy but with a set of earplugs its fine. will definitely stay here again 10/10 "
England,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good atmosphere out on the patio to meet fellow travellers! liked all the organised trips , some free ! good breakfast  especially cook your own pancakes !"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you are looking for a very social, clean and safe hostel this is a great choice! had such a great time staying here, met so many awesome people. really good vibes, plus very safe and clean! "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,all you can ask for in a hostel.
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i've ever been in usa. 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,awesome place to stay. our dorm (mixed 8) had its own bathroom facilities. activities on every day. free breakfast (which includes pancakes) everyone was very friendly.  
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,great stay
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,8,8,"definitely right in the middle of hollywood, decent place. i'd stay again."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i have stayed in
Scotland,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,v good and sociable atmosphere in a good location. staff very helpful and friendly. 
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,10,8,8,10,"if you get given room 104, ask for another room, no, demand it. right opposite the kitchen, and next to the 'front door' to access the rooms.. very, very, very, very hard to sleep with people talking and it eching plus the horrid buzzzzzz of the door being open (and slammed). awful sleep and very very average mattresses"
Greece,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"take more care of your staff! ;) otherwise, rock on!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"adequate facility for the area. good staff and good vibes during my stay. location is fine but some might find it seedy at times. breakfast is a big plus, as were the sleeping arangements (enclosed bed heads for privacy). l.a doesnt really have a centre but this would make for a good base to see the hollywood side of things and the hills, (griffith park/runyon canyon) metro train isnt too far either, which would make easy connections to santa monica and downtown. would stay again"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,10,6,8,6,6,8,rooms are nice and beds have there own light and power point. location is good however hollywood isn't really a clean place. staff were great minus one who i witnessed yelling at a customer. most of the activities they put on got cancelled because of low numbers. but overall not a bad place if you're after a comfy bed for cheap price.
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"although the overall cleanliness of the hostel was great, the small things such as the lack of fitted sheets, minimal options for breakfast, the staff being about average, its definitely one of the best hostels i've stayed at. the location is superb."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved this place. super easy going. very accommodating.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place! good outdoor area for meeting other people and the hostel put on some great events (bar crawl/hollywood sign walking tour etc). good location for getting around la (near universal, not too far from santa monica/venice, and obviously great location for hollywood)."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice place
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,6,8,"comfy beds and clean linen, breakfast was not massive but fine and all the staff were helpful. i would stay again "
Mexico,Male,31-40,5.7,2,6,8,6,6,6,6,"i don't like the fact that we check in at 2pm, but we have to check out at 10am. that is very inconvenient. my flight was not due until way after 10am. it's basically throwing us out into the street. if the facility is open 24 hours a day, we should be able to check out at 11 pm or 12midnight, because technically that would complete a day, and get our money's worth. and the breakfast selection, i didn't see any eggs and bacon. "
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,4,6,10,"guy who runs the bar crawls was very poor. refused to even start the bar crawl on the friday and saturday because there ""weren't enough girls in the group so we wouldn't get in"" all of the group then went off together without him and managed to get in everywhere. i can only guess he couldn't be bothered. get rid. other than that. great hostel!"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place in a great location. staff was super friendly and the other tendants were friendly and respectful. 
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great service, and we were able to book and print our tickets for universal studios there! no parking, but they are upfront about this on their website and we found parking easily nearby. very friendly and helpful staff. found it a bit noisy, but we were trying to sleep at slightly odd hours after a long haul flight, there were no noise issues at night. "
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"wonderful location/staff, very colorful and well maintained hostel.   has numbers of activities travelers can enjoy, pancake breakfast, common area(patio&amp;lounge) was roomie and isolated from rooms-so good for late night chatting.   only one bathroom per room-even for 8ppl dorm was the only perk(have 1 extra toilet&amp; 1 toilet/shower in lounge)   but i'll still definitely stay here again when i visit la next time.   thank you all!! love you xoxk "
England,Male,25-30,7.4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,"definitely one of the better hostels i've stayed at - comfty beds, nice bathrooms, a good selection at breakfast and the vast majority of the staff were friendly and helpful. one thing i would say though is that some of the activities felt like a bit of a money-grab at times. i genuinely don't know where the money went and if it did cost that much to put the activity on, it shouldn't do."
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,4,8,8,10,8,6,10,breakfast here is really good and the staff works hard to keep everything clean and tidy. so if you want a very clean and nice hostel this would be good for you. however there are comparable hostels out there for better prices.
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel, would recommend to anyone, would 100% stay again, traveled alone in the beginning of october and didn't think there would be a lot of solo travellers cause travel season was over but i met loads of other solo travellers and had a great time."
Chile,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i ever stayed.  it has a lot of (friendly) staff, so the hostel is always real clean. i f you want to stay in hollywood the location is perfect, they also offer loads of activities and freebies every day. the breakfast was a big surprise for a hostel, beds where comfortable with free linens, towels and big bathroom and shower on every room. i'm not sure if it was the date (october) but i was travelling by myself as most people in the hostel so it was easy to make friends."
England,Male,25-30,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,8,it was a good location and the rooms were very clean. the bottom bunk was a bit cramped but did the job. staff were friendly and the airport shuttle convenient. 
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay but it is right next to nightclubs and on saturday night it gets extremely loud, i had just arrived on a long haul flight only to get little sleep from the noise. however its so close to everything which during the day is a bonus that overrides a lot of that negative.  i'd also like to point out that activities are run based on having enough people, which means things can be cancelled even if you want to do it. not a major thing but was a minor annoyance for me."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"the hostel was really clean, the beds were comfortable, the building was safe and secure. the hostel had things to do: events and such, which is helpful if you like those things. staff was helpful as well. the breakfast in the morning was healthy. i had a nice time :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing! i've been hostelling throughout europe with others but never had so many activities and free things to do before. this is great especially as i'd just arrived from australia and was a lone traveller. met lots of great people in the common areas and staff were always able to help. only downside was that it was super hot when i was there but nothing they could do about the weather. thanks again!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"was a good place to stay, close to the main locations im hollywood. staff were helpful. room was a bit tiny but the bed was really comfortable. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"everyone was really lovely, i felt very welcomed. the downstairs outside part was great to meet people and socialise "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,solid hostel. decent location for hollywood and good amenities. free bbq monday was an unexpected treat.
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,awesome experience!
Ukraine,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i can characterize my stay in this hostel as simply ""wow""!"
England,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,great hostel. the patio area is the reason this hostel is so great as its perfect for meeting other people. activities several times each week some free some paid for. only downside is that my room was at the back next to the car park and people would park in there and play music all night. my room had air con but believe some of the rooms don't have this.
Serbia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect hostel!!
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great hostel. safe place, good activities and tours and the location was right on the main strip. would definitely recommend."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"i had a lovely one night stay in this hostel! the pancakes are amazing for breakfast, the rooms are nice and spacious, just the bathroom was a little messy (but that was due to the other people staying in the room). they had a nice socialising area with sofas and a tv, but as i was only there for one night and a solo traveller i didn't use it as much. there's many activities on offer so definitely do one if you can! the club crawl is very fun. would stay here again if i come back to la!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,absolutely loved the west hollywood location. everyone was super fun and nice and the outdoor patio was perfect for gatherings and chilling. the wi-fi was great and the free breakfast was quite a bit. i was surprised at the pancakes and fresh fruit for breakfast. 
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"the staff were all largely helpful.  the lockers had outlets inside to power electronic devices.  the bunk beds also were of higher quality, allowing for electronics to be plugged in and a sense of privacy.     "
Thailand,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,6,i like this place which located in hollywood but the room in not that good. anyway it was convenient.
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this was the first time i have stayed at a hostile,it was very nice and the location and price were grate ."
Slovenia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best place to stay when in hollywood.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel would highly recommend 
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,10,8,8,6,"location is great if you want to be close to hollywood, staff working out the back were awesome, front desk staff were ok. beds comfy, like plugs and light and the little bit of privacy each bed has. bathrooms in each room are great. rooms could be cleaner. "
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,6,6,4,8,8,"too highly rated for what it is. location of the hostel isnt to far away from everything approx 5min walk. staff at desk in the morning were ok need to work on customer service skill, the young guy that works in the kitchen area was a great help. free breakfast, overall cleanliness was good. theres lockers in the room to store valuables. hostel has a common area where you can byo alcohol and run an event everyday such as tours &amp; pub crawls."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,this is a really good hostel for the average traveller. it&amp;#39;s location to hollywood blvd is ideal and is also in walking distance to melrose ave. great hostel and would definitely reccommend
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,only stayed in this hostel for 2 nights but i didn&amp;#39;t want to leave! such a great atmosphere and all the staff were really friendly! would definitely reccomend this hostel.
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice place , i stay only one day but , all is correct in general "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,second time i stayed here and can't fault it! staff are super friendly and helpful. 10/10! can't wait to come back.
HongKong,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"they organise really cool activities to bind people together, got a huge ass karaokee room and the staff are sooo chill and helpful. free drinks :d everything is so organised and well furnished, the rooms are really secure, they basically give you a token and they'll only unlock for you when they see it haha the location is within walking distance to the boulevard, you'll enjoy anywyas :d "
Morocco,Male,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i ve been to three usa hostels (la, sf and san diego). i am a fun!  some of the best beds from all the hostels i have tried so far. good facilities and friendly staff, mainly volunteers travellers."
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,6,6,10,10,10,10,10,it&amp;#39;s an incredible hostel filled with activities for people and a staff that is friendly as times. overall if i go to san francisco or back los angeles you have my reservaton
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"great place to stay, we also stayed in their san fran hostel, also amazing. a great place to stay, and right on hollywood blvd."
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"this hostel was a bit pricey, but it seems to be the case all over la. the rooms were clean and the staff friendly. free breakfast was a nice perk, although the room was a bit small for the number of people in there so finding a place to sit and eat was challenging during peak hours. honestly didn't spend a ton of time in the hostel outside of sleeping and breakfast, so it met my needs just fine."
Canada,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,6,8,"greatly located within hollywood, but i was there during weekdays so nightlife was not really there. they clean the floors and rooms everyday which is nice, facilities is not a new building, but it's relatively clean (washrooms as well). the hike organized by the hostel is quite nice. if i were to stay in hollywood again, i'd stay there again. i would recommend it if you go to hollywood"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was the most amazing experience of california! a few minutes away from the metro, anything you need if right on your doorstep! the staff and the visitors combined made the experience the best! right on hollywood blvd. and it was so sociable!! would return here 100% "
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel with lots of activities available. great location just off hollywood blvd. free breakfast was excellent. good atmosphere. clean and secure. 
Canada,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,would recommend the comedy show on thursdays and sundays
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.3,6,8,8,8,10,10,8,"a little bit expensive for what you're getting - this is pretty much your bog standard hostel. great party atmosphere with good events and tours arranged. location was alright but sometimes i felt a little uneasy walking home alone at night! clean, large rooms and a nice outdoor seating area! "
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"though i wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily recommend staying in hollywood, if you are then this is a good base. right off hollywood and sunset blvds. hostel runs activities every day though they may be considered a little overpriced, the guides are friendly and well informed however. staff seem to constantly be in and out of rooms which can be a tad frustrating but all are friendly and extremely happy to help. i recommend getting to breakfast early as supplies deplete quickly."
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,8,4,6,"first hostel i stayed in the us and not too bad, but definitely not great. the front desk people are pretty friendly and helpful in directing us to certain locations. i was given a list of places i can go along with how to get there. there are also daily activities you can sign up for, but you have to do it quickly for the spots tend to fill up quickly. a lot of people come and go for the hostels in the us are a bit more expensive than other countries. overall ok, bathroom a bit dirty. but 怎么办？"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"usa hostels was my first stop on my trip! staff were super polite and helpful, my dorm was clean and the mattress was so comfortable after a long haul flight! hostel is central to absolutely everything in hollywood. "
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,6,8,8,8,6,6,8,good location in hollywood. clean and organised. lots of activities. some staff great others unhelpful. lots of rules.
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i&amp;#39;ve been travelling for over a year, and this is hands down one of the best hostels i have stayed in. i was originally meant to stay for 2 nights and ended up extending to stay in california for 8 days. the hostel was super clean, safe and in a pretty great location. it had an outside smoking/sun area which was really social. the hostel ran pretty awesome trips every day which included pub crawls, beach shuttles, hikes to the hollywood sign... 10 out of 10. breakfast alright - its free. "
USA,Male,41+,6.9,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,"perfectly acceptable,  though it seems to think very highly of itself.  they do not honour the deposits made on this website so you will be charged extra if you book here. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,this hostel is great. they&amp;#39;re in a good location and the staff were very friendly but the airconditioning in my room didn&amp;#39;t work which was annoying. it was very hot and uncomfortable to sleep in. other than that though it was fun place to stay.
NewZealand,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very comfortable and clean hostel,great place to stay for budget accommodation. "
England,Male,25-30,5.1,4,8,8,4,6,4,2,"traditional style hostel, en-suite bedrooms with small metal bunk beds.     poor sound insulation, you will hear loud music, people shouting, smashing glass in the evening. in the morning, you&amp;#39;ll hear cleaning machinery, vehicles, etc. in general, this hostel needs a major upgrade. thin curtains, street lamp can shine through.     towel had yellow grey stains on, bathrooms can be cleaner.    outdoor area was full of people smoking too.    good things? its in a great location and good activities!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is super close to everything, just off hollywood blvd (a little noisy at night when the clubs are still pumping and the jet lag is setting in - but definitely not a deal breaker!). the activities they run at a small fee are fab and fun! the rooms are so clean and the ensuite in each room is the best! they also have a privacy screen near your head on the bunks with a powerpoint and light attached which i think is a bloody good idea! will definitely be back if i'm ever in the area!"
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,the place is nicely located but i was unimpressed with the common bathrooms as there&amp;#39;s no privacy when someone uses the toilet. also no air conditioning. 
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,10,10,10,8,nice place!
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place
England,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"really great hostel. right round the corner from hollywood boulevard. spacious, clean rooms and bathrooms. really good security. especially enjoyed the activities they put on, i did the griffith park hike which was fab and the beach shuttle. noisy roommates but that can&amp;#39;t be helped. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,good hostel and great if you want to stay right in hollywood. 
Philippines,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff was great. room, beddings, toilet and shower room were clean. overflowing free coffee and tea 24x7. staff were so accommodating especially matt who was very helpful with my luggage. great cx. i will surely stay again in this hostel in my next visit to hollywood."
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,8,10,"this hostel okay. after reading multiple reviews, i decided to choose this one. the location is great for the nightlife, with tons of clubs within walking distance. breakfast was decent and the atmosphere was fun. only issue i had was on my last night. a guy who wasn&amp;#39;t a guest was starting problems and we almost fought he claimed he worked there but come to find out he was just a friend of an employee. he threatened to jump me everyday for the remainder of my stay. thank god it was my last night"
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,8,2,6,8,"overall the hostel was clean and well equipped for travellers of all kinds. my boyfriend and i stayed in a private room which was nice but rather small for two people. the hostel definitely attracts young travellers rather than those who would prefer a quieter hostel. the staff were friendly however they were very noisy, particularly in the mornings, and the amount of staff working there was a bit overwhelming at times."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazed at how clean this place was. 6 person dorm ensuite was cleaner than my bathroom at home. great vibe, good location, great staff and great activities. couldn&amp;#39;t fault the place.  can get warm in the rooms at night but we are talking about july. would stay again and again. "
England,Male,18-24,8,6,10,8,6,8,8,10,"the hostel is in a good location in the heart of hollywood just off hollywood blvd. as with anywhere in la expect a 40min uber to anywhere else (beaches etc). the hostel is kept clean and tidy and has regular events which are good for socialising, the only thing i would say is there needs to be a few more toilets.    overall a very good hostel!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,i was travelling on my own and as a girl i was pretty apprehensive about staying in hollywood but was glad i stayed here :)    the hostel is just off the main street so is busy at all times. just be careful not to be walking at night especially if you are on your own. only down side was that a few homeless people came into the outside patio looking for ciggarettes etc.     the group activities were amazing. met so so many people on the pub crawl and stayed frienly with them throught my stay.    
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great location hostel, clean rooms, great staff and free pancakes ! couldn&amp;#39;t really ask for more "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"overall it was a great stay. the location is great, it&amp;#39;s right off hollywood blvd so all the main spots at hollywood are walking distance. they organize daily events both during the day and evening, which is great for getting to know fellow travellors. only minor issue had was where a day trip was fully booked, however a staff member advised the day before to still turn up but i was met with a slightly rude shutdown on the day which wasn&amp;#39;t great. "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,"hostel was in a great location, only a short walk to hollywood blvd. lots of activities and events which was awesome and really helped the atmosphere. the free breakfast was cool. sometimes it took a while to be seen at the front desk due to the number of people but the staff were mainly helpful and friendly. hostel was clean but the sheets and towel i was given were stained and this made them feel unclean. overall, pretty good. "
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best place i have ever stayed at. loved every second i was there! the staff were the best and made me laugh constantly. friendly, inclusive and fun. this was the start of a 5 week trip and i didn&amp;#39;t want to leave!!! thanks do much for an amazing experience...will never forget it xxx"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first time staying in a hostel ever. friendly staff &amp; great people made some new freinds!  
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"lots of cheap tours available to any guest - did the hollywood sign hike with matt and he was super informative! the hostel was very clean, in a safe area and super nice staff! free breakfast and wifi made life super easy whilst traveling and the hostel is in a central location which means ubers are easyyyy! best hostel!!! "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this was my first time staying in a hostel. i had conducted my own research before i made the decision to stay in this hostel and well i wasn't disappointed. it worked out to be a lot better than i thought and i am glad i made the right decision. the staff were very helpful, and were very accomodating. honestly i do not have any complaints. the only suggestion i would make is, if the hostel would make an investment into an air conditioner as it would help keep the place cool when it gets hot."
Indonesia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"everything is good. i love this hostel and surely will come back and stay here again if i come to la again. location is really close to hollywood walk of fame and they prepare some free activities that unfortunately i cannot join because of my full schedules. just one thing , that one of the employee ask me for money when i want to keep my luggage in the storage early in the morning while i know usually keeping your luggage in the storage will be free of charge. "
China,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,"before i going there, i viewed the comments on the website, which said it was a fantastic place to live. however, i didn&amp;#39;t have a pleasant time there. i lived in a room of 8 people and almost lost my sleep all the night because my roommates returned back after 12pm and someone snored annoyingly at late night. besides, the breakfast was not as good as the hostel i lived before. i would not recommend this place to my friends any more."
Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel!!! 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,i only stayed here for 2 separate nights but thoroughly enjoyed my time. the staff were excellent and very helpful! the events looked great- although i didnt get a chance to do any of these. very clean and loved the shelf with power point and light for each bunk. 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, fun and enthusiastic staff, great activities, and generally a clean and well-functioning hostel. "
England,Couple,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,good location and staff were friendly. free breakfast is a bonus! however dorm and bathroom were messy and shower was a little dirty. other than that it was a good stay.
Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really liked this hostel. one of the best hostels i've ever been! staff is great and atmosphere is awesome too. i met some great people there! also, location is right on hollywood boulevard. highly recommended!!"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,good central hollywood location with very friendly staff and a number of activities each day. good beds and the lockers with a plug inside were particularly handy.
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,very nice property. cool outside area. there was a heat wave when i was there and the room was way too hot. 
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel is in a really great location in hollywood. it feels safe and the atmosphere is great. there was a friendly buzz about the place which made it easy to meet people and there seemed to be a lot of organised events for people staying there.
Australia,Female,31-40,5.7,6,8,6,6,2,4,8,"the rooms were nice, and the privacy screen with personal electrical points was appreciated. location - unsafe and unclean. we were hassled on the street at all times of day, and even with a group we felt very unsafe.  once you left the hostel everything smelled like a toilet. our biggest gripe was that the reception staff were incredibly unhelpful and disinterested - especially shelby, who we unfortunately dealt with multiple times. breakfast was pathetic. would not stay there again."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,10,8,8,my boyfriend and i stayed in a six bed mixed dorm with ensuite. the rooms are a great set up with own light and screening. staff were very helpful for tips around town and travel options. hollywood location was not our cup of tea but very handy to explore there and other areas as so close to red metro line. thanks.
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff are amazing! pub crawl was brilliant and such a great location.
Panama,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,only stayed for one night. it was good enough not to stay the whole day. it&amp;#39;s kinda packed. no elevator which sucked because i had a huge bag. breakfast was ok. 
India,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,"it was a good experience, good breakfast...they organise pub crawls, trips to hollywood etc...i will recommend it!!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"good hostel. positive aspects: good outdoors lounge area, good staff, good indoors lounge area upstairs, good security, good location in hollywood. negative aspects: poor breakfast; the mattress is not so comfortable (seems air-filled), the beds have a grid at the end, so tall people (i am 6.2 tall) have to sleep shrunken as they can&amp;#39;t leave their feet outside the bed."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, i felt safe, i had a locker with a powerpoint in it. friendly staff and excellent location"
India,MixedGroup,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,10,4,6,8,good atmosphere. however the staff was unfriendly and rude. not being so informative. butter in the kitchen ran out all the time. 
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,8,8,10,8,8,"everything about my stay was outstanding, but there water smells like metal"
Malaysia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"when we first got there, the street appeared quiet and we weren&amp;#39;t sure how safe the area was. once we walk up hollywood blvd to the chinese theatre, it&amp;#39;s all very lively. hostel had excellent security both at the main entrance and dorms -  lockers provided with plug points for secure charging - all you have to bring is a med-sized lock. everything was well thought-out. disappointing part: they decided not to run a free shuttle without telling us, even though they already had us listed down"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,6,10,8,10,"cleanliness was exceptional. staff always very helpful. really need to find room for a bar somewhere! overall, a pretty cool place"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,4,10,8,6,6,6,8,this hostel is right in the heart of hollywood (albeit not the nicest location) and is close to all the main attractions. rooms and kitchen were always clean. breakfast was pretty poor the first two mornings (just toast or diy pancakes) but we worked out on mornings 3 and 4 that you have to get there before 9am to get fruit and porridge. most of the staff were really nice and helpful. they have at least 3 fun and affordable activities each day. pretty expensive for output - but that&amp;#39;s hollywood!
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel experience i ever had
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,this hostel was one of my favourite hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in they have a lot of activities you can do during the day and at night and a very friendly team 
Uzbekistan,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,6,10,10,6,hostel is located in the heart of hollywood. very good atmosphere. but bed sheets and linens very not so clean...
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,8,10,10,10,really cool place! fun staff and friendly people
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"stayed for two nights in a 6 bed female dorm. the room was really nice, i had no issues with the accommodation. everything was clean and tidy, the lockers for your storage were a good size. location was awesome we could walk to most attractions or it was only a short bus trip away. staff were wonderful, very helpful. i would stay there again no worries at all. "
Yemen,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,6,10,10,my first time staying in a hostel. i was amazed by how this hostel organized. some of the stuff is not very nice but some of them are awesome. i loved the activities and the rides they offer.
SouthAfrica,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"my overall experience at the hostel has been positive. liked the group hostel activities, which added to the positive experience. the fact that there was no male only dorm rooms were a bit strange, and would have preferred it to the mixed dorm. beds were nice and firm, with clean linen, however i would recommend that it be fastened more to the walls, as the top bunk was unsteady (would shake) if bottom person moves even slightly."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stay in business and keep up the good work!
England,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel! staff are super friendly! the tours they offer are great! really good areas to chill inside and out. if your room isn't ready yet or you have to check out earlier than you plan on leaving la  then you can go and nap in the upstairs lounge where there are showers tvs etc. breakfast is also so nice - good range to choose from ! definitely head to down town at night if you're over 21! 
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed one night. roommates were respectful of rest times. i wasn&amp;#39;t use to sounds of people around me and woke up startled once.  after i got the free wifi to stream sleep music over my iphone i didn&amp;#39;t wake up startled again. perfectly wonderful staff and fellow travelers.  loved the breakfast with fresh fruit.  juice machine didn&amp;#39;t work, but overall everything was as expected.    i see why it wins awards!  "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i have no words to describe the awesomeness of this place. i think i even felt like home. definitely at a whole other level 💯👌🏼
England,Female,18-24,8.6,6,8,8,10,10,10,8,talented and helpful staff! amazing free breakfast. handy check out day luggage storage. you'll meet some fab new friends and have loads of fun. just make sure you budget for it and keep your wits about you round town. fab hostel 8/10.
AmericanSamoa,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect place, and i&amp;#39;ve usually always stayed in hotels! best way to meet new people and make new friends! loved it"
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"had an amazing stay here, met some great friends &amp; even though i was in la to catch up with my own friends and had planned on being out of the hostel a lot, i ended up having such a good time with people in the hostel &amp; made some of the best memories just chilling outside in the garden area. staff are super friendly, helpful &amp; get really involved with the guests. i would say, however, compared to so many other hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in.... this really is quite expensive. totally worth it though. "
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,8,more disappointed with hollywood itself than the hostel
England,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great hostel day trips, very spacious rooms , friendly staff and perfect location. would highly recommend "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,great lay out with the patio area being at the entrance. very inviting atmosphere
Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,totally worth it! i&amp;#39;ve met the best people on my californian trip so far and i recommend to anyone to visit this place. the front porch with the sofas are one of the best assets that this hostel can offer and you can have a good time with your new friends until early in the morning. the staff people were very kind and generous. i&amp;#39;ve stayed for 4 nights and i would have probably gone for one more if i knew. 
Pakistan,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"the staff was amazing, location was perfect, secure &amp; affordable. "
Italy,Male,41+,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"good:  . excellent location  . easy transportation from lax airport (by taking the lax2hw shuttle)  . well planned beds with a good privacy  . clean  . helpful staff  . good breakfast  . daily activities for guests    bad:  . small kitchen, always crowd for the breakfast  . small front patio, and always full for smokers (a hell!)  . very small lockers, do not fit even a small backpack    about the city of los angeles/hollywood:  . drugs are legalized there. drug smokers are everywhere! is the decadence/chao"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,great vibes and awesome location. they always have something to do if you've got nothing planned.
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic stay. very friendly staff and lots to do. really enjoyed the free comedy night. rooms are tidy and beds are comfortable.
Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,first time in la and the experience at this hostel was incredible. great facility being run by great people. i would one 100% recommend it. i know i&amp;#39;ll be coming back the next time i&amp;#39;m in la
Guatemala,Male,31-40,8,6,10,6,8,10,8,8,"i just stayed one night and it was a monday night so it was very quiet, but is easy to meet people. "
Scotland,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,6,8,staff were great. room mates not so much. nothing the hostel can do about that though. 
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,6,8,10,4,8,"decent hostel. not the best, not the worst.    pros:   -hearty american breakfast provided (i made a lot of pancakes)  -clean rooms  -centrally located: a short walk to the metro or bus and an easy uber ride to lacma, griffith observatory and santa monica.     cons:  - being in the middle of hollywood's business area, it's seedy, grimy and tacky. not a cool place to hang. dead at night.  -the vibe of the guests wasn't great. the people i met weren't fun or interesting. this was a key low point."
China,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice hostel 
England,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,4,8,"decent hostel but not much atmosphere, the evening meal and walking tour were cancelled while i was there and the friday night bar crawl started an hour late by which time jet lag had caught up with me.  no bar at the hostel.  beds are comfortable and give you some privacy."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"although i checked in almost midnight, front desk was accommodating. location is excellent. just few walks and you're at the beginning of the walk of fame.  highly recommend "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i normally stay at another hostel when i&amp;#39;m in la but it was booked out so i booked this one. stayed in a 6 bed female dorm with ensuite for 1 night and had a very pleasant stay!    everything was super clean, staff were friendly and it was in such a central location. shame i could not stay for longer...would definitely come back again!    "
England,Male,31-40,6.6,4,8,6,6,8,6,8,my main complaint about this hostel is the lack of storage space in the rooms. i was in a 6 bed shared dorm and there was nowhere to store my clothes. the room felt crampt too and in my opinion should have only had four beds in it. the outdoor space was nice and the bar area was fun. the staff are very friendly and helpful too. as for the location if you want to be in hollywood it&amp;#39;s perfect. i just didn&amp;#39;t like hollywood. 
Peru,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"usa hostel was a really good choice for me as it was located in a great spot right in hollywood. there were lots of cool places to go visit and eat nearby.  atmosphere was also great, i went prior to coachella and there were lots of people going there too. also the rest of travellers and staff were really cool people and i ended up making some cool friends in there.    if i were to go to los angeles again, i&amp;#39;d definitely go back to this hostel."
Norway,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel!
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,2,10,10,4,8,8,6,i had a private room that was really small for what i paid for...which was almost usd400 for about 3 nights...didn&amp;#39;t have much going on during the day and the kitchen was always a mess and stunk really bad due to people cooking and burning their food.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"my stay was great. very clean and hospitable hostel. central location to everything in hollywood. only improvement could be the late checkout, i paid the extra fee for a late checkout only to find that it's  only an extra half an hour past the checkout time!"
France,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,the location is awesome. approximately 5 minutes from the main place in hollywood.  the breakfast is good for me because we can make fresh crepes.  the personal is nice but don&amp;#39;t provide a lot of informations about what we can do in los angeles .. it&amp;#39;s a shame  the hostel organize severals events during the week and i appreciated it. 
Philippines,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i would definitely stay here again.  10/10
USA,Male,41+,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,a good place to stay
India,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,the place was great.  staff were very friendly.  rooms were clean too.. except that sometimes the people staying make it a bit messy with bags and clothes lying around.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,an amazing place to stay would recommend it to anyone :)
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hostel had lots of activities (both day and night) to encourage people to interact and meet other travellers. there were two nice places to relax in the hostel - the lounge and  the outdoor area.  the juice at breakfast was sensational. :)  on check in you are given a really detailed map of the area including instructions on how to get to all of las major attractions.  laura at reception was super helpful, even with things that she didn&amp;#39;t need to be - like what insurance to get for our hire car.  "
SouthAfrica,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,absolutely loved this hostel. prime location near hollywood boulevard. the staff were amazing and very friendly and outgoing. would definitely recommend

Mexico,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this place apart from being technically at very high stardards, really stroke me as the best experience in my life as a whole. from the beginning of my stay till the end i made it to know amazing people there including the staff who became an essential part of the greatest adventure in california. not to mention all these amenities offered by the hostel itself that bring you everything you need to jump right into the action from your arrival and all during your stay. totally recommended. "
Portugal,Male,25-30,8,4,10,8,8,8,8,10,"thats all good but the shower is bad, no pressure... and the breakfast was not so good but the hostel is really good"

Colombia,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,my only complain is that one night some girls made a lot of noise about 3 am. it is a nice place.
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,6,10,security measures are a hassle. the mood isn&amp;#39;t fun-loving.
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great! no complaints.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"there should be an ice machine somewhere, or a freezer where we could get ice.   roommate courtesies should be pointed out more upon check in.  very helpful and responsive staff  "
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,location was the best part of this place. the patio common area was a nice touch. the private room is small (the bed is wall to wall) just so you know. shampoo/conditioner is provided which is good and also the laundry is convenient. 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"good hostel, good location, good people. "
Hungary,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great services; they organize pub crawls, tours in hollywood / beverly hills and provide a van to some locations (beach, six flags magis mountain)."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay. can&amp;#39;t fault them for anything. staff were great, really helpful and socialable. tours were perfect!!! the place was well run, clean and secure. everything was perfect "
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a brilliant hostel with awesome fun staff, you meet a good crowd here, it's easy to get to from the metro and within walking distance of the sights in hollywood, the hostel is great , just hollywood isn't so special and seems to be very dodgy at night. brilliant hostel though"
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"great place - but corporate and no real backpacker feel as it&amp;#39;s basically just a cheap hotel now, but the staff make up for it with friendly service, also the breakfast is great and the tours and activities they organise are fun. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the hostels location is just south the hollywood. easy to get around. they also offer good programs like stand-up comedy.   the room was clean. only disappointment was that i forgot my passport in the room,  but the hostel did not write an email even with this important docoument. i looked at my next destination for a whole evening for it. however, they sent it to me for free which was very nice."
Indonesia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"simply the best hostel i ever stayed,   i like everything about it! "
England,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,10,6,6,10,"some of the staff were cool, a lad from england-newcastle/sunderland, the woman manager, maria &amp; the mexican guy &amp; 2 lads from england, surrey - they were sound. great location! "
Netherlands,Female,41+,8.3,8,10,8,10,8,6,8,"great stay, very handy location, beside hollywood boulevard and close to the metro.  i joined the hostel&amp;#39;s free walk to the canyon, which was the highlight of my stay.  breakfast is very good and what a clever idea to have a socket for charging inside each locker.  i never saw that before.  only downside (not the hostel&amp;#39;s fault) were my roommates, who were very inconsiderate.  insane amount of luggage constantly occupying all floor space, lights on until 2 a.m. and bathroom never avalailable...."
England,Male,41+,8,4,10,10,6,8,8,10,its a real shame that you do not have yogurts for breakfast anymore as i was really looking forward to that. so i must say after staying there 3 times now the breakfast was a bit of a let down.
Scotland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, great atmosphere, loads of organised trips and activities, great night outs, great wifi, laundry &amp; staff were friendly and helpful and if i&amp;#39;m back in hollywood i would definitely stay here again. "
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"bunk is comfortable with an outlet, light and cover. location was central for where i was going (west hollywood, franklin village, griffin park, echo park, north hollywood, silver lake were all short lyft rides away). it was nice to have a bathroom in the dorm room. "
Taiwan,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff are so helpful that solo traveler like me finds the quality so important and valuable! the hostel maybe not in the best area that would make you totally safe but still just 30 secs walk to the walk of fame and a few blocks away from chinese theater!   
Albania,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,8,10,great hostel!!!
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my 3rd stay. will always come back when i&amp;#39;m in la. safe, clean, great people, best beds of any hostel i&amp;#39;ve stated in because of privacy. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i need to say if you want hostel near everything and a staff that will help you in whatever way they can then stay here you won&amp;#39;t be sorry. the people you will meet there will make the hostel so much better i met so many great people there. when i go back to hollywood i will stay there again.
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.4,4,10,8,6,8,8,8,"clean room  secure  nice outdoor area, events organised by hostel  located between two train stations 10 min walk     only downside is price "
Denmark,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,if you're young and want to have fun/party/ meet people from all over the world you won't be disappointed
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever!!!    so much activities and staff are super friendly and helpful. clean clean clean! free breakfast is decent too. super secure
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had never stayed in a hostel in the us before...it's not glamorous, but the place is nice, it's clean, there's a communal kitchen, and it's right in downtown la near taxi, metro, and buses. i stayed in a private room, beds were totally fine and the place was clean. very happy."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,why was the sign tour like 7$ too much?
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very good and clean hostel, great staff, and the limo party they have is really awesome. highly recommended."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,the people were awesome. la in general was very difficult to get around.
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a really great hostel. the staff were amazing - especially laura and louie - who would do anything to help with such minimal fuss. the activities they put on were great and made my time at the hostel so enjoyable. free breakfast, free wifi, what more could e ask for for? definitely the best hostel i have stayed at in the usa. "
USA,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,10,6,6,10,"a very good hostel. clean, great beds with individual lamps and outlets. decent breakfast."
England,Couple,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,"arrived at 1:20am, was checked in promptly but when we got to our room we couldn't find our beds because people had put all there stuff on them which was annoying. free breakfast was a nice touch. great location and really friendly and helpful staff! you get lockers for your things and reception control who enters based on if they have a key which is good. "
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,"the rationale for the atmosphere rating is that the room was pretty quiet from about 11:00 pm until about 2:00 am on the night of my stay (a wednesday), until someone started blasting music directly outside our windows. the music lasted at least 20-30 minutes, and even after closing the windows we weren't insulated from the noise. i would expect such an incident on a weekend night, but was surprised it happened on a weekday and that the room was so poorly insulated."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"this hostel was fine - clean and functional, but nothing special."
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel with a super cheap bar and the best comedy night ever! i have been to paid comedy events and didn't laugh as hard as i did at their free comedy night!
Argentina,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,6,10,8,8,"the kitchen to have breakfast it's a bit small so it can be crowded during morning and difficult to find a place to seat.   the location it's very good but that hollywood area it's not so nice, regardless of this i've been there twice and it's very easy to go to different places en la from there.   last time the shower didn't work very well and it ended up full of water with soap and someone's hair, so  i was not able to take a shower because of this but first hour someone was cleaning."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the facilities, being a hostel, we're excellent. the culture and community was amazing."
England,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great hostel, very clean and good facilities. only shame was that there wasn't many people involved in the activities!"
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,6,10,"i wasn’t hit with a the usual high energy/diversity found in hostels. free comedy show upstairs was hilarious; bonus for $1 beers &amp; $2 shots. friendly staff though not too talkative. hands down the cleanest hostel i've ever stayed in. breakfast was below continental, but there was free pancake batter. location is as expected, but i’d recommend staying closer to the beach. overall an average stay, not too much character or depth to the hostel – ironically a perfect representation of hollywood."
Germany,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,see below
Scotland,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,6,10,"overall, a good hostel, we did not like the location as much. found it hard to get around if you did not have a car. rooms are clean but not the nicest. nothing serious to complain about but would most likely recommend a hostel nearer the things we had planned to do. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel in l.a.!!!
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,8,6,8,8,"great location right off the strip. walked to the runyon canyon, and did nice hike. the breakfast was pancakes, toast, oranges and bananas. rooms are cleaned every morning."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"staff are very friendly and knowledgable. the location is perfect, close to the main attractions. the price was a little high for a dorm style room. however, its value for money with the free breakfast and free activities/shuttle provided. the facilities were excellent, especially the lounge room, outside area and super fast wi fi!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,10,8,8,"great hostel, the staff there made it very comfortable and were willing to help as much as they could"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel, great location just off hollywood blvd. they run daily and nightly activities so it's easy to socialize. facilities are always clean and staff are really helpful. already planning my trip back here. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,6,10,8,10,"absolutely lovely staff (jamie in particular, personally helping me multiple times), great location, super clean, never seemed to have enough towels for the amount of people, we had to share one for our time there. breakfast is super good (as its free) and offers fresh fruit and other lovely things."
England,Female,25-30,4.9,6,8,4,4,2,4,6,staff are rude especially volunteers and guy running the bar crawl. volunteers did not know how to clean rooms.
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,10,6,8,8,the hostel was in a really central location between two metro stations and a short stroll to chinese theatre. the hostel was as a hostel normally is- with a couple of added bonuses- the breakfast was a great touch and lots of charging facilities. the lockers provided added room security and it seemed to have something for everyone. slight negatives would be that the towels and linen looked far from clean i.e pretty stained from prior use and some staff members far from warm upon arrival.
Norway,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,loved it. very friendly visitors and staff. liked the pancakes a lot 8)
England,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,one of the best hostels i've stayed at.the location is fantastic and the staff were friendly and helpful.the free breakfast and coffee and tea were also great bonuses.and the free wifi worked pretty well.  this is how a hostel should be run.
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,6,10,10,6,"good location in hollywood. they offer nice programs - such as free shuttle to six flags park , pub crawling and comedy show. the breakfast is average, it&amp;#39;s totally up to you how well you cook your pancake by yourself xd "
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,i'm so happy i chose to stay at this hostel. the location was perfect and the staff were amazing! sooo helpful and friendly which was really reassuring as i'd travelled 13 hours from the uk to stay in la. the other travellers were amazing and i was so grateful to be able to meet some of them and i've definitely made a few friends for life. i cannot fault this hostel and i would 110% stay here again!
Philippines,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,its the best hostel ever!good value for money
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,"everything was good, expect that the kitchen is very small."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was all good.mostly the hostel employees was awesome and very helpful.thank you so much for everything.hope see you guys soon again miss you already ;) thanks again
England,Female,18-24,7.7,6,10,6,6,8,8,10,"friendly staff, the hostel run activities are a good way to meet people. "
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,"great time there, wish my room didn't smell the way it did but hey i can't control people feet. other than that staff real friendly have the place running well with activities to take part in."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,8,10,10,"really enjoyed my stay, cheers!"
Switzerland,Female,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,6,6,6,8,for that price i was expecting more. we had to wash the dishes after breakfast. and there was only toast and some fruits. no cheese or something like that. i was quite disappointed with the breakfast. and the kitchen is too small for all the guest. but the staff is friendly and it was great that every room has its own bathroom. so you almost never have to wait.
Syria,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,6,10,all is good but only the atmosphere needs little shake up i think  
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really incredible stay. the woman at the desk, jamie, was absolutely wonderful! so helpful, kind and understanding!  the whole atmosphere of the place was really friendly, they continually helped me even after i had checked out.   i couldn't be more grateful to everyone that worked there."
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,super friendly staff &amp; great location in hollywood. i mistakenly thought this hostel is near the amtrak station but the $80 taxi ride from the airport  was worth it to get to see hollywood.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good location, right next to hollywood blvd.     only stayed one night but appeared to be clean and secure."

India,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,good hostel in the heart of hollywood!
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"great location, extra friendly and helpful staff. they put on a lot of activities during the day and nigh - a great atmosphere within the hostel. would 100% recommend to anyone coming to la or hollywood"
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was great! they do have top notch security, thus anybody just can't stumble in. i really had a good time!"
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was one of the best hostels i have ever stayed in. clean, great staff, great location, tons of activities provided.   thank you!"

Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, helpful staff, awesome outdoor patio spot."
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"i've stayed here quite a few times, but i am unsure whether i will do so again in the near future. the last couple times i have found things got pretty noisy during what we're supposed to be their ""quiet hours.""   still, apart from that i had a very good time, and would recommend them in a heartbeat...along with a very good pair of earplugs."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"solid facilities, great location, glad i picked it."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,everithing was very clean. the hostel staff was amazing friendly and helpful with everything.  the activities they offer are nice to meet new people and do/see great suff.

Turkey,MixedGroup,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,it is a little bit expensive for a hostel but everything other than price was really good (except some noisy roommates :))
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"very good hostel, good atmosphere and night life. facilities are decent. the only problem was the bunks are low and the guy above me masterbated which at 430 am is weird. "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"great staff, great activities every day. heaps of solo travelers as well so easy to meet people "

USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay. perfect location and 99% of the travelers there are pretty cool.
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,the staff make this hostel. special mention to michael for making the perfect batch of popcorn. also a shout out to ethan and pete for entertaining us at breakfast 
Switzerland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i recommend this hostel!! it's one of the cleanest hostels i was ever been.   the customers are very friendly and the location was perfect. we enjoyed our trip in la.   thanks very much!
Italy,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,10,10,8,6,"great location, friendly staff. nice lounge area and facilities. slightly letdown by the noise during my stay, some of the beds are squeaky and the shower had no pressure. overall great value though!"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,great facilities and very comfortable rooms. they had great events on including bbq's and tours. i did the hollywood sign walking tour which was very cheap and a great way to meet new people. everything was well organized and the staff were very helpful. i had a great time here and i would love to stay here again. would highly recommend! 
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is the perfect place for la location, areas to chill outside, and the staff couldn't be more helpful, gave us directions and maps and advice even for our route to the next hostel, thank you so much"
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"well simply a great hostel, they really know what they are doing....great atmosphere, they know how to entertain their guess and thy  offer new and different things every day great for solo travelers or groups"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,great hostel. very informative and helpful. all the staff were accomondating and made an effort to assist you. if only you could choose your roommates. there is no age restrictions so if your sharing with older people they will be up at the crack of dawn and wake you up! staying on the weekend there is a fair bit of noise in the neighbourhood so make sure you have your earplugs. i thought it was a very well run hostel and would stay again.
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel atmosphere easy to meet other backpackers. knowledgeable and friendly staff. good location and hostel activities are superb. would definitely stay again.
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,"had a great time here, there are plenty of activities run by the hostel to get involved in. very clean and very safe! "
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,"i have stayed at this hostel before and had no issues and this is why i decided to stay again. however this time, in our bathroom someone blocked up our toliet. for 3 days none of cleaners did anything about it, i know one of the girls said something about it and nothing was done and then i went down and asked if i could use a toliet cause ours is broken and they showed me to another toliet but did nothing about ours. it started to smell."
China,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,4,10,10,6,40刀一晚的价格对于床位费是太贵了。不过好在附加的东西比较多，比如每天都有一些免费的活动，比如免费去海边等，偶尔免费的午餐晚餐，虽然比较简陋但是毕竟是免费提供。位置靠中国剧院比较远，但是去各处都交通方便。不过有件事情必须提醒，一定要确认入住人及预订渠道。我的朋友在booking上预订的，离店后被booking以未入住为由收取一晚的费用。我认为这是店员的失职。
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i can't praise this hostel enough, it is hands down the best hostel i have stayed in the usa. every member of staff i dealt with were both so friendly and professional. in addition the facilities were first class - whoever thought to have plug sockets in each individual locker is an absolute genius!"
Netherlands,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"amazing people, staff, very nice laid-back vibe, great location, had an amazing time!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,8,10,10,10,"really a nice place to spend a couple of fun days in hollywood. almost every day another atrraction like hiking tours, comedy club or pub crawls were on offer. bbq's and beer pong plays took place as well in the nice frontyard of the hostel.  you can just sit there from breakfast time until the middle of the night and get to know new friendly people from all over the world. the staff is very nice and helpful and the atmosphere is really good. i was totally happy there!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"staff was wonderful!  many travelers i have read online, speak about the lack of a/c or fans, but if you're fortunate to be next to a window..why complain? i enjoyed the free bbqs and the non-expensive events that the hostel puts together.  the beverage vending machine doesn't give back change, the common room with the tvs is great, however, both tvs are set to same channel so you can't watch different programs.  overall i had a great time with usa-hostels hollywood!"
England,Female,31-40,8.9,10,8,8,8,8,10,10,"good location, and good opportunities to do things with the hostel which was great."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"really really great hostel!  clean, great breakfast included, the staff were very friendly and helpful, easy to do anything and everything here. and in the best location in the middle of hollywood!"
England,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,"was greeted with a chaotic reception desk followed by a barrage of unusually stringent policies and rules. reception also not particularly helpful with advice/insight into the city. other than that, a decent short stay."
England,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"free, bbq,free ride to beach, free comedy night, free returns to six flags,, more expensive than other hostels,but you get it all back and more.good atmosphere on front lounge area, overal great experience."
Scotland,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,fantastic hostel. centrally located. met some amazing folks here. very much a social/party hostel with good activities and cool staff too. 
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,10,6,8,8,"well organized, clean. a little on the expensive side, but this is hollywood. plenty of places to mingle with other visitors, which i did. had a great time, thanks!"
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,8,4,8,6,we felt overall the hostel was nice although the staff weren't particularly friendly. there was only one nice guy but he had just started and the other staff were rolling their eyes and very impatient with him when he asked for help. didn't create a great atmosphere for us as guests.
Turkey,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"it has a great location right next to the hollywood blvd. it looks pretty nice from the outside and patio as well as the inside of the building. the beds have sockets, which is a great service, and the bathrooms were pretty clean. not many hostels have events, but the hostel has several events everyday, some of which requires some payment if not much."
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"staff was amazing. atmosphere was fantastic, lots of people with cool vibes. the only suggestion i would make is to setup a/c in the rooms, it was incredibly hot and you have to struggle to get a decent sleep."
Ireland,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"comfortable beds,with a good amount of privacy when sleeping/reading.location excellent,decent breakfast."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,dope hostel. helpful staff and always activities going on. met some amazing people here
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my 4th stay here.it could easily serve as a model or template of what a hostel should be.the location is very convenient , just off hollywood boulevard and the centre of the action in l.a. the staff are friendly, helpful and professional.the dorms are exceptionally well designed , with power points, reading lights and privacy screens at each bed and power points inside the large lockers.big front patio with lots of seating to relax outside in the reliably balmy l.a. weather"
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"i've stayed in over a dozen hostels now and i'd say this one is a solid b+.  great hostel to meet travelers as there's a front porch area with couches and there's a bar open at night on the 2nd floor (although i wish someone told me this...i didn't figure this out until my last night lol)   free towels, easy check-in. the staff was a little ""meh"" honestly. they were friendly but just like i said...""meh"".  the rooms are hot, the other reviewers are not wrong here. rooms are spacious though!"
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly, helpful staff, very clean rooms and spotlessly clean ensuites. excellent wifi and access to power supplies which these days is a necessity, not a bonus! activities and shuttles organised for you....and a very generous breakfast included in the price. highly recommend!"
England,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,8,6,fun hostel!
USA,Male,31-40,8,6,8,8,8,10,6,10,staff were excellent and the place was very clean. my only complaint is the sound of delivery trucks next door waking me up every morning at 4 or 5.
Mexico,Male,25-30,6.3,2,10,10,4,4,6,8,"the good: breakfast was great   the bad: staff is not a problem solver; some of them aren’t friendly at all. check in time is very late 2:00 pm and check out time very early. 10 am. other hostels check out times is 11 a.m. or 12p.m. and check ins at 1:00  the worst: no air con, fans didn't do anything. sleeping here is impossible because rooms are ridiculously hot.  the best: location  conclusion: overpriced. i will never go back there."
China,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,love this hostel but not la
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"i stayed here for a week and i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised. a lot of people complaining about no ac. yes it was hot but not that bad. the staff were great - some unfair and unprofessional at times but otherwise very helpful. beds were comfortable, no issues with wifi, but i knew a few people who did. security is tight but not during the day, homeless able to enter. price a little high for a hostel but i can't complain as i have met some amazing people and would 100% return here"
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8,8,10,6,8,8,10,6,"good hostel, great atmosphere!! easy to meet new people. rooms were good, although ac couldn't hurt (hot!). hollywood isn't that interesting, but it's a safe area. bathrooms were a bit dirty. breakfast was awesome!!"
Spain,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel. clean toilets, confortable beds, corteous staff."
Sweden,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,really helpful and nice staff. close to everything in hollywood and they arrange trips and tours with good value for money.
Scotland,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,8,10,enjoyed my stay at this hostel. the security was excellent and it was maybe the cleanest hostel i have ever been in ! would highly recommend to anyone coming to la to stay here

Scotland,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,really good hostel just off hollywood blvd. helpful staff. too hot in the rooms with no air con.

England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"easy to meet people here and plenty of activities provided inc a few all you can eat bbqs. a good base location wise, right i the centre of hollywood. staff all pretty friendly and common areas are good places to chill out or hang out and party."
China,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a well managed hostel, nothing negative about it to say, please keep up the good reputation. good job to you!"
Germany,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,just one word.. wow!!!!
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,probably the best hostel in la. i have no complaints. i would stay here again.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,hostel was pretty cool. good security measures. no air con in most rooms kinda sucked :-( free breakfast was a bonus :-) comedy night was super awkward. the tours are good for if you don't know how to get there yourself.
England,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"no air con, fans didn't do anything so it was ridiculously hot, slept on top of sheets."
France,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"i had a great stay at usa hostel hollywood, staff was friendly and helpful!  lot of activities every day and very good location!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,the staff were very friendly and seemed to really do their utmost to ensure the guests (including myself) were situated with their visit in la. the hostel was very clean; the bathroom layout was great since the shower was set in another room. the amenities had advantages since there were convenient resources for accessing and storing snacks and the provision of lots of power outlets was very helpful. the security was also great with the multiple lock systems in place. i'd stay again if i return.
Colombia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,great service. staff were very helpful and gave lots of advices about things to do in the city.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff who spoke perfect english with good knowledge of the area! good location, and atmosphere. hostel offers plenty of activities both at night and during the day! great place to meet people so would recommend for those travelling alone! "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect, no problems, clean. very hip and plenty of fun common areas. would recommend!"
Germany,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,the daily activities are well organised and a great opportunity to get to know new people. the location is super close to the walk of fame and some nice bars/restaurants
Thailand,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,10,8,8,good location. many activities. friendly staff.
Scotland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved our stay here, great location and lots to do with the hostel or on our own, staff were great. only downside was the dorms got really warm but it is la in summertime :)"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"thanks so much for making my la stay amazing! all the activities organised by the hostel were excellent, shown around by people who really knew the area and knew their stuff. the bar crawl was a particular highlight! really appreciated being able to use the hostel facilities the day of check out - check out is 10am but my flight wasn't until later on that evening. staff were all so friendly and super helpful at all times. couldn't have asked for anything more! :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome staff!
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,"i liked that i was able to use the kitchen and lounge after i'd checked out and was waiting for my shuttle. the breakfast was also really good. i wasn't a fan of hollywood blvd that much as there wasn't much for me to do other than souvenir shop (lots of bars but i'm underage). tours were good fun, always ran in the middle of the day for some reason (very hot).   overs all i'm glad i stayed here and would stay again if i was over 21 and in a group."
NewZealand,Female,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good place to meet other travellers,  lots of activities organised by the hostel,  very helpful staff"
India,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is located in the middle of hollywood street .. the staff are most helpful and amazing . love the daily tour they schedule , it allows one to build and know your room mates and fellow people.. "
Brazil,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,6,6,6,8,6,the breakast ia terrible! no air condition. summer day and/or night in this hostel is impossible.
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the loveliest thing about this hostel is that the staff all seem to be travellers themselves, so it adds an extra homely element. the beds all have 'privacy compartments' with a panel containing plugs and a shelf. when you're sharing rooms this small feature is very welcomed. you can really relax. breakfast is fresh and varied, maybe the best of all la hostels and i stayed in four while in la."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"brilliant staff, always happy to help with any query (i had a lot)."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,8,the location and the hostel itself was great. it was annoying to show the card every time but it ensured only people who were staying there to enter the building. i just wish the rooms had air conditioning as the fan on the roof was not enough to keep the room cool during the hot summer month of july/august and the shower did not have a warm setting. my room had only a hot or cold setting.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a great hostel, i travelled to many different hostels in america this summer and this hostel was the best i stayed in. the room was spacious and clean. i loved the design of the beds having a metal surrounding that created almost a den for you and you could charge your belongings. this hostel offered great activities for free or a small charge. i would highly recommend this hostel."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,i loved the sign up tour oportunities and shuttles to go and the bbq during my stay! the only thing that i didnt like was that the fan in the room turned off when we turned the lights off so it was very uncomfortable to sleep...i wish the roo s has ac!!!
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,8,6,6,6,checkout at 10am is too early. needs to be changed to 11am. staff weren't always friendly.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved my stay at usa hostels hollywood! the facilities were great, the atmosphere was great and there were plenty of activities on offer. the rooms had their own bathroom (which were cleaned very thoroughly) and lockers were a suitable size to put valuables in. the staff were friendly and professional!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"i had a fantastic stay. the staff were lovely, as we're all the guests. the room was clean and the bed was comfortable."
Scotland,Male,25-30,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"mote shower and toilet facilities would be good, especially at this price."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"good hostel but not for the people (not staff) i mean, people in the hostel are likely to enjoy parties and it is fine with me. it is their business but after the party, they took shower at 1 am or noon... everything is really great. place, kind staff, facilities.. but if you want stay in a tranquil place or a quiet hostel, i do not want to recommend this hostel. that is th only deficit this hostel has."
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,i like to much this hostel!
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,this hostel had a very good location and had very clean and well designed rooms with loads of charging points and private bunk beds. we enjoyed our stay here!
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,10,10,2,6,6,10,"fantastic location!! only bad thing about this hostel is lack of toilets!! what a joke, had to wait for about an hour due to everyone showering. went to try and use the 3 only other communal toilets all taken for the whole time. apart from this it was a fantastic hostel."
Wales,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,"i didn't like the atmosphere, which in fairness was mainly dictated by the guests staying at the time, but could have been better with more social events."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,this hostel is great value for money situated about 45 minutes outside of the national park.    there is a sauna and spa which is perfect after a days hiking. the home made food and bar was also spot on!    altogether a great hostel and great value for money.
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"lockers could have been bigger, and not all rooms had aircon. other than that it was great"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"as a single traveller this place allowed for full participation in meals, tours, meeting people, being safe! this place was amazing! the dude overnight was amazing, let me in when my shuttle dropped me off at 3am, checked me in and gave me everything i needed. the security door process is awesome. felt super secure. plenty of food places around and super central to all the fun! would certainly recommend to everyone! thanks guys!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,"a decent hostel with friendly staff and good facilities. if you're looking to go to hollywood it's relatively close, however the area immediately surrounding the hostel is quite trashy."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,6,10,10,8,8,10,great location and great outdoor area.
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,:-) it is just awesome.
China,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"awesome hostel in hollywood area. everything are great except that you have to be checked out by 10 am, which is too early for most of us."
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,6,6,10,8,8,"lack of air on made the room unbearable to sleep in, worst night sleep in any hostel j have stayed in. homeless in street and outside bedroom was bothersome"
England,Female,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really wish i stayed there for longer, great place both staff and other residents friendly and fun"
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,very good location. the hostel offers plenty of free tours and cheap tours for us. most of the staffs are very sociable and friendly.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,great! best hostel i've ever stayed in.
NewZealand,Female,41+,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,8,"breakfast choices were good, steady supply of fruit and milk. layout cramped at peak hour. a more  user friendly system for doing dishes to  avoid waiting in a line because with checkout time being at 10 am i was really rushing and waiting 10 min to do my dishes made it stressful as i was told in no uncertain terms i'd be charged another  $10 if i was late checking out. lots of travelers arrive late at night and 10 am is too earlier to checkout. every other hostel  has 11 am  checkout ."
SriLanka,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,some staff were not friendly at all.
Singapore,Female,18-24,6,6,6,8,6,4,4,8,"although the location was good, the general atmosphere of the place was undesirable for me. when i first entered the hostel, the smell of weed and alcohol immediately hit me in the face. i disliked that. that was why i shifted out after the 1st night. although some of the staff was friendly, there were a few of them (one particular male staff) who saw my friends and i struggling with our suitcases but did not bother to assist us with them when we had to move them up/down to our rooms."
Singapore,Female,18-24,3.7,4,4,2,6,6,2,2,there are too many people smoking weed and partying within or just outside the building. the fpushing system is weak as it is not able to flush a lot of things.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,great stay! good atmosphere and a lot of activities going on if you wish to par-take.   clean hostel with good vibes!
Canada,Male,25-30,8,6,6,10,10,6,8,10,great location. decent price. decent facilities. security needs a bit of work
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"this was the first hostel i stayed at on my trip around california, and made such a good impression that i stayed at other usa hostels in san francisco and san diego. great place, great atmosphere and activities, helpful and friendly staff. i felt safe and welcome and had a awesome time here. highly recommended! "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the beds were the comfiest i've stayed in, the staff was helpful and i loved the make your own pancake breakfast station! the map provided with food and attraction ideas was very helpful and very  appreciated."
India,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wish the shower water is faster .. and more forceful.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,10,6,8,8,8,10,8,"a lot of fun awesome staff and people, great value for money!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"hostel staff were helpful, it was clean and comfortable and had different activities every night. good place to meet people. facilities were great. "
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,good location next to hollywood boulevard. no parking for the hostel but we managed to get an ok deal from the lot across the street as we paid for 4 days up front - be prepared to haggle though. the room was comfortable and had an en suite. wifi was good. would recommend if you're in la and on a budget.
China,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very clean, great staff.    though not located in a very safe neighborhood, the hostel itself makes travelers feel very safe staying there"
Wales,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay at this hostel. met loads of people. all staff i came across were all friendly and always cleaning the hostel. good facilities available (especially walking tours are good), brilliant location for hollywood/ beverly hills. will definitely be back next time i'm visiting la. "
Argentina,Male,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,8,10,10,8,"very good hostel. excellent cost/quality relationship. staff was super nice and helpful. bed clothing and towels were not 100% clean but nothing too serious. as regards security, the neighborhood maybe a little bit dangerous during nights and during the day i came across with several crazy people in the nearby area asking for money and being aggressive if you don't give them anything. except for that, the rest was really good."
Sweden,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"for the money you pay, this hostel is excellent. great free breakfast every morning with bread, oats and pancakes!  they also do daily tours that you can join to see the best of la during your visit."
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel in a great location. really cool staff that will help you to get arround.
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent!!!!! best hostel in la!
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,10,6,6,4,"the pros to this hostel are the cleanliness and security.    the negatives are the expensive price you pay for noisy dorm rooms.   the staff member that checked me out of the hostel booked my airport shuttle for a random day, despite chatting to me about where i was going that night in detail. i was waiting by the door with my bags for 50 minutes before asking what was happening. his incompetence meant a mad rush across hollywood, paying for an alternative shuttle and almost missing my flight."
Switzerland,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,2,10,10,10,"it's a very good hostel with a good atmosphere,but you've to share the bathroom with 7 other people. "
Argentina,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"i am not a fan of chain hostels, they feel a little bit impersonal and too much like a hotel, it's a bit difficult to make friends if you are traveling alone. that being said, it's in a fantastic location, facilities are great (best bed ever), breakfast is awesome and the whole hostel it's very clean and comfortable. "
Italy,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"if you just want a place to crash and are not a light sleeper then this is the hostel for you. i was in a room with 7 other girls, so sleeping could be hard. everyone has different schedules and you have to wait for your time to use the bathroom/shower. personally, my experience wasn't really bad. the first night was terrible because one of my roommates snored like a drunk truck driver--no offense. i guess it's up to luck if you're put in a room with nice, considerate people then you'll be fine."
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,10,4,"the hostel dorm room wasn't cleaned properly; i stayed for 5 nights and they never mentioned anything about changing sheets or getting a new towels. ( i packed my own towels.) the other other guests made the experience memorable and the breakfast was good (except for being rudely rushed out exactly at 10:30a.m.) the pancakes were a nice touch. the british staff member that lead the hike to the hollywood sign (matt, i believe) was really friendly and helpful. :-)"
England,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,4,10,"we was very please with your staff, any questions we gave them they had an answer, we real enjoyed staying at the hostel. only one question, over the pasted 20 years l have travelled the world staying always at hostels, because of the joy and fun when you meet over people full of information on there travels with information, but today with everyone has a moble phone they just stare at the mobile all the time even when they are eating there meals!! how sad is that!! no one talks to each other!!"
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, very helpful staff. i would definitely stay here again. the outdoor patio is great!"
Australia,Male,31-40,7.4,6,10,6,8,4,8,10,"when i arrived in the morning i was given the impression of 'what the fuk do you want?"" from the desk staff which wasnt the nicest way to start my stay. the other breakfast staff and guides for the rest of the trip where a little nicer though. also... the us postal service just outside our window unloading at 3am in the morning super loudly made it nigh impossible to get any sleep."
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,10,8,"it is a great hostel, well located, clean, the staff is good and they have lots of activities. the only problem is that it is the most expensive hostel in hollywood."
England,Couple,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,6,10,10,"great locations and facilities. perfect place to explore hollywood and they appeared to offer free transport to the coast which is essential as public transport can be tricky in la. the only downside was an incredibly rude asian american girl on the front desk. she wasn't rude to us, but was completely condescending to her colleague right in front of us and also to our friend who wanted to leave us a message at the front desk- which apparently is 'impossible'. apart from that great stay."
Singapore,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best place to stay at if you want a taste of hollywood. definitely going back again!
England,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,best in the us
England,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great! would stay here again 
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,great hostel
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really lovely staff, great location just off hollywood blvd. people from all over the world come here and you hear so many stories from different walks of life. great social atmosphere. brilliant for first timers to hostels!"
Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,plugs and privacy pannels were excellent. i strongly recommend the hostel tour to the hollywood sign. it was great. good place to stay if you want to see hollywood.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"top hostel, it's got everything you need and the staff are super friendly"
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of my best hostels!! staffs are helpfull and kind!! excellents activities!
Colombia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"top hostel in la from the ones i've been to. really modern and well kept, very clean, almost gives you a feeling of a hotel. met a lot of cool people there, made some good friends. highly recommend "
Mexico,Female,18-24,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,"it's a good hostel, have a lot of facilities wifi, dry hair, it's pretty clean and have many activities for explore the city. beds have a strange sheet made with plastic, it makes you sweat and the show (even when is clean) is miserable!! the location is not that good, hollywood is just full of homeless people."
Russia,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the facilities was adequate, and the security was rigorous -- you had to show your key every time to be buzzed in. there were 6 people in our room and an en suite bathroom and toilet. the turnover seemed high, with people moving in and out every night. i didn't take part in the activities, so i can't comment on that. this place is alright if you just need to crash for a couple of nights."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very social hostel--great common area to hang out and meet people. lots of events organized to get out and do things with people. bunks were great with outlets and a shelf. the bathrooms are in each room separately, which sometimes meant for waiting while somebody else was using--there were two other bathrooms that were useable though. overall a great experience."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very clean. attentive staff and plenty of them. facilities were excellent. a perfect place to base yourself in la. they had thought of everything.
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great customer service, excellent facilities, 30 seconds walk to hollywood blvd, comfy mattress and an amazing variety of things for the free breakfast, really couldn't fault it! would definitely recommend anyone to stay here!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,i've stayed with all 3 of the usa hostels and love them all. always very clean and great activities organised! will recommend for sure!
Italy,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"definitely a good hostel. good location, nice atmosphere. hollywood is maybe not the best place to stay in la, but if you want to stay there, visit this hostel."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very good hostel - goes the extra mile compared to a lot of hostels. daily activities ranging from walking tours to all you can eat bbqs. good atmosphere as well, location is good for hollywood, less than 10min walk to the metro.   one minor issue i found was that reception was always very busy and took a while to check in/get info etc as a result"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,10,6,6,8,"the hostel was nice and had everything i needed, it did lack personality due to its large size though."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,10,8,"right in the middle of hollywood. really cool outdoor space with lounges to chill, relax and drink. they had free comedy and dinners some nights too and offer daily activities and tours. perfect if you want to stay in hollywood."
Norway,Female,18-24,4,4,8,6,2,2,2,4,"this hostel was not what we expected at all. the staff were unprofessional and you feel like they don't want you there. no rules and it was noisy all day and all night long..   we booked this hostel because we had such a great stay at usa hostel in san francisco. well, this was a bad experience, especially when it's so expensive. ain't coming back!"
SouthAfrica,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,8,10,"really good hostel and just off the strip! everything was very clean, efficient and in working order. rooms were just a tad pricey but i enjoyed the extras like the comedy night and the bar hopping (not sure what i had to pay for though)"
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this is a great hostel. i travelled solo and stayed in this hostel - met loads of new people, friendly atmosphere, great day trips organised by the hostel e.g. six flags theme park, free breakfast! la is massive so location will always be an issue at some point if you want to see more than hollywood. would definitely stay here again."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,9/10 would bang again.
Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,was a good choice for a place to start. many friendly people. nice to check out hollywood. everything is nearby. even the subway. very friendly and helpful staff.
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,"really nice place, very clean with great facilities. quite expensive, might stop me from staying again, but great for a few nights."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,5.4,6,8,6,6,2,8,2,one of the most disgusting hostels i have stayed at. one of the staff members was stoned 24/7 and messed up several of my bookings i had made. my dorm room smelt. good facilities but they really need to clean up their act. would not recommend staying at this hostel. i won't be back. 
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,10,10,8,10,"the location is perfect if you want to be right at the walk of fame but otherwise this is not a very fancy or clean area. the hostel offers lots of free stuff (walking tours to hollywood sign, shuttle to the beach) but this is often first come, first served. still the breakfast was fantastic (hot chocolate and butter/chocolate/jam spreading was missing). i loved the cleanliness of the hostel. the room is as dirty as your room mates are. minus: no checking in before 11am even if room is ready."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,6,10,10,pretty cool hostel. very clean and organized. the atmosphere was lacking. people didn't seem like they wanted to meet anyone. staff were friendly but could have encouraged more hostel comraderie. perfect if you want to explore hollywood tourist attractions. 
Spain,Female,25-30,8.9,6,10,8,10,10,8,10,"very clean and safe. it's very well located, just near all the touristic places of hollywood and close to the subway. good facilities, and good staff... that said, i have to say it's expensive. more expensive than other hostels around it. you pay for what you get. if you are not in a very tight budget, i think it's worthy. the breakfast was nice in general, but other spreads apart from butter (for example, peanut butter) would have been nice. i really liked the raisins &amp; cinnamon point!"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"the location is perfect, right off hollywood boulevard, everything is in walking distance! very secure, friendly staff, great offers on tours, shuttles and pub crawls.... only thing that would be great is if the hostel had deals with the close by parking garages, fees are very high and almost doubled the cost of our stay..."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,honestly one of the best hostels ever!
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,quality back packers. everything you want is there. staff very helpful with transport and tourist attractions.
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,10,8,"some unwanted hairs on my bed but other than that, great place! breakfast was a dinky but you can't ask for much at $40 a night. great place!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,8,10,4,4,great location and great staff. but didn't like the atmosphere at all. would not come back because of that
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,10,8,"front desk staffs are really kind. i arrived in la in the morning after riding night bus. so i need to rinse my hair, and the staffs allow to wash myself before check-in. because of that, i spent nice time in la. beds in dormitory are nice. beds have wall not to be seen, and also have personal lights. the location is good to go hollywood and universial studio. but at night, it can be little dangerous because little far from crowded hollywood avenue."
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great hostel, great place to meet people from all over the world! the only thing is that american hostels are quite expensive and booking a hotel sometimes might be cheaper. however, i can only recommend it. they also offer a programme for the day, which is a great thing!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,really nice and new hostel. offer many activities for day and night.
Colombia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,the place is situated in the best location that you can find in los angeles only one block of the fame hall in hollywood. if you want to go from the airport you need to take the flyway shuttle for only 8 usd.
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"the location is right in hollywood, awesome except that the window of my room and bathroom peered onto a parking lot where bums would hangout.  my biggest qualm is the en-suite bathrooms, people leave it messy, you have to wait to use it if someone else is in there, and hurry if someone is waiting.  perfect for meeting people. the outdoor lounge creates a social environment and i was up until 5am both nights of my stay chatting with people from around the world.  an unforgettable, awesome time!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels hollywood. the facilities were excellent and i really loved that there was all-you-can-eat pasta the night i was there. i only stayed for one night and thought that was much easier than finding my own dinner. the location was close to hollywood boulevard but in general i felt a little unsafe in the whole area around, nothing to do with the hostel though. overall really enjoyed my stay and would recommend."
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,4,10,10,6,4,6,4,"i was given a sheet with a big yellow stain in the middle and although the staff member changed it he did so with a sour look on his face, as if it were my fault. the rest of the staff are all very rude and disinterested, save for a couple. one bathroom per 8 bed is very limited. the tours and activities that are offered are ridiculously overpriced as are the beds themselves. not a bad place overral but if you want friendlier staff and better value then look elsewhere. "
Chile,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"awesome hostel, totally recommended!"
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i would like to see more breakfast options such as more fruits, cereals with milk and frozen waffles."
England,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"cleaner than some hotels i've stayed in, and feels really spacious and bright. the staff are amazing and super friendly (minus one rude, miserable girl) big rooms, comfy beds, this hostel is great! close to walk of fame, oscars theatre, chinese theatre, hollywood blvd. the only negative is the small kitchen but that can't be helped. plus you can eat out on the patio if you can't get a seat inside. hike to runyan canyon is well worth it the views are stunning! would 100% recommend this place!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"awesome experience, would definitely recommend!"
England,Male,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,6,8,6,8,"a decent enough hostel, it's clean and has a good location but didn't think it's worth '$41 a night in an 8 bed dorm. "
Australia,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,great hostel. noisy but confortable and friendly staff
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"what a great hostel! one of the best i have stayed at. breakfast was excellent, the rooms were really great. loved the full sized lockers with outlets... genius! and the privacy screens on the beds were great too, but they block the fan and no air conditioning is hard to adjust to. the staff were really nice, and helpful. the hostel was super clean, i saw them moving furniture to clean behind it every single day, i don't even do that at my house! i would stay again any time!"
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,6,10,8,8,6,8,8,"i am traveling from georgia to california. i did not want to spend an arm and a leg on a hotel, so a friend suggested i try staying at a hostel. upon arrival i am asked to show my passport- considering i came from ga i didn't have one. i was almost refused a place to stay because i was not traveling from abroad. i was allotted a bed for one night only and had to find another place for the duration of my trip. "
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,2,8,10,"place was clean and secure, however the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful."
Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"the staff at check-in seemed high. they didn't really know what was going on in reference to our booking through hostelworld. they claimed the hostelworld reservation didn't go through and that this had never happened before. then after 30 minutes, they managed to get me and my 2 friends in the same room.   otherwise, hostel was great. clean, quiet, great location and free morning breakfast."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,8,"aging hostel but it was decent.  room smelt very musty so we had to open the windows and turn on the fan.  appreciated the power outlets and light at every bed, and also the power outlet in the lockers!  good location for hollywood but be aware that it gets very noisy at night especially on fridays as there are loads of party animals in the area.  hostel is located next to a parking lot so there were loads of people, making car noises and what not.  had to compromise and close some windows..."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"you pay for what you get, its more expensive than other options but its clean, secure, good area, breakfeast is more than decent, power points, lights and privacy at each bed, cleaned daily. lots of activities. defs stay here again"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i liked it so much i didn't want to leave!! in fact, i haven't. i now work there :)"
Netherlands,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"the hostel is conveniently located, just a short walk from hollywood boulevard. the place is very secure, has a huge amount of staff and is extremely clean. the beds have quite some privacy, even for bunks. the downside is that the place is quite noisy, also from sounds outside. breakfast is included, with fresh pancakes. also, lots of tours are organized and airport transport at good prices. would stay again."
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"very nice and modern hostel, very clean, central to most places in hollywood! rooms spacious and nice, comfy bedsn everyone was friend however i thought that the staff were very rude at times and very abrupt. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,6,8,10,"i definitely recommend this hostel if you're doing anything in hollywood. i walked to runyan canyon park for great hiking, chinese theatre, pantages theatre, and it's really close to the red line which i took to and from union station and universal studios. and it's near bus 222 that i took to warner brothers studios. and the beds were amazingly comfortable! my room was 2 girls and 4 guys, everyone was super respectful. the pans for making pancakes were warped. . . big deal lol"
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"this is in a great location, right next to hollywood bvld. beds are comfy and staff are friendly and helpful for the most part but do not know everything so check on maps/internet if you want to go places. also while i was there the internet was not working which was frustrating!    however if you're looking for a decent, good value for money hostel and are relying on public transport in la this hostel does the job well."
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,8,10,"very clean, well organised, good location, good atmosphere and funny pub crawl. i would stay there again."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,i stayed here last year and its still a really great hostel to stay at if your in la! the breakfast options have changed though since :( no more yoghurt and banana
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i've stayed at quite a few hostels and this is by far the best one! a very good location and i felt safe in the neighbourhood and at the hostel. the staff knows a lot when it comes to good hikes, which bus to take or nice places to eat."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, friendly staff, loved the individual lights and powerpoints for each bed. free breakfast was excellent as we're the nightly dinners for $7. would recommend staying here."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really awesome place to be. hostel arranges loads of free walks or tour sign ups, discount attraction tickets. staff so helpful with all questions. easy to meet people in the social areas, and the beds are super comfy. would definitely stay again if ever in la. 10/10! thanks! "
Sweden,Male,25-30,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,"nothing bad to say about this hostel. a lot of staff and pricy, but location is good."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"location is everything, and it doesn't hurt that the rooms were tidy and the free breakfast in the morning was awesome too, will definitely recommend them to friends."
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"perfect when you only have one day in hollywood and want to see star avenue, universal studios etc. staff knowledgeable. great location. clean. fun but also very easy to get sleep. limo party was great. it's the perfect combination of being able to chill, to party or to sight see. slept very well very comfy beds. shuttle pick up to the airport. i can honestly say this was just the perfect place for that small time i had to see star avenue, hollywood blvd and the vip day trip to universal studios"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"great location - right in between hollywood blvd and sunset blvd. easy walk to lots of great places to eat as well.  rooms were clean, as was the bathroom.   great shuttle that runs between here and the hi at santa monica, or the airport, or other locations, which saved lugging our stuff around on the public buses. made life a lot easier!"
USA,Male,31-40,8,4,10,10,8,8,8,8,good place just a bit pricey i checked in at 4 45 am because the train stopped running at 12 and they gave me no discount
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"this hostel was really good place to enjoy hollywood mood! so many traveler and young people stay here, so u can feel vibrant energy. price is also reasonable but hostel offer u breakfast, towel, entertainment, etc. if i visit la again, probably i'm gonna stay this hostel. "
China,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"location is good, ten minutes walk to the subway. although it is a bit far away from the beach, there's free shuttle. the staff were always nice and helpful except the one that helped me checking in. great activities for meeting people. patio bbq is cool. met some awesome friends here!"
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"great atmosphere for socializing, meeting new people and winding down. loved the comedy show upstairs. front desk was helpful in recommending places to go, things to see, and restaurants to eat at."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, friendly staff, central location, lot of organized activities, good breakfast. i would recommend to friends."
Mexico,Male,25-30,6.3,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,"the staff was not helpful at all, everybody is a bit rude and this scheme of asking for your card every time you enter is really annoying. additionally, it was very expensive for what we got. the rooms are very small. last, all these signs trying to tell you how to behave made me feel in a boarding school"
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"besides it´s amazing kitchen, this hostel serves a poor variety of food for breakfast. comfortable beds and awsome shower. the decoration is modern and they offer a lot of tours around the city, some for free. the staff is very helpfull and everything is pristine. it would be almost perfect if wifi worked better."
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,good security. have to pass through checks at two separate doors to get in. if you rent a car there is a parking lot you have to pay for across the street ($20/day but you may be able to get a discount if you pay for a few days or week at a time). walking distance to main attractions on hollywood blvd. across the street from the lgbt center. walking distance to enterprise rental cars. free breakfast. i didn't have the breakfast but someone said there are pancakes. hot water lasts in the showers.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,it was a very friendly environment and the staff were very helpful and engaging. the location was fantastic as it was close to major attractions and other places were easily accessible via public transport. i had a very comfortable nights sleep throughout my stay and was very pleased with the security and cleanliness of the facilities.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,great location in terms of its proximity hollywood boulevard but hollywood itself is a bit boring with not much happening. otherwise no complaints!
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,"we had the worst snorer in our room! i got no sleep for 3 nights, also when we arrived the room and bathroom were pretty dirty and smelly..breakfast is very average. good activities planned though which is really convenient and the hostel hopper bus is awesome! "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,this is hostel is the best i have stayed at by far. their breakfast options and all you can eat dinners make your trip so much easier as you don't have to worry about spending so much money on food. the tours are well put together at affordable prices and delivered in such a great way. i really enjoyed staying here and would be back again in a heart beat!
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"really great! here for 2 nights. lovely staff, always helpful and friendly. right off hollywood blvd. close to universal studios on the metro. rooms good. with lockers. bathroom in room. very comfortable and relaxed. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, staff are fantastic!  very helpful and pleasant to be around.  breakfast was good.  i never got to do some of the activities they offered but they sounded great!  top job guys!"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  this hostel is towards the higher end on price but worth every penny! 
China,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel locates in a perfect place, very near to the hollywood walk of fame and the subway station as well. the staff are very friendly and helpful. i'd like to live here when i travel to la again."
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.6,8,8,4,10,10,10,10,i personally wouldn't stay in hollywood again but if that's what you want then this hostel is in a great spot. the only issue was that it was next to a carpark and there were often sketchy people hanging around the area.  this hostel was heaps of fun and was filled with australians! 
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,location is great for hollywood but la is very spread out so no location is ideal. definitely not easy without a car even though the hostel is close to two train stations.  security was great  staff were friendly and helpful and there were plenty of activities run by the hostel.
England,Male,31-40,8.3,6,10,8,8,8,10,8,"i had a fantastic time staying at this hostel - the activities are great and i met some really nice people. it is a bit far from the beach, but i think that is because the beach is in the wrong place - not the hostel! parking is expensive, more like $20/night than the $12 advertised on the website. perhaps do a deal with one of the local lots? staff were good, though perhaps a little too laid back occasionally. breakfast might need a bit of attention (as ever!)."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel and staff! definitly a good place to meet people and party if it's what you're looking for! i'll be back !
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,only stayed for one night but was a pleasure experience. 
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the ambiance was so calm on the front outdoor patio. lighting was state of the art. a hollywood calm.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great place. beds were great, daily activities were fun, location was amazing, staff were okkk, breakfast was sooooo good and showers were perfect. highly highly recommend this place and all the usa hostels. they are worth every penny."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"well located, and had everything you need supplied. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great place, our toilet kept over flowing, it's says turn off water and tell reception and i did but i don't think the chick wanted to get her hands dirty so she said we had to do it- not sure what would if happened if we made it worse i would of thought as a worker she would sort something like that out..some staff had attitude problems but i think maybe that's what happens if people staying there get employed,too cool to actually work n say hi to guests coz they are a guest, the rest was great"
England,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"excellent location just off the walk of fame and near most attractions.  staff helpful and friendly.  lots of trips available, happy to stay here again :)"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"no location in la is excellent because it's so spread out but the hostel was right off the walk of fame.. lots near by and close to public transport. only things to complain about was whilst i appreciate the security if the staff just saw me walk out the door when i try to go back in 30seconds later they could just buzz me in not make me dig out my key card again, bit over the top... tryin for use the washing machines was hard too when the staff were always using them for tea towels etc..."
Philippines,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,one of the best hostels in the us! i love the vibe! perfect for flashpackers and budget travellers! awesome kitchen. nice interiors. laundry service sucks. breakfast is great. rooms are very nice.
Netherlands,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"great location, nice lounge outside"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing staff especially tara and mellie
Sweden,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"nice hostel. i felt safe staying here, it was relatively clean and the staff was nice. superb location just by the hollywood boulevard. would recommend if you are used to hostel environments and are looking for a chill, simple place to stay! "
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,8,10,"good location with helpful staff, themed nights and tours were a bonus and i will probably stay here again if i am in the area."

Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i've stayed at this hostel a couple of times and it just keeps getting better!
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,i'm a oc native and i only stayed here one night because i got off work late and i missed the last train home. the atmosphere at the hostal reminded me of that of my european trips... the location was perfect to enjoy the rest night at the hollywood strip!
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"rooms were big, clean. great location, just off the strip and close to public transport though you can here a bit of noise from the strip at nights. staff were great. i would definitely stay here again."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel! the staff were super friendly, helpful and hilarious which made the stay really awesome. plus the kitchen facilities were great and they set up the luggage room really well - only staff members can go in and you have to present your bag number. this made me feel secure that no one would go through my stuff (lost a lock in my travels). cheers!"
England,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"this hostel is great, location is perfect with everything you need on your door step! close to bus stops and subway too if you decide to go to the beach or any other activities located further away. activities put on by the hostel are also worth the money.. cheaper than on the street! breakfast is greay you can refuel for the day! only thing i would suggest is bringing earplugs.. you can't escape the snorers!!!"
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"it's a minute walk from hollywood boulevard! it has a very nice terrasse outside where you can hang out and take a few drinks. there's a nice kitchen to hang out too, and the rooms are okay."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i have ever stay at! 
China,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"i feel very sorry for submit late,i come back to my country, the time differences is horrible! have to say this is the best choice in la, very lucky to be here,and the shuttle bus is very convenient by the way,thanks a lot!"
England,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,it was the best hostel i have never stayed in. the staff were great and the atmosphere and location was brilliant. i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to stay within central hollywood. i had a wonderful time!
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"clean, friendly hostel in a really good location right in hollywood boulevard and does great breakfast...what more can you want from a hostel?!"
Switzerland,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"the staff is very helpful and they have answers to all your questions :) well organized,shuttles,bbq's,pub crowls etc.location is good,not even a minute to hollywood blvd. very clean and nice people!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"best hostel i ever stayed! i'd highly recommend it. the only cons, was at the guy who checked me in, the gay one, i'm not homophobic because i'm a gay guy myself, the way the rules of the hostels were said sounded a bit condescending. "
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"nothing really to fault about this hostel - a really high standard. location was good, right on hollywood blvd and close to a lot of main tourist attractions. staff were good and always happy to help. you wouldn't regret staying here."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,a gorgeous hostel with friendly staff! it's also right off of hollywood blvd.   i had a great time here and all of the facilities were in great condition. they also have loads of walking tours and events to keep you busy! a great free breakfast and they even have flavoured coffee syrups!!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,8,10,great location just off the hollywood strip. 5 minutes to the walk of fame and the metro station which will take you to universal studios. great kitchen and general store only 5 minutes away. lots of free or cheap activities. i stayed for 2 nights and preferred santa monica but if you want to stay in the thick of things this is your place. pretty expensive for a hostel but i would consider it value
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,the dinner at night are bit pricy 7$ for only pasta and also  the  tours to berverlly hill a bit pricy because done by public transport and did not inclue the return fair      over all nice  placeto stays
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i highly recommend here. a little bit far from the metro station(5~10minutes on foot, 5 blocks away from the station) but its just located in the heart of the hollywood and quite near to the universal studio. there are homeless people on the street but the security here is very good, staffs are really kind, facilities are much more than i expected. and you can reserve a shuttle to santa monica beach, disney land, or universal studio, etc with reasonable price."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,4,10,8,"one guy on night reception duty just wasn't doing his job. around 11pm, our group had to buzz ourselves in, having waited for about 10mins to be let in. he suddenly ran down the stairs and swore at us for doing that. 10 minutes later, i saw him swinging his keys, casually hanging around the luggage storage area, again not at reception. another group of boys buzzed themselves in and he bolted down the corridor to have another power trip with them. really unprofessional."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"all i can say is everytime i have stayed at this hostel, i've had the time if my life and the staff are beyond brilliant. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,great sofa area at the front to meet people and discuss the previous nights bar crawl. although the area doesn't seem safe (which some reviews said) there's enough people around at all times and it wasn't an issue. 
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"excellent hostel, great activities planned and organised by really good staff! it was also the cleanest and best run hostel i've been to in a long time. only thing it misses to make it the best is the most important thing.... a bar (or simply to sell beer!)"
Australia,Male,18-24,5.7,2,6,8,8,6,4,6,"no air conditioning and poor ventilation with inappropriate supply of fans, makes this place pretty unbearable in the hotter weather.     the common area outside is a bit weird and dark and the people hanging around are typically pretty ghetto. they also source a lot of their staff as free labour (for allowing them to stay for free), so this results in staff not always being professional or knowledgeable.     $56/night for this is terrible value."
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,6,10,"very professionally run hostel, with excellent security. location good, 20 minute walk from metro station, which will take  you everywhere. breakfast was average, could maybe do with a wider  selection. pillows very lumpy. beach shuttle  not as advertised... only ran once a week, that we could see and only took the  first 15 people with their name on the list."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10," very close to the metro stations, which is a great thing, if you don't decide to drive a car! very close to hollywood! "
England,Male,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,8,10,"expensive but worth it for the location. the dorm rooms are big however no aircon makes them extremely hot in the evening.. although there was a heatwave in la whilst i was there, the single noisy fan in the corner tries to make up for this but just moves the warm air around.    other than that, excellent staff, great laundry facilities and good security with security gates and lockers."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,most of the staff were really friendly and accommodating.  the great atmosphere over a game of beer pong was great and the pub crawls and tours that are offered are all of good value and a great way to meet others staying.  really good friendly atmosphere with good breakfast and close to all that hollywood and la has to offer.
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel! so much fun. met some awesome people :) the only thing that sucked.... was i got my car towed at 230 am.... and had to go get it at the impound lot... hahaa. but i suppose that was my own fault, just be careful on parking if you do have a rental vehicle or anything :) "
Sweden,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,10,8,8,8,"only not so clean area of the hostel was the dishes and dishracks in kitchen. evwything else was great. nice breakfast, free coffee, goodnsecurity, comfy beds....thanks"
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel ever, everyone in the room got on so well and we all had plenty to drink!  beer pong was funny, great to sit outside and chill with everyone.  johnny on reception is a legend, keeps the place going!  big thanks, amazing atmosphere here."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,6,10,"coming from a party hostel where everyone  wanted to make friends, including the staff, compared to that hostel this hostel lacked atmosphere, but i guess that is because its a whole different target market, needless to say though, the fact that you got so much for your money and the prime location really does make up for it. i liked the fact that you held things like luau parties for guests to get to know each other, it was just less enforced than in previous hostels that ive stayed in."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"was an amazing stay, amazing staff and they knew how to entertain their customers. "
England,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,10,6,"great location, locked front door at all times and very social. nearly all times of the day there will be other travellers hanging out at the front and at night the drinking and partying starts! literally 20 seconds from hollywood blvd."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,6,10,8,"staff has high fluctuation, 2/3 seem to be new... because they have a program that u can stay for free if u work for hostel... so they have a lot of people there, but its not always sure which one is doing what"
HongKong,Male,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,6,8,"i just stayed for one night, so maybe the activities these are awesome but i didn't explore.  good: nice staff to give you all the suggestion even discount for uber. laundry available even though it maybe fully occupied for sometimes. very good location, very close to the hollywood street.  bad: people living there are not nice, they seldom talk or say hello. the room is small with 6 males and luggage is easily be a mess. only one bathroom and restroom for 6, not enough."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,6,10,8,10,10,"the hostel had good communal areas where you could sit and drink meeting other people. it also hosted many events, such as pubcrawls, comedy nights, etc which gave the hostel a good atmosphere. in addition, there were shuttle buses organized for almost every day of the week to go to a chosen location (sometimes free),  the dorm beds come with a privacy cover and shelf with a power point and light which was really handy. the staff were very helpful and friendly."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location and helpful staff.
England,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved it, stayed in many hostels this was the best, such high security, really strict with who comes in and out and organisation really good for trips and hikes, so easy to make friends if you join in activities. loves that meals were cooked for everyone to eat togther so you can meet people there too. come here if you wanna make 100 friends and love drinking. fit staff too 🙊"
Turkey,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"free breakfast, kitchen with a huge fridge, hollywood ;-)   i would stay here again."
Austria,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i had a great stay, nothing more to say :)"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,10,6,4,8,"the hostel itself is great but i didn't like the atmosphere. not a good place to make friends, it seems people there are more worried to look fancy and stare their cellphones on the nice sofas there than socialize."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel, loads of activities organised each day, cheap and well coordinated. they offer free accommodation if you're there for three weeks or more willing to work for them. good food selection at breakfast. tony and matt were legends."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,an enjoyable experience overall. right in hollywood and tons of fantastic day and night activities to participate in.
China,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel is good, but outside every night is very noisy.  breakfast not so good."
Netherlands,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was absolutely amazing! the best hostel i have ever stayed at!  i have not been bribed or anything as such, i am being very honest here. it was great!"

Germany,Female,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"my stay was awesome and many thanks to the helpful, friendly, funny and amazin staff! and especially thanks to johnny, steven, luis, matt, tony and michael! they are awesome and made my stay a wonderful experience that i won't forget!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,10,8,"this hostel had one of the best atmospheres from my entire trip in the us, everyone was keen to meet people, socialise and have a few drinks. rooms were pretty spacious. good social area outside. hollywood wasn't the greatest part of town imho, but if i was to head back there for some reason, i'd stay in the usa hostels."
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i#ve ever seen!   it's clean, in a great location (one step out of the door and you're on the hollywood blvd), close to a metro stattion, awesome stuff that halps you with everything and amazing offers!"
Argentina,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"the place is very nice, and the best of all are those vans and the tours you offer."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"there was no wifi in rooms, and so the lobby had people only using wifi, and not social people during the day."
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel in town for sure!
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"super awesome atmosphere, everyone was really friendly and it was easy to meet people."

Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"the outdoor patio was awesome, a good place to hang out and relax during the day and cool place to meet people during the evening. great bbq organized by the hostel, awesome pubcrawl on friday night!   the hostel is next to many bars and nightclubs, so the nightlife was great. during the daytime however i'd suggest you leave for venice beach, santa monica, bc downtown hollywood had, imo, notg interesting to see. also some weirdos outside the hostel but very safe in the hostel!"
China,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was just great! keep up the good work!
USA,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"extremely clean with very courteous staff. location is ideal for hollywood, which is actually a very nice place. ssecurity is awesome and i love the outdoor lounge. lots of activities and excursions. so many things to see and do within the general area. only one bathroom, or so i thought. turns out there were also halway bathrooms that i wasn't aware of."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,great hostel and very centrally located to the hollywood attractions. the staff are really friendly and helpful! 
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,6.9,6,10,8,6,6,6,6,"the hostel itself is quite good, but the location whilst convenient is right next to hollywood boulevard which is a bit grotty.    good breakfast facilities."
England,Male,25-30,6.3,4,10,8,4,6,6,6,"this hostel is very close to walk of fame. typical usa hostel, with a kitchen and a hang out room. i personally dont like staying in hollywood which is why i wont stay here but thats not the hostels fault. hostel has standard beds and is clean."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,all staff very friendly and helpful.  would help if kitchen was bigger. breakfast time always very crowded.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,6,6,8,i enjoyed my stay. i had a negative experience with the shuttle recommended by the hostel. there were events organized by the hostel but not as many as i would expect because they market themselves as a party hostel. could have more nighttime events. 
China,Male,25-30,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"the hollywood district is not safe. but the hostel is excellent. it refreshes my impression of the idea ""hostel"".  the only one thing which was considered inconvenient is that the hole in the toilet seat is too small for males. "
Turkey,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i think it's the best you can find in the middle of hollywood. breakfast is very good, location is perfect, staff is amazing. i will certainly stay there when i go back to la."
USA,Couple,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"nice hostel. didn't have ""proof of onward travel"" since i drove there from instate. they were nice enough to let it go but said i couldn't extend my reservation. so in the case an emergency happens and you have to extend your stay, maybe bring your work schedule for proof if you're from instate?"
China,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"absolutely fantastic! the staff were super friendly (except for one dude on kitchen duties :/ ), it's small but very very cozy and pretty, making convo was really easy. excellent crowd and activities, a lil out of the way but close to the metro. recommend!!! "
Thailand,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,i live location
Scotland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,staff were very friendly and helpful at all times no matter what you asked! rooms were clean and great atmosphere throughout the whole hostel! in a great location walking distance to most tourist attractions and public transport. only thing is there are quite a lot of homeless in this area but cause no trouble!
France,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,8,6,i had some doubts about the cleanliness of my sheets when they gave it to me 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"second time i've stayed here, just as good as the first. good shuttle service on offer to la tourist destinations too"
Germany,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"i definitely recommend this hostel. the outside area is very nice to hang out and meet people. also, usa hostels encourage drinking and parties....which is great from my pov. if you are traveling through california, check out the usa hostel in sf as well."
Taiwan,Male,25-30,5.7,2,6,10,6,6,4,6,"i dont think it value for 50usd per night, they put me on the 1st floor down to the hall way last dorm, it was right beside to a parking lot and was a staurday night, around 3am they were the loudest music play by car and people drink and shoutting, around 4am we heared drunk people kicking and talking loud over and 6am the trush truck was on cleaning about 30min super loud as well, i didnt had sleep that night and worst was needed to catch a flight at the second day, not recommened."
Australia,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"staff were the highlight of this hostel, it is super close to hollywood attractions but doesn't have fanstastic baras/food close by."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the place as a whole was clean and very welcoming. would 100% stay here again.
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,really great place - definitely out best hostel so far. the people at reception were really helpful and there is a really fun atmosphere here but most importantly the breakfast is amazing - those pancakes and worth the money alone ! 
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,8,6,staff were very friendly and helpful. they showed you around and explained everything when you first arrive which was great. 
Australia,Female,31-40,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,i had my hair straightener stolen from the bathroom i assume by the cleaners cause i was in a room full of boys and i doubt they would have wanted it
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"i had a great time staying, staff were helpful and there was a range of extra activities available."
England,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"nice hostel, would stay there again. i have to mention the staff are outstanding, they were very helpful "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great staff that encouraged more of a party atmosphere out in the front seating area. good location, very close to hollywood blvd without being too loud."
Sweden,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel!
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic hostel ticked every box not a single thing i can think of to tell you that isn't great!
Brazil,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"the hostel was great, very neat, clean, fun, and with very good facilities."
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,you are awesome guys =d
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved it here!  i'm a really shy quiet person but i managed to meet and make friends here.   also shout out to the reception blonde with a (british accent i believe) works in the mornings. really took care of the guys in our room after an incident with someone who had too much to drink.    i will most likely be staying here or over at podshare when i visit la
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, great location, plenty of activities free or low cost, free breakfast, rooms are great, some power points in lockers are also great"
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,my stay at the hostel for a night was perfect
USA,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,6,6,6,6,"i have mixed feelings about this place. the location is awesome and the front patio is a great hangout spot. it is also nice that there is a bathroom inside the dorm. however, i booked for 2 people but they put us in separate rooms. the apathetic front desk staff member, jaimie kept repeating that they sometimes can't put groups together... sorry but 2 people doesn't count as a group! i wouldn't say she was rude but just cold/uncaring. luckily, another staff noted to give us $10 for the mistake"
Germany,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"if you want to meet people in a nice athmosphere next to the hollywood boulevard,  this is exactly the right place to do. i had a wonderful time. thanks to all the nice staff, who always tried to find a solution for every problem or question."
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"very friendly helpful staff, room was lovely clean and spacious. decent sized lockers, well located hostel. enjoyed my stay!"
Serbia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i don't have anything negative to say about this place. met some amazing people on the patio and through the hostel's very well organized events. was easy to get around as it's close to two metro stations and has great connections with the hostel hopper. friendly staff, but louie was the most memorable because he'd hang out with the guests on the patio and make sure everyone was having a good time on the pub crawl."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,8,10,"this hostel is a great location for people wanting to visit the hollywood area. they offer numerous tours/shuttles (some are free), and $7 all-you-can-eat dinners. the rooms are a good size, with a clean en suite bathrooms. the night-lights and power sockets for each bed are great. some staff were friendly and welcoming, others were not and seemed to have an attitude."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,felt just like home away from home. $7 all you can eat dinner some nights is amazing :) lovely staff always happy to help. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,10,8,"good location, good vibe and helpful staff. the best thing was the privacy pods on the beds with a power point, light and little shelf. all hostels should have these. would stay here again."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"loved my stay at this hostel! greatly recommended. rooms were clean, each bed had it's own socket and night light.  bathroom was clean as well. the kitchen was ok, breakfast in the morning could include milk. patio in the front had a very good ambiance and very great for socializing.     would stay there again!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel. incredibly easy to meet people and make new friends. the walking tours are great as are the pub crawls and the shuttle buses to other places. bit of a dodgy area of a night time but besides that, i loved it. would definitely stay there again."
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,8,8,10,"the location simply cannot be beat. it's just off of hollywood blvd. i also loved the privacy pods with the little light, shelf, and outlets. the upstairs hangout room was underutilized; not sure why. the free breakfast was great! make sure you sign up early for the shuttle to venice beach, i had to take a different shuttle which wasn't free but still a pretty good deal. i saw the people who worked at the hostel constantly cleaning the place which was nice. i'd stay here again!"
Netherlands,Female,18-24,5.7,6,8,8,6,2,6,4,got yelled at by staff. like full on actually yelled at. they told us breakfast was served at 6 and i had to leave for the airport at 6.20 however they didn't have breakfast yet. i asked the guy who was setting it up if maybe he could just grab me a bagel or something and he went off at me. he was humiliating and unnecessary and just unacceptable.  was also not impressed by the cleanliness since we were baking pancakes out of the sam's pan for hours with batter that wasn't cooled. tour was bad 
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,first hostel visit ever in the states. i liked it a lot. staff could have told us that there were extra bathrooms and not only the ones in the room. other than that i was happy with my stay.
Brazil,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,"all pub crows around de world are free, in this hostel we have to pay 15 dolars, does no make sense...  but in general, this hostel is good."
Turkey,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,8,10,"the hollywood boulevard is a little bit sketchy but we were ok. there is a parking lot across the street, we paid 50$ for 3 night. hostel has all equipped kitchen, ensuite room was really nice. according to my reservation i remembered that the tax was included in the room price but when we checked in. it was not :(  also the receptions in european hostels are a bit more friendlier."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. highly recommended. the social atmosphere is fantastic.
China,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"compared with other hostels, the breakfast is not that good."
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,10,8,"i love this hostel, i met a lot of people there... the rooms are pretty comfortable... great security... the staff is not as friendly as the hostel, but you can handle with that.... they have a shuttle service from hostel to lax for 16 usd... i'll stay here again on my next la visit."
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,8,6,8,8,"the excellent breakfast gets you started. plenty of entertaining activities while indoors.   central location is perfect for exploring l.a. (not just the tourist attractions but the real los angeles.)  safe...frequent law enforcemt patrols &amp; close proximity of police station, the security team keep the large homeless population at bay &amp; brazen panhandlers in check.  front desk personnel are either very friendly or very unfriendly.  la is known for 100 degree days but there is no air conditioning"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"the usa hostel in hollywood is not as good as their one in san fran. excellent location, good staff, but no real indoor area conducive to hanging around and meeting people (tv is always on). there is an outdoor area but this gets way too hot. the rooms at night also get pretty stuffy. good wifi, decent kitchen &amp; free continental breakfast provided. also a great pub crawl put on by the hostel and the area is fantastic for the night life! the night shift worker needs to calm down slightly."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,6,10,10,some of the staff proved to be unhappy and unreasonable at times.
India,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"usa hostel is a nice hostel with a very good location , staff is really helpful , would love to go back and stay "
Mexico,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,i like very much this hostel for the location and atmosphere
Norway,Male,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,6,10,cool common aria out side. best standard of all hostels i stayed in usa florida/ los angeles.  (that doesn't take much)
SouthKorea,Female,31-40,7.4,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,글쎄요... 여러가지 행사를 많이하는건 좋은것 같아요. 무료투어 행사도 진행하고.. 근데 전체적으로 시간도 안지키고... 너무 늦게까지 술마시는 사람이 많은데다 시끄러움
Germany,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,i pad works quite slowly.
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,all good. all roubd.
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome!!!
Germany,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,"the hostel was ok but the area was really bad. it's very close by to the walk of fame but this is it! nothing to do in this area! it's 1,5 hours away from the beach and the nice areas! "
Turkey,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you wanna have fun in la, this is the hostel that you are looking for! excellent atmosphere. the staff is super nice and very organized. normally i don't like pub crawl kinda parties but the one that they offer was so much fun. their branch in san francisco was also awesome. these guys really know how to run a hostel. do not even hesitate a sec to book them, go head!!"
Switzerland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,we met a lot of great people and the staff was great too 
Canada,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,"los angeles is a very big city, it would be difficult to be very well-located, since everything is spread off. the hostel is near hollywood boulevard, but far from everything else. the little courtyard is great, i'd like every hostel has one like this! that is the best place to meet people."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"hostel is right off the walk of fame, from where you can see the hollywood sign. there are pan handlers and homeless people around, but safe enough. walls were a bit thin and someone was doing wheelies in the neighbouring parking lot the first night. however everything else was very good, including the free tours."
England,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"this hostel is in a really good area of hollywood, staff are very nice and really helpful, there is good areas to meet people."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"an all-round great experience. clean and fun. most of the staff were great, except one had a negative attitude."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great hostel- free unlimited pancakes, just off hollywood blvd, incredibly helpful staff, very safe and secure! take quarters if you want to use the laundry facilities. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,8,8,hostel is right in the middle of hollywood and has a great mix of people. the check in process is brilliant with a private escort taking you to your room and explaining all the features. wifi is brilliant and the power outlet in the beds (and lockers) is great. it is fairly pricey however this is la.
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,not the cheapest hostel but by far the best facilities i have ever experienced :) great helpful staff too
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent attention to details in the design of the dorms;very convenient location;friendly,courteous, helpful staff; awesome outdoor patio . my 3rd stay here and will be back. ."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thoroughly enjoyed the experience. kim (the blond female) was awesome in making sure my stay was comfortable. a very nice lady. mellie was great also! this is a good hostel at a great location.
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,6,10,very clean hostel! 
Norway,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,4,6,8,8,"1 bathroom for 8 people is not enough. nice outdoor area. next to hollywood boulevard, which has not so much going on, really, so i wouldn't want to stay in that area for more than a day or two. most people working there seemed over worked, but i find that is the case in other usa hostels as well. they helped you out and answered your questions though. ok for a couple of nights."
Belgium,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my experience in this hostel was fantastic. the usa hostel branch is the best i've stayed in so far. i've met so many good people, nice location, safe and clean. no free parking, but you can park your car across the street for a discouny if you tell you're staying at usa hostels."
Brazil,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,10,2,6,10,"the hostel is clean, safe, plays music during the day, but dont expect to meet interesting people there.  la is hard city to get.. so you will meet typical  tourists. the types ones that dont travel alone, too cool for school.the front desk staff , that blond girl..american one.. likes to play cool, but was very mean, when i asked her if i could print a paper for free, she said once yes.. but i didnt hear and second time i asked she said i told u yes.. very mean voice."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"the hostel is in a good location, pretty much off the walk of game and a short walk to the chinese theatre. loved the privacy screens on the beds and free brekkie is always a bonus. would come back again."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,10,2,10,8,"asked at the reception how to get to the hollywood sign, got: ""here's a citymap, info is all on the back!"" he seriously refused to explain it to me... very bad and unprofessional customer service! thx johnny"
Italy,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,for sure one of the best hostel i have ever been! yes it was quite expensive but considering you are in hollywood blv  is not  justified???
England,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i have every stayed in!!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i liked the free hikes and shuttle to venice beach.  
China,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"though didn't speed long time in the hostel, but the stuffs are so kind to help me. great yard to relax and meet new friends."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"the staff are amazing. super friendly, very knowledgeable. one night our group had a shady character follow us all of the street and the bloke behind the desk looked after it all and hearded 10 drunks up stairs no worries the beds are some of the best i have had, they have a metal hide away style thing that has some powerpoint's etc - awesome idea. i'm 6""3 and still managed to squeeze ok too.  nightly events are sick, the meals and everything.  best hostel i have been too"
Brazil,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good hostel, but hollywood was not my favorite place to stay."
China,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"generally, the hostel is very good. it is very clean, and the general environment is very friendly. i like the breakfast, which is very convenient and save you a lot of trouble. i also like the kitchen, so that i can cook my own foods with all the cookers and dishes provided. i like the bed and the lockers too, because they provide several plugs for charging electronic devices. though it is a bit more expensive than other hostels, it is worth the money."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,the staff were very helpful with recommending places for me to visit. i had a great time and will consider staying here next time i go on a trip in california!
England,Female,31-40,7.1,8,8,10,8,6,6,4,"location great &amp; activities provided by the hostel on a budget were a bonus. the 2 that i went on were with staff who had knowledge of the area and enthusiasm! however, at reception the staff were hit and miss. generally you had to wait for them to finish their conversation before they acknowledged you. the additional shower (though there is no block, just the odd one) was really dirty and uninviting. the rooms were ok but 6 girls &amp; 1 shower means an additional shower block is necessary!"
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,6,10,10,8,10,"great hostel , really comfy stay...and a bunch of really great friendly staff "
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel. so clean. very safe. the staff was incredible too. highly recommend this place! a bit expensive for a hostel, but you definitely get what you pay for."
Denmark,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was my first time travelling on my own and this hostel has a nice outdoor area, where you can hang out and meet  people. beside that there is a lot of social activities. the rooms are clean, the staff friendly, delicious breakfast. perfect!"
Mexico,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"very good hostel, highly recommended."

Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a very social, safe and fun hostel. its so close to everything in hollywood, and the staff have great advice to negotiate public transport etc to get around la. my only regret i wish i stayed longer! i loved the idea for all the walking groups, night dinners and i loved how social this place was. the rooms are really spacious and i love the fact you have your own powerpoint and light in your bed. highly recommend this place"
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10/10--all areas !!
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, great atmosphere,  great location.  i've stayed in all three locations and this one is definitely the best"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"more expensive than other hostels i've stayed at, but good overall!! there were lots of organised activities like $6 all you can eat barbeque and tours and things, great outdoor space and good atmosphere! also beds are good with a light, shelf, and powerpoint for each bunk, and lockers in the rooms too."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent stay, my favourite hostel in the states. great atmosphere, easy to meet people and have a good night. lots of activities during the day and the staff are very helpful. very secure and in a really good location being so close to hollywood. would happily stay here again, thanks for a good stay."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,great hostel in a great location. regular activities organised and a decent breakfast. staff were always cheerful and up for a chat. only problem we had was our dorm shower wouldn't drain properly so showers had to be quick and we would have to wait a while for the next person. will definitely stay again.
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location if you want to see hollywood and other central sites. quite a noisy gruby area but that's hollywood i guess! no complaints about the hostel. breakfast was great!
USA,Female,41+,7.4,6,8,10,2,10,6,10,"not that there's much to do to fix it, but every sound: footsteps doors whispers in halls or courtyard every sound carries into the rooms and makes it almost impossible to fall or stay asleep, even with earplugs.  i've stayed in hi and other hostels all over the world, this is the worst acoustically. that is too bad because of the location and staff both are exceptional. just had to say it."
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,6,8,10,8,10,"as per my review of usa hostels san francisco, if big corporates pour lots of money into a hostel it ends up looking something like this. big, well planned, standardised procedures, etc. if that's your thing then this place is perfect for you - if you are looking for somewhere with ""character"" then this probably isn't right for you."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"seriously good hostel in a great location, staff are amazing and make you feel more than welcome , especially the aussie!! fantastic socialising area out front 5*"
USA,Female,18-24,5.7,8,8,4,4,6,6,4,"unfortunately i checked out two days early due to uncleaness and uncomfort. the rooms had bad odor, the location is horrible, the kitchen and breakfast was a bit filty and un-spacious. aside from the money convinced, hopefully these concerns are resulted for the next guest. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great hostel and easy to meet people.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,6,10,pretty good location. it's near all the weird dudes who dress up. i met batman and he spat on me. i tried to climb the fence to the place next door but the barbed wire cut me lol. the hostel is actually expensive though. you can make your own la experience at home by just emptying your garbage bin in your living room and inviting that crazy guy who always yells at you when you walk past his house over. how does he even have a house? is that a government program? i'm going to google it.
France,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, confortable, wifi ok . sweet garden !!!"
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"staff are awesome, and really helpful "
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,location  and facilities
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,10,8,6,8,"this was a nice, clean, hostel. great location-- couple blocks away from the train. there was a bar/club crawl on the night i arrive which i enjoyed, even though i'm not a club-loving person. it felt like i was the only american there but it was fun. the dining area was really small and so i ate at the bar/lounge/gaming area upstairs (i got angry looks from the staff who were cleaning the area at 8am). no matter, i just basically needed a place to store my bag and sleep during the night."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location - close to runyon canyon, walk of fame, hollywood blvd and shopping. also very close to subway stations, buses and hop on-hop off bus stops. hostel has good facilities and i felt safe. staff at front desk are friendly and helpful and are happy to organise airport transfers, certain tours and shuttles on your behalf. would stay here again."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,great hostel. staff are friendly and helpful. location is close to everything.
Sweden,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"can't imagine staying anywhere else. if you want to be in hollywood, this place is the best."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,really clean and well looked after hostel. would stay again. great atmosphere. 
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel, would recommend to anyone wanting an up beat hostel in hollywood! plenty of activities going on every day and lots of places to socialize and meet new people. would defiantly stay here again! "
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"very busy hostel, great for party atmosphere.  probably go somewhere else for a more chilled out vibe."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've stayed at! different activities every day, great staff, close to everything, fun vibes. 100% recommend"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"i had a lovely stay at usa hostels!! security was very good and the staff were absolutely exceptional!!! i had a lovely stay, thank you :)"
Malaysia,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,10,8,8,6,very near hollywood walk of fame...location is superb!
France,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,8,4,6,10,"a few good things: breakfast is incredibly generous and good, the whole hostel is very clean! however, i did not really enjoy my stay there. the staff can be helpful but not friendly at all.. usually i go to hostel because of the friendly and curious people working there, and i haven't had any interaction with them, not even a ""good morning""... that's sad. also it is incredibly noisy during the night (bars and usps). it is quite expensive for what it is, not a great experience."
Japan,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,"this is a very big hostel. everything is clean, nice room, nice common lounge. but i wanted better breakfast."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,6,6,6,10,"a pretty large hostel and it feels like it (ie not very personal), but otherwise it was still quite social. australians dominated the clientele.    everything was clean and the beds were comfy, the breakfast was a bit lacking."
England,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,a very nice clean hostel. lots of activities to sign up for in the day and night. (comedy show... so bad it was good!)  the lounge bar is open every night even when empty but it wasn't too noisy past midnight and the kitchen was open all night for quietness.  the privacy boards on the bunks were good but at the same time make people more isolated so good and bad.  a very good location.  90% of people there were australians because it's their summer holidays in our winter i guess!
Russia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,6,10,8,8,8,"fairly good place located right on the hollywood boulevard (which is not a big pro). great facilities, organized activities, friendly atmosphere. generally good."
Portugal,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,10,8,"it is between two subway station, a very convenice place.  restaurants, bars are nearby."
Australia,Female,18-24,6,2,8,6,6,8,6,6,"this place was average. processed, carby breakfast, a ridiculous number of rules and signs, uncomfortable and cheap bedding, and best of all you are paying through the nose for it! i was only here as a transfer to the airport and to get some shopping in, and thankfully did not stay long - on the upside, it is clean, safe and the staff were very cheerful."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,"although i wasn't a huge fan of hollywood, this hostel allows excellent access and organizes many tours daily. it is super clean and very secure at night with no visitors allowed inside. the bar can get lively and the outdoor seating area is excellent for relaxing in the day or having beeeers at night. "
Indonesia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a pleasant stay at usa hostels hollywood! i was stayed in the 6-mixed bedroom:  - the room was very clean with real bed, blanket, bed linens and a fan.  - the bathroom was very clean with free fresh towels and hot shower.  - the shared kitchen was big enough with free breads, oatmeals, fresh fruits and hot beverages.    the location was also great! it just blocks away from the metro train station and bus stops. i'll definitely be back to stay in usa hostels hollywood, highly recommended!"
China,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,6,"bathtub was full of hair, mattress wasn't clean, the door lock broken on the last day"
Hungary,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff is super cool, a place worth staying."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,10,8,10,6,"despite some of the smelly, unhygienic, weird people that were put in the same mixed-dorm room with me, i had an overall pleasant stay."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,10,6,great location and fabulous choice of breakfast. extremely convenient. rules about quiet hours and cleanliness need to be upheld however and personal space in the room needs to be respected. wonderful staff who were happy to help.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,8,10,8,10,10,i loved staying here! i think that it is a great base to explore the city and it was a great place to just hang out if you didn't want to go out! i would definitely stay here again!
Ireland,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,great location just off hollywood blvd. and easy to find. staff were very helpful. good deals in the bar.
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i've ever stayed in. the usa hostels chain is brilliant and i would definitely use them again!
USA,Male,31-40,6,4,10,8,6,2,4,8,"i´ve been staying in hostels for many years and it is the first time i get such rude staff as i got at usa hostel la.  location is ok, but the hostel is not good.  long waits to use the bathroom, pub crawl sucks, staff don´t give a sh**t about you.    i would not recommend this hostel"
Norway,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,8,10,10,awesome hostel! great location and atmosphere.
Japan,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,10,10,8,8,stuff were sooo kind! we can spentgreat time. but unfortunately my roommate was little bit noisy.
England,Female,31-40,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,10,8,great stay at the hostel. ideally placed just a short walk from hollywood blvd. plenty of activities taking place at the hostel everyday and the staff are extremely helpful.  shared bathroom is cleaned everyday. take the red bus tour which takes you to the best places to see in los angeles.
Ireland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"without doubt the best hostel i've stayed in in 3 years of travelling.. security was top notch, location was central, rooms and bathrooms were super clean, loved the privacy of the bunks! staff were friendly and informative! absolute 100% 😀"
England,Female,25-30,5.7,6,8,8,4,6,6,2,dorm room and bathroom both needed cleaning. facilities were minimal and not enough for the size of the hostel -e.g. there was no room for breakfast even though we tried several times.
Switzerland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,very warm welcome and helpfull staff. thank you.
Ireland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, very sociable."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, excellent activities, lovely staff. stay here!"
Portugal,MixedGroup,25-30,6.9,6,10,8,6,8,6,4,"the security is one of the best of all the hostels where i've stayed. you have to show your room card key whenever you pass past the lobby and there are lockers with outlets inside (but you have to bring your own padlock). concerning location, it is right next to the walk of fame and it has three parking lots nearby. however, there is only one bathroom with shower per dormitory of 8 and no communal facilities (which is clearly not enough!) and the cleaning should be done more often."
CzechRepublic,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel. organised activities every day, clean place, professional staff and whole hostel organisation, nice breakfast, power chords right next to every pillow and in locker box, privacy for everyone even in 8 bed dorm, advanced security. 5 minutes from metro station and 1 minute from holywood boulevard. what else to wish."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,6,8,give information about the pariking!!!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,it does get hot in the dorm rooms but love the free wifi and if your from australia take a tube of vegimite you will need it for all they had was jam and butter for the bagels and toast for the free brekkie in the morning which was pretty epic 
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,lyn and myself had a great time loved everything about the place highly recommend very clean love it.
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"great place to meet people of all ages, always something going on to explore more of la and the many nearby bars. only negative is the metal lockers which make too much noise when people check out early. if you're a fan the movie point break, check out the point break live show in the bar directly down the road on santa monica blvd."
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stayed here for a couple of days in the beginning of november.  check in processes was quick and explained throuroughly.  rooms are clean as are the ensuites. staff always had time to help give you directions or sightseeing tips.  and whenever is extended my stay they always tried to keep me in the same room.   met some really nice people in the patio/smoking area.   one thing i wish i'd done was go on one of the sightseeing trips they arrange for people staying.   highly recommended!!
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel had a lot going on. events everyday, as well as being pretty much in the heart of hollywood. a 2 minutes walk to hollywood boulevard... very good on security - you had to show your key-card to be buzzed into the hostel proper. great range of items very close by, and the staff were always happy to help!"
England,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at this hostel. all the activities they organise make it a sociable place and great for solo travellers. the kitchen is one of the best i've ever seen in a hostel and the breakfast was good too. it's great for hollywood boulevard but at night this area looks a bit rough - i never saw or heard of any actual trouble, but it's not as glam as it sounds! still, if you want to stay in hollywood this is probably  the best value you'll get."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"we had a great experience at usa hostels hollywood. we did not spend much time at the hostel other than to sleep and have breakfast, but it seemed to have a great ambiance and offered tours and activities at a reasonable cost. it was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. also, it had a great breakfast included in the cost per night. i would definitely recommend staying here :)"
SouthKorea,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,6,10,8,8,10,it is a good hostel.
Thailand,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,6,10,10,8,8,"i stayed in 8-bed room, everything was great !   but if you're tall i recommend you to take the upper bed. the lower one was too short, i can't even sit on it properly (i'm 180 cm)"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,very secure hostel. i was only in transit through la but the staff where extremely helpful and the hostel organises plenty of activities to do every single day. the location is very central to hollywood blvd which is a good and and a bad thing depending on the type of trip you are after. the hostel itself however is a fun and safe environment to make friends and enjoy la.
Colombia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly staff. free wifi. current adapter next to the bed and plenty in the common areas, lockers inside the room. many activities organized by the hostel. central location close to many attractions. breakfast included. big kitchen. nice patio to chill out or wait. cheap beer in the bar. nice lounge to read or watch tv. it's like the perfect hostel."
France,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,thanks to kim for being a supportive staff member!
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location, friendly staff, and an excellent value for the money. it can be a little noisy at times at night - due to it's proximity to clubs and bars. if you're a light sleeper bring a pair earplugs for sleeping"
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"very good hostel! location is perfect. the bunkers have individual lights and power sockets. there were also sockets inside the lockers. good breakfast and nice common area for meeting people. the front door is open all the time, so non-guests can freely access the patio. beggers actually entered the hostel twice during my stay. but the dorms entrance is closed, so it was not an issue. staff promptly requested them to leave."
Belgium,Female,25-30,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,i really like the  privacy in the dorms. the screens were an excellent idea. overall a good and clean hostel. friendly staff as well.

Vietnam,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"very lovely and helpful staffs. the location is perfect. the only thing i dont like about it is the air-conditioner system. there's no air-con in the dorm, so it's really hot whenever we get back to the dorm after a long day."

Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,4,6,4,10,roma were spacious and clean- but did not like that anyone could get though the front door into the hostel sitting area..
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is fantastically located, packed with friendly and helpful staff, and with excellent facilities. the location is not just convenient for tacky hollywood tourist stuff, but walking or short bus distances from the likes of cinefamily, the ucb theatre and nerdmelt, as well as nightclubs. buses go from hollywood boulevard and sunset boulevard to most places in la, and the train is close by too. the included breakfast is incredible value, with a variety of foods in all you can eat supply."

China,Female,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,8,10,"the location is pretty good. you can walk to some famous views. but it is not suit for someone who need a tight sleep. when i was there, there is a party outside until 2 o'clock, and the worst part is there are two guy chatting outside our room in 4.am. for a long time. it is horrible.  but others are good."
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed in two different hostels,usahostels in los angeles,and international hostel in san francisco.i prefer usahostels.1.you will have a instruction sheet of your  language,so you know everything.2.you bed is good,have a private space for you.3.you can charge the battery on you bed.4.there are some tour,you can join it.in a word,it´s a wonderful hostel satisfied all your needs."

Singapore,MixedGroup,25-30,6.9,8,8,10,6,4,6,6,"i woke up slightly later and i was chased out by the staff when i'm having my breakfast halfway bcoz they close the kitchen @ 10.30am. i find that they could have give some flexibility. laundry room only available after 1pm. they say that they have to clean their bedsheet. and we can't clean after 9pm or 10pm i think. i find this ridiculous. we are youth, we travel late night n want to do some laundry before we leave in the morning. both timing can't match. room carpetted, nt clean."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was awesome! the staff were so friendly and helpful. i had medicine that needed to be safely stored in a fridge and they were able to do this for me. lockers and power docks everywhere in rooms meant i always had a phone and camera ready to go. the vibe is very cool. lots of cool young things ready for a party any night of the week (staff included - which i love). 
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"really fun atmosphere, great for making friends and finding the best places to go."

France,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at the usa hostels hollywood. the hollwood area is very nice, there were activities organized daily, it was easy to mingle with people, clean and comfortable.  i would definitely come back to this hostel."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"it was overall a very enjoyable stay, close to everything a tourist would want and need!"
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,the staff weren't always polite compared to the other usa hostels i stayed in san francisco 
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,really  nice  place...  can't  complain  about  anything...
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,really helpful staff. i love that the toilet was always really clean and they have a lot of activities for the guests.
Finland,Female,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it is a great hostel, just too expensive for a backpacker on a world tour. 40 usd is just too much for a hostel no matter the service or location that's why i changed the hostel. otherwise they do everything right. especially the common area outside is very cozy and for example the power points for every bed is something that many any other hostel doesn't offer."
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,loud at night time. party hostel. not one for a quiet night!
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great hostel, right in between sunset blvd and hollywood blvd which is a key location.  the rooms are great with their own washrooms, although a bit humid air conditioning would be excellent instead of a fan. breakfast was great and so were the free hotdogs on fridays. the value for money for this hostel is great and the atmosphere is cool with a great front patio to chill and meet people. pub crawls were really good also."
Belgium,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great locotion, great staff!"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,10,6,4,10,"a very nice hostel right near hollywood boulevard. we had lots of trouble with inconsiderate room mates but that's not the hostels fault. moved us to a different room which was much appreciated. the female receptionist was a bit miserable but the guy with the glasses was very helpful and extremely polite! activities arranged were very good and reasonably priced. if you are looking for a party hostel at the weekends this is the place, if not sleep may be an issue for you!"
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, helpful friendly staff that couldn't do enough for you, clean and a safe place to stay"
Australia,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i like the building and the interior very much. the backyard is sensational. the location is not too close to the attractions but the neighbourhood is nice. it would be nicer if they have kitchen for guests like other hostels do. but it's good that the cafe opens until midnight. it's a shame they don't have 24 hours check-in policy, as my flight was delayed and was forced to find another accomodation in the middle of the night."
Singapore,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i've stayed in so far in my life. friendly staff and multiple daily tours/activities. huge patio by the front to chill and meet new people. 2 power sockets by the headboard for everyone and another 2 more in each locker for secure charging of electronics. the additional panel at the side of the head also shields stray light from reaching the eyes to ensure a perfect sleep. cheap all you can eat dinners costing $6 from spaghetti to cheeseburgers. large laundry room as well.
Taiwan,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,everything is so good at usa hostel hollywood! i will definitely choose it again!
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,"great hostel, great atmosphere and plenty of events to keep the sole traveller feeling connected."

Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,one of the best hostels i've ever stayed in. can't wait to come back 
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,4,8,8,8,8,"was a nice place to have a stay in los angeles. the area around the hostel was not as expected a very nice area. haven't really expected to see the end of the hollywood walk of fame in a ghetto. hostel was nice, each room has own facilities, machines for washing/drying, free breakfast and dinner for small fee. cleaning service comes in from time to time to block your facility from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., i really disliked that. they have a bar with music, but the music is definitely to loud in there."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. extremely friendly and supportive manner. kindly organised the shuttle bus and gave myself and friend some handy tips and information. there could of been more variety for breakfast. sometimes when i would go to breakfast there wasn't much to choose from, eg enough toast spreads."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my first time staying at a hostel and i truly had a wonderful experience. they have free tours going on almost every day, $6 all you can eat dinners, they host pub crawls, free beach shuttle, and everyone staying at the hostel was great too. it was just a truly wonderful experience for me in every way."
Argentina,Female,25-30,6.3,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,"the place is ok, staff is nice, location is good, but it's literally impossible to sleep in this place at night. when i stayed there, asian people woke up at 6 am and started making noises and rumagging around their luggage as if it was 9 am. at night, drunk teenagers came back from nightclubs at 3 am and started up love scenes with complete strangers at the door of our room, shouting their names from behind closed doors or leaving the door open. also, one of our bags disappeared into thin air."

China,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,"the staff are very friendly and the location is very nice, close to hollywood blvd. the wifi is also very fast, which made me so happy. one thing is that the sheets are not as clean as i thought, but i can understand; this is a hostel not a five-star hotel after all."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i've stayed in for sure!
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location and a great vibe, usa hostels la was probably the best hostel i stayed in whilst traveling through the usa. rooms (bunk beds) are large enough with large (and clean) ensuite bathroom facilities. kitchen area and common areas are also large and have a great vibe. staff were awesome as well. definately stay at this hostel if you want to socialise. i had a blast here and will be back!"
France,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"second stay in this hostel but just for one night this time. clean, secure, great location, nice staff, good breakfast (it will be perfect with yogurt and free milk)."
France,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel! the staff is super friendly and helpful, the rooms are nice and the bathrooms very clean! we only stayed one night, but there are plenty of activities you can enjoy while being at this hostel! this place would be perfect for someone arriving in the city while looking for a more permanent places. it's also a good place of you are staying a little bit longer to enjoy the trips they offer. we will definitely come back!"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,was a total new experience for me. staff amazing and the activities they offer are awesome

Australia,Couple,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"very clean, good atmosphere if there a good crowd in the common room. plenty of drinking games if you want to party but plenty of space to chill out. staff are very friendly and helpful! cheap drinks in the hostel bar are good aswell!"

Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"good location just off hollywood blvd. they offer tours, hikes, all sorts of trips.  beds have metal ""walls"" to give you some privacy. you also have a bed light and outlets right by your bed."
Brazil,Female,25-30,6,8,4,2,8,6,8,6,"the big problem was the neighborhood: a club and a parking - both make noise during the night like car alarm, music, drunk people close to the window."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very good place to stay while your in hollywood. staff is very helpful and the rooms are pretty nice. i stayed in a 8-bed-dorm and it was very big. that was nice. breakfast is good and location is great, only one minute from hollywood boulevard."

England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have been travelling for two months now and have stated at a number of hostels across australia and the us and this was definitely top. i was made to feel welcome by the staff, they couldn't do more, personal touches like arranging daily activities were good. very clean also. would def stay again and would recommend to all."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"really enjoyed my stay at usa hostels hollywood! i stayed in a 6-bed female dorm with ensuite and it was awesome- bathroom was always clean, as was the room (that might be because us girls were tidy, though). the staff were friendly and happy to answer any questions asked and the nightly ""all you can eat for $6"" meals were great. would definitely stay here again! "
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is in the middle of hollywood, and across the road from a great little mexican place. the hostel staff were very friendly, put on regular tours (we did the walking tour and it was a great way to see la and to meet people), and the outdoor lounges were always being used. we met great people and had a great time! for our last night we changed to a private room and were amazed to find that it was more like a hotel room! our own ensuite and air con and tv!"

Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"this is not a quiet hostel. i had never visited hollywood and had no idea what to expect, but being awoken by post office workers next door at 4am slamming truck cargo around until 7am was not fun. great place, if you're into the club "
England,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a great hostel. we had a great time here. we enjoyed some of their weekly events. the place was very clean. lockers had power sockets in them so you could charge things while your out/asleep, which we thought was a great idea! kitchen was good with really nice free coffee all day and a good free breakfast. unfortunately, we got the room right next to the front door and kitchen, so we found it difficult to sleep as it was very noisy, but other rooms may not have this problem."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really great on just about every level. among central hollywood hostels, banana bungalow wins in the ""character"" department, but now that i've found usa hostels hollywood i never intend to stay at b.b. again."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i can't fault this hostel is any way. the location in hollywood is great, the staff are lovely, breakfast was decent, security is high, it's clean, modern, has a bar and a nice patio out the front where meeting people seems to be easier than the shyest person could possibly imagine! and all this equates to an amazing atmosphere! if you're looking for a hostel near hollywood, definitely stay here!!"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a++ great staff!!!!
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved it, couldn't ask for more. really efficiently run hostel. all the 'extras' that you want as a backpacker are included. lots of activities."
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,i was quite impressed overall.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel with fun people. we only stayed one night on our way to coachella, but we caught a really fun pub crawl. clean and great for making friends. highly recommended!"
China,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel is in general awesome. nice staff , very helpful all the time. tiny kitchen but it's ok, we can manage cooking chinese food there .  clean bathroom which is very important to me - personally. :)     it is a good deal except for noise from the bar just next to the hostel. i heard noise around 1-2 am and police siren also."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"we stayed here last year and had a great time so we made sure to come back this year too! the staff are amazing, the location is amazing, the facilities are amazing. it was always clean and there was always an activity running that you could partake in. the only scary thing during this stay was that 2 hostel goers were robbed of money, passport and belongings so that put a little damper on things. i would still come back in a heartbeat though!"
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"quite simply the best hostel that i've ever stayed in anywhere in the world. everything is there, the staff are amazing, it's super easy to meet people if you're travelling alone, and trips, outings and pub crawls help you see everything. everything that the solo traveler would ever need, right there, and done really very well. fun bar upstairs with cheap beer, beer pong, and stuff going on. good breakfast and bbq/pasta nights."
India,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,8,6,6,"it is a bit smelly n noisy, noisy is fine but they can definitely improve on the sapcing and smell stuff."
Wales,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"free breakfast is epic-best there is! and location is not too bad-fantastic for area but between 2 metro stations so can be annoying if you have lots of stuff! security is amazing no concerns what so ever and the free bus to the beach was great too :) find it a little expensive for a hostel but you get what you pay for and it makes up for the price with the activities, peace of mind security and small dorms of 6 people with en suite bathroom. very helpful people on the main desk too :) thanks!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"amazing staff! super friendly and always there to help out. the free breakfast in the morning was a great addition, and just the basics you need to get going.  great that the hostel organised nights out, and also day activities. would definitely recommend this hostel and would also come back!"
Netherlands,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,good hostel at a very nice place but it is a bit expensive
Italy,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"hey! this hostel is the best! i have been there for 2 days, and then i decided to stay one more!  the staff is really cool, the location is awesome, and there is a great atmosphere. really clean rooms and bathrooms also!  thanks a lot. this is my first hostel review, because this hostel is the one that really deserves it!!"
England,Couple,18-24,8.3,6,8,8,8,10,8,10,"good place to stay if you want to be in hollywood. friendly staff, decent kitchen, free wifi and lots of tours and activities on offer. however could do with a communal bathroom or two, as waiting for a shower in the morning was a bit of a pain. would stay again."
Norway,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location and staff, and a lot of fun things going on!"
Canada,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,would rather they spend more money on cleaner sheets and less lumpy pillows. other than that 10/10.   a+++ will lodge again.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,6,8,8,10,6,8,10,very well ran and clean hostel with great features. only problem is it is very noisy at night so don't stay if you want to sleep!
Malaysia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"overall the hostel is great. great dorm, kitchen and location. there only suggestion i would like to give is please provide  a carpet in front of bathroom in each dorm so that there will be less""dirty wet footprint"" created around the room. ."
CzechRepublic,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,8,"eventhough its located just a few dozens meters from hollywood blv, the schrader blv itself feels a bit dodgy. its 10mins walk to metro. staff at reception are very kind and informative, but since there are many people staying, cant spend that much time talking to you; but they allow you to print a few pages for free! wifi is free as well. you can have pancakes for breakfast. hostel organizes a lot of trips around la. my room, 8-dorm/4bunkbeds was so-so-spacious, with lockers and personal socket"
Germany,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,it was very nice to stay there but very loud after 11 pm!!!
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"as an avid traveller who has stayed in 20+ hostels i have to say, i was impressed! the staff are extremely helpful, helping me by printing off maps, telling me the best things to do and even helping me find a place to stay in san francisco! there is loads of activities on such as free hikes, cheap bar and the location was only two blocks away from the subway, making it really easy to get around- this is honestly the best hostel i have ever stayed in!"
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, clean, good breakfast and nice staff. best place to stay in hollywood!!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,6,8,10,10,10,"very good hostel. not the safest location in hollywood, but when going out at night there's always a massive group so it's not really unsafe. they offer so many activities including hikes to runyon canyon and buses to santa monica which makes being a tourist around la much easier as it's hard to get around without a car. beautiful, safe, comfortable and secure rooms and a fun bar area with cheap drinks and fun staff for night fun."
Germany,AllMaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nice hostel with a perfect location between walk of fame and sunset blvd. showers are in the room and they have a party room. can recommend it.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"incredibly nice staff and the free breakfast, no. beds/room and great internet connection made it a great value for money."
Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,8,10,10,very nice hostel and perfect for staying in hollywood and la. they have a very nice bar where they offer cheap drinks. also the hostel organizes lots of activities - very easy to meet other travellers.
Japan,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff is very kind.i want to use it next time
Brazil,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"i love that this hostel  is located right next to hollywood boulevard, walking distance to everythnig. the staff was hit or miss for me, some were very helpful and cordial, some looked bored and a bit rude.  the hostel is quite noisy, even at 1 or 2 am. the rooms in the back are definetely quieter. however, it's kept clean, facilities are decent, beds are actually quite comfortable, individual lights and plugs are great and the breakfast is pretty nice for a hostel. i would recommend it."
Japan,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,everything good for me.  i think that i was able to stay at the best place by my first los angeles stay.
Wales,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel we've stayed in!!
England,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the private room was in the worst location, you pay a lot for a private room and you don't expect it to be situated next to the bar and stairs. good hostel but dumb room locations. so hard to get any sleep."
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything is excellent
NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,4,6,10,"some staff were a lot more surly than at other hostels i've stayed at. tours and excursions almost every day are a plus, and they turn the lounge into a bar in the evening. lockers with power points are a plus. not exactly a stand-out hostel, but it's functional."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved the staff they looked after my needs very well, i also got very drunk there and they looked after me! the limo cruise was awesome!! :d     so many activites. xxx well done"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"stayed here for one night at the end of my trip and was really impressed, about 100m from hollywood blvd which has heaps of bars, clubs, food and tourist attractions. theres a cool outdoor area you can drink and eat and they had a free bbq . decent sized rooms and a great atmosphere.   free pancakes in the morning as well!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"best, most well thought-out hostel i've ever stayed in."
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent, for sure!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,there are no bathrooms outside the rooms. it is not pleasant to share a bathroom with 7+ people and not having an option outside the room.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location!  we stayed at the banana bungalow first and moved to this hostel because they had a cheap bus transfer to their hostel in san fran but when we got there they told us they no longer do the bus. which was a bit annoying and messed up our plans a little. the staff were really friendly and breakfast was good. however i thought there was a better party atmosphere at banana bungalow.
England,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"well located, very helpful staff. my dorm was close to the lounge which had music to 1am every night so found it noisy."
Canada,Female,25-30,6.9,8,10,8,6,6,4,6,"good hostel. main complaint is the lack of soundproofing - the walls are paper thin, don't expect to get a great nights sleep. but the location is great if you want to be in the centre of the tourist hub, and the staff are friendly. the privacy screen on the bed, outlet and light right at the bed, and outlet inside the locker are fantastic (don't forget to bring your lock). clean washrooms and comfortable beds."
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here twice during our two month trip. facilities are fantastic, comfy beds, awesome breakfast, great bar and close to everything you need (buses, metro etc). the thing that really made it for us though were the staff - incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the area and if they didn't know something would go out of their way to find out. also, they remembered us from our first stay so it was like coming home!"
France,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,it was really nice to stay there
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,10,6,"good hostel, good location, amazing atmosphere for meeting people, drinking, etc.    cons: the room and bathroom were not so clean as the rest of the hostel. i think it should get cleaned everyday. other thing was that the laundry room was opened just from 1pm to 9pm, which is a very complicated time to be at the hostel if you want to go to a lot of places. specially in la that`s so huge and where takes so long to go to one place to another."
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"without doubt the best hostel i've ever stayed, the atmosphere is so good, the hostel staff are all so friendly, a lot of activities are arranged, the location is so good, just on the walk of fame with metro station nearby, and the bed is comfortable and also with free breakfast."
France,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"one of the cleanest hostels i've stayed in. great atmosphere and facilities, with a lot of activities. a great place to party and meet people, but where you can also rest if you want to. best breakfast i've ever had in a hostel/motel/hotel in the states."
USA,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,10,6,8,6,4,"the location is fantastic and the staff is super nice. the breakfast is awsome and you have pancackes! the cleanliness could be improved. they don't have towels (you have to rent them!), that never happened to me before in a hostel. they organise cool activities and have free shuttles to santa monica. it's a bit noisy on weekends.definitely not recommended for shy travelers."
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,perfect....
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"party hostel with its own bar, live muscians, beer pong, bbq's everynight, 40m off hollywood blvd, its a shame this hostel isn't somewhere more interesting than hollywood"
Germany,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,excellent facilities in a very goog location. it's quite a big hostel...
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"what a fantastic hostel!! great location. very clean, great facilities, great tour offers, and absolutely brilliant staff. they are very helpful and very friendly. i will definately be recommending this joint to all my friends who travel through la"
England,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,matt was very knowledgable on the hollywood sign tour. louis was excellent on service and charisma was very good on info i needed. all the u.s.a hostal staff where excellent hosts and i recommend this hostel for 2013 in los angeles.
France,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hotel very friendly staff
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"heaps of fun at this hostel...activities every day including  beer pong, pub crawls, tours and local musicians performing. met fantastic people here. the hostel made my experience in la great!!!"
China,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,best hostel i've ever stayed till now!
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,8,4,"they have a room right next to the front door where they buzz people in, it's right next to the stairs where people are stomping and running up and down, and opposite the kitchen. do not get it if you want to sleep between 2am - 8am.     also, doesn't seem like the bathrooms were cleaned often."
Italy,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the private rooms are really too small and not so confortable, expecially if you pay a price similar to some hotels."
England,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"i thought the security was excellent, staff told you from the start that everyone had to hold their keys up before being allowed into the hostel. this made you feel secure, that none of the homeless would be allowed to stray into the hostel. the staff were friendly, and some more knowledgeable than others, but if they didn't know they would point you into the right direction. some times they could have given a little more advice to other customers."
France,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,great hotel friendly staff
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"just the best hostel i've ever seen, or stayed at. top notch place with a great staff."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,6,6,6,6,8,"the hostel's good, but the area is quite sketchy."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,4,8,8,10,8,"this hostel is right in the middle of hollywood. how much you enjoy your stay will be effected by what that means to you. i found hollywood pretty gross but the hostel itself is perfectly fine. pretty big party culture which i enjoyed but was hard to avoid. facilities are nice and each room gets it's own bathroom which is real good.  good hostel, no complaints."
France,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"good staff, good value, good breakfast, nice hostel to stay just 5 min walk from hollywood boulevard and from one metro station to universal studio!!!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,10,10,8,8,4,8,i stayed in this hostel five years ago and it was much better then. smaller bar now and ridiculous noise issues. while we were there i was woken up by a fistfight right outside our room. no control was attempted of noise levels after 12pm. no sleep and regimented  (read rude)staff who cared little for the quality of peoples experience with the hostel.
Germany,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"it´s a good hostel, very safe, breakfast included, helpful staff and informations. offered tours are good ideas but not unfortunately not very good quality. it´s a big hostel, for that a bit impersonal and almost too strictly organized. but over all good value."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was sweet. very secure and very well organised. there was one night where a bunch of people came back drunk and woke everyone up - i didn't care though, that's just what happens at hostels. some other (older) people got pretty upset though. loved it though. seriously."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,10,4,6,10,staff was not friendly. my entire check out process happened without the staff speaking to me. very clean and safe!
Ireland,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wish i could stay there for 10 days in may , but i think they have a time limit"
England,Male,,8.9,10,8,8,10,10,6,10,"good value for money with a decent breakfast included in the price. secure hostel and the rooms, with a key card required for access to both, 1 large locker included felt a little flimsy though. a decent location with public transport quite near by, good if you want to see the tourist sights in hollywood. nice and clean, staff offer assistance when asked. overall i am happy with the accommodation."
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,nice breakfast. good location. lots of activities on offer. bunks not so sturdy - a lot of movement when someone rolls over. good wifi. laundry soap provided for decently priced washing facilities. nice staff 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,"location in hollywood is great. the bus to santa monica was really handy and the staff all very nice. we had to pay for the pubcrawl (not sure where that money went), but it was fun nontheless. all you can eat bbq was great. a bit exxy, but a nice place to stay."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"had a great stay here. very clean, comfortable dorms, a bar with cheap drinks if you want to stay in and very close to the heart of tourist hollywood. staff were helpful with tours and other inquires. i would definitely recommend staying here."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,my only negative comment is that the wifi is unreliable.
Australia,Male,18-24,8,6,10,8,10,6,6,10,"a few too many rules and a lack of character that you want from a hostel. less focused on meeting other travelers and having fun and more importance on clean, tidy modern facilities. resembled more of a school camp. would reccommend if you want a comfortable, quiet stay to break up the usual non-stop hostel life, but not if you want to party."
Chile,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"good: everything is just good!! really nice breakfast, great staff, the beds are so comfortable!!, they have a lot of activities everyday, the hostel is super safe.    to improve: the wi-fi conection is the worse i ever use in a hostel and also people from the staff walked in for ""room check""or ""bed inspection"" and didnt even knock the door and you could be naked (i was in a female dorm and was a guy who walked in)"
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,8,ok place to stay. nice breakfast.
China,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,4,8,6,10,wifi is really poor.
Australia,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great bar, dorms are good with ensuites.. just a minute from the star walks.."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"without a doubt the best hostel i've stayed so far! superclean, good location, great beds with privacy board, bedlight and power outlet, good and free breakfast, fun activities such as pubcrawls, free walking tours and free beach shuttles. staff is amazing, so much fun and extremely helpful, staff even hangs out there when not working, that shows how much they love their jobs! only thing that could be better is the wifi reception in some of the rooms. other than that, absolutely incredibly fun!"
China,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,2,6,8,6,8,"the location is scary, but inside is fine"
China,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,a lot of good tours arranged!  it was pretty noisy in the morning. and whoever talking in the hallway can be heard inside the room. i was woke up by the steps from upstairs.  bathroom in the room were good but in a 6 bedroom it gets demanding at times.
Wales,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i was here over christmas and had a wonderful time. the staff are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. there are lots of activities, an excellent free breakfast and cheap food each evening.   my room was spacious and i likes the personal light and privacy board. there are lockers with power points inside- genius."
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"location was great. right off hollywood blvd. walking distance to clubs, bars, and theaters. metro is only a few blocks away as well. driving is close to 101 holldwood fwy. parking is a bit challenging but certainly feasible. they had a comedy show sunday night that was pretty cool."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the free breakfast was amazing, those pancakes mmmmmmmm.  each bed having it's own power outlet and privacy screen is a very good idea, and also having the power outlet in the lockers is so handy!  the 'all you can eat' nights are cheap and tasty, hamburger and hotdog night is the best!  i'd stay here again for sure!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel is located footsteps from hollywood boulevard, metro station, tourist sights, bars and awesome food. security is great nobody without a swipe card can get in, awesome activities that enable you to meet people, free bbq nights, super friendly and informative staff..definitely recommend staying here if you're in la!"
Philippines,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,"the staff were friendly and accommodating. the pantry was complete. also, you get to have free breakfast everyday."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,10,6,6,10,this was a nice and clean hostel. met some friendly people. not a lot of people seemed to join the tours and activities provided by the hostel at the time so it wasn't lively enough when i was there. the location is perfect in hollywood. close to all the tourist attractions in hollywood area.
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"jamie and melie with just amazing hosts. they made my experience so much better with their tips as well as just fun to talk too. they help everyone with all sorts of requests like parking in good spots, how to do the laundry, how to make pancakes, chatting when having a drink, putting names on guest lists in hostels, etc. they are so much fun thank you for being the best hostel i have ever stayed in. cheers, dran from australia"
HongKong,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i have lived in so far. staff are so nice, and the location is perfect."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is awesome! i highly recommend it! location is just nearby hollywood with convinient transit. the staff, they re just superb!! everyone is friendly and helpful. basically you can ask them everything n they will find the answer for you! i appreciate their help! the room is clean too. there is only one thing. since its shared dorm, so not everybody is quiet and disciplined (yup!), so if u re a light sleeper, u d better bring a earbug or simply buy one at the vending machine at the place"
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"staff cleaning your room everyday. clean and goo kitchen. staff is very helpfull. lobby is so cool with ping-pong-beer, bar and tv's. good place to meet people and make friends. they have a lot of cheaper tours(everyday there is a different tour..bervelly hills walking tour, hollywood sign, pub crawl, 6 flags, free shuttle to santa monica beach), discount in nightlifes."
Australia,Male,25-30,4.6,2,8,6,2,2,4,8,"typical big hostel, treat you like a number. i had to ask specifically for a towel, they wouldn't print my boarding pass for me, even when i offered to paid. individual tables made it hard for a solo traveler to meet people.  bbq was 90% bun and 10% meat and salad.     basically a big, cost cutting corporation with the thinnest toilet paper i'd ever seen, inedible free pancakes, and free coffee so terrible nobody drank it coupled with a 10am check out!! def. wont be staying here again."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a really great stay here!! the hostel offered so many cheap or free activities!! every day was filled with activities and we could've even used an extra few days!! rooms were very good, power points in lockers and next to beds were great! very friendly staff, and delicious $6 bbq for dinner!! great place to stay, and area of the location is pretty good. thanks for our stay!! :)"

Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"the staff were very helpful and the hostel had lots of activities to do each day. the breakfast was excellent and very good value. prepared leaflets and map was very clear. perhaps there could have been a free shuttle to another place in la as opposed to just venice and santa monica beaches, as the buses are very slow and time consuming? the bar inside the hostel was playing music very loudly one night and a staff member frequenting the bar refused to acknowledge it or turn it down."
Greece,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,a very nice place to stay and enjoy the life of hollywood. the staff is very friendly and they very aware of the needs and particularities of hostel visitors. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to save some money from accommodation and spend it to the night life.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,"the staff were friendly, the hostel was average, i liked that they had laundry facilities and that they organised things for you to do while in town. i was only here for one night at the end of my stay in l.a but the time i spent there was decent."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,8.6,10,8,10,10,8,6,8,"the hostel is perfectly located, with access to virtually anything one could desire. the rooms are well-designed for space and economy, considering there are up to 8 beds in them and the beds include unexpected innovations like individual enclosed lamps for convenience &amp; privacy. the staff appeared to be overworked; they dutifully attended to tasks but with just professional politeness and without enthusiasm."
Australia,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,the location is good. easy to get to from the airport. pretty safe and exciting area. rooms were big and clean. beds a bit noisy. bar was ok - a bit quite. the hostel had atmosphere - pub crawl was ok. free shuttle to santa monica was awesome. beverley hills tour was ok - $12 is a bit expensive. staff were helpful and friendly. wifi was ok - not easy to stay connected. computer access was good - so was printing at reception. would stay again if ever in la.
France,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a wonderful place to stay if you visit l.a . as soon as i go to l.a i stay in this hostel, good location, friendly staff members,  just a good place to stay "
China,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,clean and great
Brazil,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,8,"i love the outlets inside the lockers and at the side of each bed. to be honest, there are outlets everywhere. you always can keep your devices charged. the staff is great and there are really fun activities everyday. i like the location, near the walk of fame and the subway station, although the neighbourhood didn't look that safe. the breakfast is poor, there are few bathrooms and the dorms are too small for that amount of people, but i will consider staying there again next time."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,this hotel is clean and near to the train station . receptionist there is helpful.
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very close to everything. friendly staff , great facility's &amp; very helpful &amp; safe. would recommend it to anyone"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this was such a cool and quirky hostel. it's in a great location right near hollywood blvd and the star walk of fame. they offer tours to the hills, the beach, beverly hills and lots more.     i had a great time staying here and met some really cool people.    would definitely stay here again!!"
Wales,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel was set out perfectly for people who wanted to interact. there was a really nice outdoor courtyard and an indoor bar and general party area. the hostel put on lots of things to do both day and night which was perfect for us. great staff and great hostel, would definitely stay again it's just a shame it's in la"
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel takes a lot of pride in their service, facilities and security.  they have thought of everything.   the rooms, with power-points to recharge phones and cameras in both lockers and right by your bed are fantastic.  they offer a lot of great tours and group activities."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,"this hostel was alright, it was really close to everything in hollywood. easy to meet other travelers. clean. there were lots of fun activities, but most cost money. a few more free/cheaper ones would be good.    my main issue was that i was given the worst room possible. it was right across from the kitchen, which means you're not sleeping past 8am. and the hostel was pretty empty yet they packed that room full, i have no idea why they couldn't spread us out more. otherwise good though."
Switzerland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel i have been until now!  frendly staff, good mattress (don't squeak), locker with outlet, light and outlet by the bed, good breakfast included, usualy cheap dinner availabel.    it's easy to meet new pepople in the common rooms and the bar.    i will defenitly come back if i visit la again."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel! for something located directly off hollywood blvd, for that price, i honestly wasn't expecting much, so i was very pleasantly surprised as it turned out to be one of the nicest hostels i've stayed in! spacious dorms, nice clean bathrooms, and it's nice that wifi was included - most hostels i've stayed at charge an extra fee. wifi was slightly unreliable though, occasionally dropping the connection, but quite decent overall."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, staff were awesome, good mix of travellers and they were really helpful"
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,usa hostels in san fran &amp; hollywood are defiantly you best option friendly staff great locations highły recommend both of them.   rian (ireland)
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,that guy roberto that shows people around was real cute/sweet. a+
Switzerland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i allready stayed 2 times in that hostel. its my favorite hostel and i would go back everytime! and believe me i stayed in many hostels all over the world!  if you are looking for party this is the right place. they also offer a free shuttle to venice beach and many other benefits like limo tour, pup crawl for little money and walking tours for free.  it is very clean and the staff is very friendly... good breakfast too!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"friendly staff and great atmosphere, lots of activities on offer and kitchen is great to cook your own meals!!"
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,"it is an excellent place because you are just in hollywood. it is very good located. in addition, the rooms are pretty clean all the time, they clean every day, that is perfect. besides i do like share the restrooms with the less amount of people possible and i did it in this hostel, one restroom in each dorm room, so i just have to share with maximum 6 persons including myself."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"good hostel, in a bit of a dodgy area tho, but that's hollywood. security of hostel good and good bar for drinking"

Slovenia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"the hostel is very good located, breakfast included in the price, very clean, they have a lot of activities offered for a good price. the location is appropriate for single travelers, groups or couples. one of the best hostels i was."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"if you want to stay in the heart of hollywood and share lots of beer with some friendly fellow travellers, you must come here. the upstairs bar and front courtyard are generally pumping. there is a group of local guys who will try to sneak in but they always get caught and asked to leave. the dorm rooms are fitted out well and bathrooms are clean. most of the staff are friendly and helpful but there are a couple of staff who could really do with a job not involving customers."
Mexico,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i'm traveling by my self so i was a little scare of not meet people, in my first night i went to the limo ride, it was so much fun and the guy was aweosome !!! my stay there was great... i met a lot of people, it's in the hearth of hollywood so you can walk everywhere, there are organized tours at day and night time, free breakfast!!! i have been in hostels around the world and i can say i would love to come back!!!"

USA,Female,18-24,7.4,8,10,8,8,6,6,6,"although i always saw the staff cleaning, almost all the time in every place as if staged, the pillow and mattresses have disgusting yellow and brown stains. you pass out clean linens? hard to believe since the beds are so nasty. otherwise the locations  was nice and the security was top notch. the location is good although far from downtown."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location in hollywood. nice breakfast with diy pancakes. free shuttle to the beach also a nice inclusion. very clean rooms with private pod style bunks.

Brazil,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,"upon arrival we were placed in a room under maintenance and small, but i contacted the reception and they found another room right away. close to the walk of fame and there were plently of activitives organized by the hostel throughout the week"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"pretty solid hostel, they organise plenty of things for people to do. location is ok, no such thing as a good location in la, overall clean, fun, and secure hostel."
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,the best!!!
Taiwan,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,nothing to be complained. perfect place to stay in la.

Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"close to shopping, food &amp; lots of major sites in hollywood. breakfast was outstanding! banana pancakes &amp; oranges started every day off great! free beach shuttle every few days was nice, though it filled up quickly.   staff could have been more helpful, but most were nice enough. rooms were cleaned daily and ensuite bathroom in the dorm was nice to have.   if arriving at lax book super shuttle in advance. they wouldn't take us without a reservation because it was offseason &amp; the cab was over $50."
Ireland,Male,31-40,8.6,6,10,8,8,10,8,10,possibily the best hostel in around hollywood... :)
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,4,10,8,10,8,10,"hey guys, great hostel and great location but the guest mail draw should have a lock methinks.  it'd make sense if you told people not to have important mail sent to the hostel but i did ring ahead and was assured it was fine.  in my case it ended up fine but only through complete coincidence.  otherwise i had a great stay :)"
Australia,Couple,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, great location.  hard to get much closer to the centre of the hollywood action.  would stay there again."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"usa hostels was a great hostel to stay at. it's located right in the middle of hollywood, staff are friendly &amp; helpful, great areas to hang out in. and they organise events almost everyday."
Turkey,Female,18-24,6.9,6,10,8,6,4,6,8,"it seemed a nice hostel, but i had a lot of troubles there. first, i joined a tour to hollywood sign and it was quite unnecessary to join. if you have a car, i definitely recommend you to go by car. there was an arrogant guide with us. although the tour was of 7 people, he left 2 of us behind while taking pictures. second, although i talked to someone at front desk about my early departure, since he did not take a record, i could not get my money back for it. finally dorm room was so hot!"
Poland,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"hostel's staff and all the activities make amazing atmosphere. for people who travel like me by themself it perfect place to meet new people. only thing is location , to get to a beach you need more less 1,5 hour. although definitelly recomend this hostel ."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.4,2,10,8,6,4,6,2,bed bugs!!! stay away .....
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.3,6,10,8,8,8,8,10,"great hostel. very big and easy to meet travelers from all parts of the world. great common areas, very clean. if going to la recommend highly"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,6,10,"really much better than i expected. last time i stayed in a hostel it was dirty and noisy. not the case here! i really appreciated the privacy screens on the beds and power outlets in locker. brilliant idea! the staff were not only welcoming but very informative. not sure that blasting music in the bar was such a great idea, the minute the bar opened. a playlist that starts out mellow and builds up the party atmosphere wld feel less like management is trying to make everyone go outside"
USA,MixedGroup,41+,6.3,4,10,10,6,6,6,2,hard beds you need to buy a dishwasher dishes not washed in extremely hot water are unsanitary.people there are way too loud couldnt sleep.overpriced.
Ireland,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel well run and good fun. highly recommended
Malaysia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel in hollywood!! love the funky happy atmosphere! the location of the hostel is pretty good, it's near to the walk of fame. the diy pancakes breakfast is so enjoyable! a lot of activities provided thru the whole week. the room is clean and provide individual light and electricity plug for each bunk beds. in additional, the shuttle bus to san francisco pick up point just in front of the hostel! it's so much convenient for us."
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,overall a great hostel. loved free pancakes in the mornings but need pans without metal handles. really like ensuite bathrooms in the dorms. staff were really friendly.

NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"nice hostel. rooms a good size.  need to have more activities, esp free ones. need more shuttles going to santa monica than what they have already.  room 104 is in the worst place!!! so noisy from all the people coming in the front door/hanging in the kitchen/coming down stairs. was woken up a lot with noise from people tramping up and down the stairs from the lounge and talking really loudly during 'quiet time (it was about 1am) in the kitchen. crc the security door - it squeaks really loudly"
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,absolutely loved this place! staff are great - very friendly and helpful! rooms are clean. there is always something to do here and the activities provided are great! they really try to ensure that their visitors have a great time.

USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i really did feel good there.  too bad i had to zoom off so fast.  the company i received was great, and i really needed to relax.  also, i felt fine going to check out some art openings in that area and returning late.  freedom was wonderful.  bar atmosphere was light and joyful.  the large tv to check out some late night comedy was fun.    thanks  from addine"
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"i had a really great time. staff friendly. cleanliness, secruity and location excellent!  you walk out the door and can see the hollywood blvd with all the stars (-:  i loved the free pancakes for breakfast and also the daily ""things to do"":   free shuttle bus, beverly hills walking tour with adam, free comedy night, ...  free internet for checking emails - awesome.  i was travelling a year in australia before so stayed in lots of different hostels before - the usa hollywood hostel is the best."

Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"only stayed there for one night, but seemed to be a really great hostel. very good: you can't come in until you show your key."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"maybe the most organized hostel i've ever been to, and i've been to a few. they have events every day, cheap beer at the bar and is steps away from hollywood walk of fame. also it's very clean and full of good people, don't let those pictures get you down."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel if you are by yourself. they have activities across fr om the receptionist that you can sign up for each day of the week. stay here but never ever stay in santa monica hostel cuz they are against alcohol even though they post about beer crawls, an lil mellow drunk girl ready to pass out in bed will be kicked out and arrested. they have a great drinking area in this hollywood hostelbs and nice fun partying. limo ride to for bar crawls too. comfortable beds too :)"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"loved the unlimited pancake breakfast, good kitchen, great staff and good location. what more could you want? maybe aircon, it gets pretty hot in there and with the windows open you hear the revellers and homeless people occasionally (especially on a friday and saturday) but"
China,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"niec！the location is perfect,this is the best hostel i ever lived expect the  rental is a little expensive."
Malaysia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,6 bedded female room is better than 8 bedded female room because there is only one shared bathroom.
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"just few steps to the walk of fame. the staff are warm and friendly. in addition, i love the small kitchen. in one word, it's an awwwwesome hostel. btw, cash is cheaper than card..they will not tell you that."
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,its easy place. near of metro and hollywood. there are nights clubs near. the hostel is organized.
England,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the hostel is in a great location next to all the clubs in hollywood, but i'd recommend brining ear plugs as it was pretty noisy on the nights that i needed an early night... definitely recommend this place though"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"great hostel - good atmosphere in the beer pong room.  only critique would be the excess security levels with the card system - i understand you guys dont want outside people sneaking into the hostel, but if you have just handed me the entry card and then i walk 2 metres to the door i would imagine there is no need to ask to see it again - but besides this it was really a nice place to stay"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a great place to stay. great activities offered. i found it a really easy place to hang out at and feel comfortable. would highly recommend to anyone. fantastic location!!!!

Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. great hostel to meet people especially if you are traveling solo.
Argentina,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i stayed here for two nights. the staff is amazing, very helpful and full of life. they are always running different activities as well as offering food at very reasonable prices. the kitchen is fully equipped but a bit small for the number of guests. the rooms and restrooms are very clean and they provide sheets and towels at no cost. i number of guests per restroom might be a little off but i didn't really have to wait to long anytime i needed it. great experience!"
Germany,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"i only had one night here, but i really liked it. location is great, in the middle of hollywood lots of cafes, shops around. beds are comfy and the private screen is great, shower was excellent, bathroom clean. they have a nice patio outside the hostel and a little ""bar"" area as well. lots of activities every day, so good to meet new people if you are traveling by yourself. the staff was very nice too. music in the common areas is a bit loud during the day tho."
China,Female,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,6,6,8,8,"basically, i think the hotel is good , location, cleanliness, security...  paper currency must be prepared , because the coin is refused and there are visa machine fee if you pay by visa."
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,"decent hostel, good location, but again a little pricey..."

Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very good hostel! the staff is really nice, the activities planned are really good, the shared environments (patio, lounge and kitchen) are really clean and comfortable. no wonder why so many people were trying to check-in on that weekend..."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"really clean, an amazing kitchen area, good activities and very secure. location is great just between hollywood and sunset blvd. i was with friends, but i can see it as being good for single travelers too as there are a bunch of activities to do to meet the other guests."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i stayed at in america. staff were really good and friendly. the common room upstairs in the evening was a very easy way to make friends as its a very sociable hostel with backpackers, not people living there. the hostel puts on good activities as well."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is great to stay at, the dorms are clean and tidy, the power points in the lockers and near the bunks are great. the breakfast is good (you can cook your own pancakes) and they have dinner every night for $6. the staff are great, really helpful. they do good tours, the one in beverly hills was very interesting. this is a very social hostel and the staff are good about letting you play drinking games in the patio. would definitely stay here again."
China,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,the breakfast and all-you-can-eat are so good!
Canada,Female,31-40,8,6,10,8,8,10,8,6,overall had a fine stay.  i think lower occupancy rooms would have made stay better.  with 6 people coordinating bathroom use it was very inefficient.  the rooms got quite hot and the ceiling was not always adequate off cooling down the room.  the lounge and activities were good.  breakfast was great.  i think a fresh coat of paint especially to the exterior would dramatically improve the appearance.  staff were very helpful
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,"easily one nicest hostel i've stayed at. it's a small place so it was super easy to make friends and feel at home. bobby, one of the managers runs a weekly snorkel trip where you get to swim with wild seas!! it was crazy memorable!!! such a sweeeeeet place :) an ideal hostel."
Taiwan,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,it's nice and convenient

Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i just got back from l.a. and i had an amazing time there! it was my first trip by myself and i'm very picky, so i was a little worried about how clean and secure a hostel would be. anyway, i was very happy about the service. very clean room and bathroom, free towels, nice covers.. and there are lots of activities that the hostel offers, which is an easy way to make friends. i loved l.a. too, incredible city! very busy place and  really hot."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,highly recommended for the student traveller! fantastic location and very friendly and helpful staff! :)
Canada,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,8,8,6,4,6,beds are so uncomfortable.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was great...idea of a personal light is great...however, raising the bottom bunks up so high makes it hard to sit on the bed without hitting your head on the bunk above, makes you hunch over to sit. security is great...they make you show the key before buzzing you through the door. breakfast was great too, make your own pancakes."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"the hostel is very good. its ideal for single travelers as they arrange activities for every day.    only downside, no air on in rooms though you won't notice it except in peak of summer.    the other was hollywood in general is not as clean as you'd think but that's beyond their control.    overall recommend it. plenty of power plugs to recharge your devices, wifi pretty good, had good laundry facilities easily get to train/metro."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the second i arrived i was greeted with the wonderful friendly staff. the rooms are great. the room i stayed in was to the rear of the hostel and i had no noise complaints at all, even with two clubs next door. if you are a light sleeper be warned because the bass coming from the clubs could be disruptive. if you are concerned with security there are lockers to keep your things in, i didnt make use of the lockers however.  the kitchen is well equipped. everything was just amazing!"
Iran,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,i enjoyed my stay very much
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,8,10,"we only stayed one night at this hostel, but i was impressed by the clean modern room &amp; the comfortable beds. we did not use the breakfast room, but it did look nice as i passed by in the morning. i also noticed many sign-up sheets for sightseeing trips &amp; tours offered by the hostel, including a beach shuttle, all for cheap prices and some of them even free! if i had stayed longer i definitely would have taken advantage of these. the location is also ideal! stay here, you won't be disappointed."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"usa hotels hollywood was a great place to stay.  extremely clean, very secure with large lockers and two power points inside the lockers and friendly staff.  there were also a number of activities run by the hostel and a fully equipped kitchen.  wireless was not always stable but a fantastic location and overall, a good place to stay.  definitely recommended."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a very clean hostel rightin the centre of all the attractions! perfect location.
Turkey,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really liked it, one of the best ones i've stayed so far!"
Egypt,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,i think the everyday activites must be done as doubles in mornings and evenings because there will be a very big waiting list for those who signed up late and the wouldnt have the chance to do it.  the kitchen closes so early for me i guess because i like to have snacks after midnights but it is already closed  in pub crawls places must be picked carrefuly because i signed for one supposed to reach a club but when we reached a place without even a dance floor so i had to walk tomthe hostel !!
Ireland,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"very impressed with this hostel! i had looked at others around the same location but decided to pay that bit extra for this one and it was definitely worth it! very clean and very secure, the 'privacy pods' are a fantastic idea and the free shuttle buses that were offered were much appreciated, as were the 'all-you-can-eat' bbqs and breakfast. i would definitely stay here again!"
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,"really good service. quality breakfast, spacious and functional kitchen and awesome lounge area. too bad hollywood is ghetto."

France,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,8,8,10,8,8,friendly welcoming and well organized hostel. pancakes to be self made proposed for breakfast was nice!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,the staff were particularly great - i left a small electronic device in my hostel room and they were more than happy to locate it and then arrange for it to be posted to me!  generally quite comfortable otherwise - the privacy pods very useful. a larger variety of breakfast foods would have been nicer.
Brazil,Female,25-30,6.6,8,6,8,8,2,8,6,the facilities and location are great..... but the staff are not very helpfull at all and quiet unfriendly....its a shame!
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great hostel! i particularly liked the ""privacy pod"" with two power outlets, lamp and shelf and the all-you-can-eat make-it-yourself pancake breakfast. excellent location, very close to the main attractions at hollywood. free towel and bed linen. security is great, you must show your key to the desk staff to get in, also there are power outlets inside the lockers. would definitely stay there again."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,"loved this hostel. everyone was very friendly and the staff and roommates were awesome. only slight issue...the guy that was showing our new roommates to our room never knocked before he came in. we would've appreciated that. but overall, we loved it here"
HongKong,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"i stay an overnight here for flight transfer only. but the bed is well equiped as there are bed headlight, charge plugs around each bed and a small platform to put your watch, mobile etc, excellent!  also you can make your own pancake for breakfast and jam, bread &amp; drinks are served by yourself, not bad. and it is close to a disco and maybe i arrive on a sat night, everyone is in mood of partying. generally its quite good!  especially there is a hostel private post box for postal, great!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"i will always go to usa hostels first in la. it was one of the best i have stayed in my 15ish countries that i have visited and i will certainly been trying the others in the us when i visit.  thanks for a great, secure and reliable stay."

Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great location and staff, but because of the location it is quite busy and can be noisy as there is a nightclub two doors down"
China,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"it is good, but compared with usa hostel in san diego, i prefer the latter. actually, i think the room is a little bit small.... i feel a little bit disappointed when i first enter in(it's my first hostel experience in my life).. but it is really fun to meet a lot of people there.. everyone is friendly!"

NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,it was a nice hostel but rooms had no air con which was terrible. good location in hollywood but pretty expensive for what you get. a drinking water filter would be good. don't bother looking for a party here if you're under 21.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"it's kinda cool.. cool people. very very stricked on showing your key, which can get a but annoying but i guess they gotta do it..apart from that i enjoyed my stay"

Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,very central to everything but if you're a light sleeper then better to know there's a club next door in the car park and you might have trouble getting to sleep. i didn't mind too much.
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,great place:)

Italy,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel in hollywood/la by far!
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,4,6,10,8,8,4,8,"a good hostel.  i'd have preferred to have had better wi-fi, and a staff member didn't try the common solution of reseting the router when i suggested it, which usually improves connectivity.    if i have any issue, though, it's that the commons area doesn't encourage much socializing.  tables are small, giving a cramped atmosphere where big groups of people can't really converse and make new friends.    it doesn't help that it costs twice as much to stay here as it does at otherr nice hostels."
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,6,4,8,10,8,8,"hostel is in a dodge area of hollywood- during the day followed back to hostel, have never been asked for money so often  i would stay elsewhere in la say santa monica and spend half a day in hollywood to one day and then leave    once in the hostel it was nice"

Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is one of the best hostels i have ever stayed in and i have stayed in a lot! not only is it clean, with comfortable beds and lots of power points, it has an awesome vibe. the courtyard is the perfect place to hang out after a long day sight seeing and make some great new friends. the hostel events and ""all you can eat"" dinners are excellent value and so much fun! do the limo tour! i love usa hostels!!"

Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,8,2,8,"i was in a room near the door that leads to the dorm area.  for security, everyone needs to be buzzed into the dorm.  this was incessant and made it difficult to sleep.  there was extremely loud talking/arguing going on all night which wasn't policed effectively and kept me up . that was the biggest problem. the floor in my dorm was very noisy  and made a huge crash whenever someone jumped off their bunk. do not stay here.  i left after one night.  just awful."

USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,a friend and i had a fun stay over memorial day weekend in one of the six-bed mixed dorms. we booked at the last minute and were pleased by how convenient the location was to many of the major sites and train stations in hollywood. staff were welcome upon arrival and helpful when planning activities around the city. i would recommend this hostel to others looking for budget-friendly accommodations!

Argentina,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,6,10,8,10,10,"great hostel, though not in the best area (hollywood itself is dirty, not very very nice, and very far from the beach, downtown or bh).   they are pretty tight on their security access to the dorms area, not so much to the patio.   lots of fun activities planned that you can sign up for for very little money and a good chance to meet people if you are introverted as me and travelling on your own.   they have free breakfast (make your own pancakes and toast) and everynight dinner partys for $6."
Colombia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,it is a clean mid-size hostel in the heart of hollywood. breakfast is kinda simple...i'd add at least free milk+cereal. stuff were excellent.

Finland,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"usa hostels hollywood has a great location near hollywood sights and public transportation (metro red line). it's a very nice hostel except that there are too many too strict rules, e.g. only water is allowed in dorms, no other food/drinks."

Syria,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,i was so impressed by the facilities this hostel offers ..the atmosphire was amazing and the staff were friendly and helpful
England,Female,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,6,6,4,8,tacky and unsafe location. lack of community.
Malaysia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place to stay and well situated near the hollywood boulevard. only problems were that the wifi does not reach the end of the hostel so some rooms may not have access and also noise levels being higher than i would've preferred. guess that's dependant on your luck : when you stay and who you stay with. overall a pleasant experience though!
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"i've stayed in tons of hostels around the world and i'd have to say that this is one of the best. awesome staff, rad activities and a sweet bar with live music and comedy you guys really knock it out of the park. ill be back next time i'm in town for sure."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,would definately stay there again!
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"das beste hostel, in dem ich jeh war!!! das fuehstueck war fantastisch und die mitarbeiter unbeschreiblich nett und hilfsbereit. ich hatte nur drei tage in los angeles und dank den angeboten des hostels und der hilfe der mitarbeiter wurden diese drei tage unvergesslich! das hostel war immer super sauber (kueche, bad...) und ich habe mich sehr sicher gefuehlt. der preis ist zwar hoch, aber es ist auf jeden fall wert, ein paar dollar mehr zu bezahlen."
Austria,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"thank you guys for making me feel so welcome.  it was so much fun to hang out with you.  whenever anybody of you wants to come to austria, feel free to pop by ;)"

NewZealand,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is one of the best hostels i've ever been to. the staff are really helpful and friendly and the daily tours are great value. a big thanks to bob who took us on the ""pub crawl"". it was really awesome."

Brazil,Female,18-24,3.4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,rude staff.
India,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"it is situated in hollywood with just a 10 min walk to the chinese theatre, madam tussaud's and ripley's believe it or not. they have a kitchen facility where every morning the staff at the hostel prepares batter for pancakes and so you could prepare yourself a yummy breakfast of pancakes with syrup in less than 5 mins. they also provide fresh fruits, cereals and coffee.  it is very clean and hygienic and the staff is extremely friendly. the hostel had a very lively atmosphere."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,8,4,8,8,the hostel is in a great location and is clean and well looked after.  atmosphere with other travellers was great.  the staff however where very strict with the security and at times were rude even to their own guests.  this definitely needs improvement.
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,usa hostels are some of the best in the states..also stayed at usa in san fran not booked through hostelworld so i cant review it but also amazing. heaps of events to get everyone to meet and make friends. clean. loads of security.
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,6,10,8,10,8,nice place in a kind of crippy neighborhood. a lot of homeless and drunk people walking on the street.   but it is still a good place do stay.
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel in the perfect location. all very clean with huge lockers. awesome activities, free pancakes for breakfast and free wifi. had a fab time!"

Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,of all the hostels i stayed in this was easily the best.
SouthAfrica,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"everything about the hostel is great, they exceeded my expectations. the staff is awesome and the location is great too."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really good hostel. had no issues for the stay. multiple activites organised like shuttle bus to beaches, walking tour, pub crawl etc. staff were awesome in answering questions too."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,loved the atmosphere and the people staying and working at the hostel mede me feel right at home. the aim of the hostel seems to be to make sure everyone has a great time there and meet great people which i certianly did. room was a bit stuffy but i had a few drinks so slept right through!
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was by far one of the best hostel experiences i've had so far.  this place is cleaner than most fancy hotels i've stayed in, the location is excellent and it offers daily cheap (and tasty) food... oh, and the staff is just amazing. would definitely come back!"
USA,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,it was an ok hostel. was caught by surprise at the cost of parking...but i should have looked closer. i felt rather unsafe going back and forth from the parking after hours though.
Colombia,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,6,10,"is  nice place, staff is great and friendly, but i really prefer small hostels when is easier to the guest to become close."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i enjoyed my stay at usa the free breakfest was amazing, just like the hostel."
France,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"very good hostel, just next to hollywood boulevard, the kodak theatre, and the chinese theatre. very clean, cool staff members. only deffect : the breakfast. no milk nor orange juice, and the choice was quite poor."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,8,10,"very well organised hostel with great facilities and lots of activities. easy enough to meet people, and everyone enjoyed the breakfast. located in hollywood, easy walk to train station, but a long way from the beach if that's what you are looking for. the surrounding area felt a little seedy at night, but it's not to far to great places."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"the hostel was acceptable enough, albiet rather expensive given the quality of accommodation and facilities - the rooms were tiny and the lack of secure luggage space was a bit worrying. i've backpacked around australia where i've received much better backpacker accommodation for a similar price (for about $40 you get a single room and the facilities are much newer, with flat screen tvs, large lounges, pool t). maybe this is how it is in la, who knows but i wouldn't say i was terribly impressed."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,8,2,2,8,worst hostel i have ever stayed in!!! (and ive been around teh world) the staff were the most unhelpful people i have ever met. we arrived really late and didnt have us dollars on us and they wouldnt even hold our bags while we went to an atm! we asked lots of questions about different places and some of the responses were 'i dont know' 'ring them yourselves!' also the place has so many rules that its worse than high school. would not reccomend it at all.
Argentina,Female,18-24,4,2,6,6,4,2,4,4,"the staff was very rude to me, and to many others. they wouldn't help you with directions and facilitating your move arounds.  it wasn't entirely clean, the wifi connection sucked!!!!"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,"would definitly come back, because fun its garanteed and people are very nice!"
Brazil,Female,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the hostel have party every day until 4 am, it is very difficult to slep there, hollywood isnt a safe place for woman, who travel allon. the staff the hostel aren't helpful and the most are umpolide. i dont recomend stay here, only if you like the party. the shuttel service just bring you to the beach you have to como back by bus, that take more 2 hours. the hostel is far to the airport, it is better you stay in the downtown.."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wonderful! so many great daily activities organised by the hostel.
Canada,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,10,"comfortable beds, very secure. nice to have bathroom in the room and a light with every bed. staff was ok. did no think the hostel had a lot of character."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,10,8,"great location, free wifi, cool social events and big lockers in every room. i would stay there again."
Ireland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel great staff,great location could not ask for more,comedy night is a great touch!!!"
Austria,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,6,10,"a nice, bigger hostel in hollywood. rooms are clean, bathroom was one of the nicest i ve seen so far in hostels. the area is not the best, but thats just hollywood. a lor going on in the neighbourhood at night."
Thailand,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,10,10,8,8,the staffs were great and the maps and information sheet provided were really helpful!! pancakes in the morning were great too. the only complain i have is that my bed wasn't made when i arrived. it was like i had to get into a messy bed that someone had just gotten out minutes earlier. felt kinda yucky...
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i gave this hostel full marks this time.  i've stayed at this hostel before and i enjoyed it, i liked the staff, but i had major problems with the wireless internet on my previous visit just like everyone else at that time.  it seems they have got it right now and there were no problems with it at all this time.  rock on, guys.  ""cat"" is my fave.  she totally looks out for me.  but they all do.  they work hard at this hostel and you get that feeling that everyone cares about the place."
NewZealand,Female,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"loved the fact it was so close to hollywood walk of fame, so easy to get round with public transport. also liked the hostel meals for $6 saves cooking."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,6,6,8,10,staff should be a bit more friendly
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,4,8,6,6,8,6,8,"if your looking at this hostel cause youve stayed in one of the other usahostels and loved them, look down the road to banana bungalow right now! i constantly felt like i was being ripped off at usa, they charge for all the pub crawls, no one ever offered me a free beer like in other usa hostels and the parties were none existent. some staff were amazing and others rude, didnt like their security system. if you want to go to the bath room and someones in yours already, theres no where else to go"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,4,"i love the staff and the organization of the events, but the cleanliness was not ok...a lot of things around the room floor...i know that the staff didn't put that there, but they didn't remove either...most of the time the room was very...i mean very hot!!! not ok with that!"
Canada,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,amazing location!  very friendly environment and great value for your money.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,excellent location! staff are nice and helpful and helped us to book a shuttle back to the airport even though it was less than 24hrs before the booking time. the rooms on the left can hear the music that comes from the club across the carpark but its not too bad. the power points in the lockers are great and the showers had good water pressure. would definately stay here again :)
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,good location right near the heart of hollywood. staff were a bit hit and miss. some were fantastic others were a little less friendly. security was a bit on the crazy side of over the top but at least you were safe and secure. i have recommended this hostel to friends. quite good without being fantastic.
England,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"visited during an aussie breeding season this is another stellar addition to the usa hostels range though it needs to play catch up with san francisco!    good staff, always on hand in the communal facilities...the kitchen/dining area in particular seemed their favoured place to play hooky from work and lament management. also the excellent laundry facilities ($2.50 for wash+dry) never failed to contain 2 staff members hitting on each other, i always wondered why they close it off at lunch time..."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this was my first experience in a hostel (female, traveling solo). usa hostels hollywood was great! i would recommend to anyone. the rooms were a little hot at night (january) and it's located right next to the post office (which loads up their big trucks at about 6am..loudly) but honestly, it wasn't that bad at all. location fantastic, easy access to metro. security was excellent, and very clean. people were awesome. the hostel organizes lots of activities and opportunity to be social."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,one of the best hostels i've stayed in.
Canada,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"every good thing they say about this place is true from the great staff to a location that can't be beat.  they are tough on security which gives that extra comfort level.  however, i only gave an average score for facility because (although the facility itself is fine) the wi-fi is useless everywhere in the building except for a spot where everyone crams together near the soda machines.  this was bad.  internet communication are extremely important for travelers. wi-fi signals are easy to fix."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,great staff and a great location if you are keen on checking out hollywood. not such a good location if you are interested in checking out venice beach and santa monica as they are about a 2 hour bus ride away. i would stay again.
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"a lot of tours,great"
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"usa hostels hollywood is great, i don't have any complains."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have stayed in some of the best hotels and motels across the country including hyatt etc. this, however was the best in terms of total package. the location was excellent right in between hollywood boulvard and the sunset strip, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, making it easy to get around. great way to meet people and the tours and facilities were excellent. very impressed"
Chile,Female,31-40,6.3,6,8,8,8,4,6,4,"i stayed previously in usa hostels san francisco (same chain) and i really liked it, so i though the one in la must have same standards of quality, but definitely not. the staff was not that helpful( the asian girl in the front desk not friendly at all),when i arrived there they gave me sheets which supposed to be clean but guess what  they were full of hair and dirty, so i went back to the front desk and ask for new ones, luckily this time were clean.the location was good."
India,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,what i love most about this hostel is that they have several in-house acitivites that urge people to interact as well as head out together. that's very important for people who're travelling alone and are looking for travel buddies.
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is an exellent place. impecably clean. excellent location. friendly staff. i very highly recommend it.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's a fantastic place to make friends, have fun and a great base from which to see la.  every night dinner is available for around $6,  fun events go on in the lounge and tours are available every day to see something of interest in la. clean, great staff, safe and secure. i'd stay at usa hollywood every time."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"really good place to be if you want to see hollywood...in la you stay where you wanna go, so hollywood is a must, and this place has you sorted. pancake breakfast and the cheap dinners are great. some more vegetarian options and morning coffee would make this place even more amazing."
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"so friendly staff and great location. on jan. 6th,2011,i saw lucy liu ! that night, the tv show ""southland"" was shooting on that street ,10 meters from this hostel!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"excellent overall hostel, awesome free/cheap tours. helpful staff and top location. each shared dorm has a single shower/toilet which is ok but awkward when 4 people need to shower at once. really good vibe, a beer pong table and cheap beers - what more do you want?"
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love it!!
Austria,Male,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,best but also most expensive hostel i have ever stayed.
Australia,Male,18-24,8,6,8,6,8,10,8,10,hostel is was sweet - met some great people...
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,2nd visit in as many years. owners always improving the standard of living at usa hostels. most impressed! 
Taiwan,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's really a nice place to stay, staff are very friendly and funny, i am very happy i made a right choose"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,10,6,10,8,"a nice hostel, right on hollywood blvd so there's heaps of stuff to do there. the people i met there were cool, some of the staff weren't that friendly and seemed to think because you had the piece of paper they gave you upon arrival, you would automatically know everything about the place and not have to ask them any questions...but anyway other than that its an awesome place to stay in la."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"not cheap, but everything is clean and nice!!!"
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"the cubby beds were amazing, the lockers were massive and had plug sockets in them :) -awesome. the security is pretty good (in terms of who can get inside the hostel). the communal areas were heaps of fun and they even have a beer pong table which def brings travellers together :) staff were really nice esp johnny, he's lovely :) would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,6,8,"a well located hostel that lacked a bit in atmosphere, but i was still able to meet other travellers there. they provide activities, but 2 were cancelled while i was there. the bar upstairs gets going a bit after dinner and they have cheap drinks, beer pong, comfy couches and tvs. the beds in the dorms are quite good as they have a little privacy wall, shelf, light and power socket. they also have decent lockers in the rooms but you need to provide your own (big) lock. our room was noisy."
Germany,Male,18-24,7.4,6,6,10,8,8,6,8,"the hostel was pretty expensive, but i feel that hostels are generally more expensive in the us than in europe. the staff was welcoming and everything was clean. we were told not to leave any valuables in the room unlocked but there were no locks provided. we were told to that we could buy one at the front desk and then they were out of locks and it was christmas and we couldn't buy any. honestly, either you provide locks or you have enough to sell."
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"usa hostels are definitely the best in the us. very friendly staff, they offer day trips around la. hollywood at night can be dangerous but with a few steps from the hostel you have stars under your feet!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"good vibe and character, and location is pretty good. maybe a bit more choice for breakfast would be nice but very happy with the hostel"
Germany,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"good, clean hostel."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,8,8,"i really enjoyed staying at usa hostels hollywood. the place was very clean and friendly, albeit slightly disorganised, but it had everything you need in a hostel, same as its san franscisco counterpart! the airport shuttle was very good also. the location was as good as can be expected in los angeles, which is a complete pain to get around."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,10,8,6,6,8,8,10,"friendly place and nice staff. the privacy corners on the beds were great. ensuite bathroom shared between 8 girls meant some long waits for the shower, but it was clean. pancakes basic but yummy. a bunch of aussie dickheads spent most of one night drunkenly shouting and running up and down the hallways; staff tried to tell them to keep it down after about 2am with little success - not exactly their fault, but in some other hostels i reckon they'd have been kicked out. still, good times."
Netherlands,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,i can't think that it was n excellent stay
India,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"very good hostel, one of the staff was unfriendly, everybody else was nice."

Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,everything except location was excellent by hostel standards and social atmosphere was fantastic! location was not perfect but the hollywood area is an interesting part of la
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"staff were really helpful and nice, location is perfect for the hollywood tours. only slight negative is that they play music till 11pm sometimes but they always turn off. i would definitely stay again."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,staff is awesome!! too many guys in the hostel when i came lol .otherwise quite good.
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"a group of 3 of us stayed here for 2 nights in mixed 6 bed room.   pros: freek breakfast that includes unlimited pancakes, coffee &amp; tea, good wifi connection throughout hostel, very close to hollywood sights, showers in room good, communal area with bar is awesome &amp; has some cheap drinks, friendly helpful staff that had a lot of knowledge.  cons: kitchen shutting for cleaning right after breakfast finishes us a bit inconvenient.  this is party hostel, would recommend staying here, will stay again"

Australia,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,8,0,10,10,8,great hostel. amenities were very sufficient. kitchen was large to accommodate all guests. only problem we had was the cancellation of the beach shuttle bus however staff provided adequate information on how to get to the beach.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay, although not for long as hollywood can get old."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,"at first, it was hard to find here, but finally we found out the location of this hostel is wonderful. staffs were all very friendly and there was a party upstairs ;) also, here is very clean :)"
England,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i had a brilliant time at this hostel and made loads of new friends thanks to the lively and social environment. i loved all the trips and activities that were planned and the kitchen (with free tea and coffee) and the privacy pods were an added bonus! a lovely place to stay :)

China,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great organisation. i asked for a silent room, it's far from the lounge, so i slept well all 3 nights. everyone in my room respect the others, so no noise after 11pm, we keep clean our room...  i really apreciate that we can have good wifi everywhere. every morning i wake up with the good smells of pancake...  we could share our travel experiences with others, there is excelent atmosphere"

NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,4,10,10,"there was a girl that was on staff that was really rude to me and my friend, she needs to seriously reconsider her attitude towards guests and she also over charged us when we left a few bags in the bag store (charged us for four days when we were only leaving them for three, then argued with us when we asked why she was charging so much)"
China,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the facility is very conventient and the staff is so nice. but the wifi is not easy to get the ip.

Canada,Male,25-30,9,0,10,8,0,8,10,10,"this is a great hostel for people traveling on their own or groups interested in meeting other people because the hostel activities (limo tour, hollywood sign tour, walking tours, pub crawls, etc) are well attended and reasonably well promoted within the hostel."

Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great hostel, big enough to offer heaps of activities and tours everyday aswell as good pubcrawls and night life. about 100m away from hollywood boulevard. the only downside is la´s terrible public transport system but this cant be atributed to the hostel. great hostel. recommended.  internet is expenisive but lots of computers provided"
Canada,Male,31-40,8.3,0,10,8,0,10,8,8,"nice spaghetti dinner &amp; bbq nights for $6.  the privacy screens around each bunk are great!  they have a light &amp; power outlets, plus a little shelf.  very convenient.  :-)  the staff are fabulous, especially the evening shift.  the place feels like a university dorm.  security is very tight as you have to show your room key every time you enter.  bed is quite comfy!  only major complaint is no quiet area to lounge.  lounge turns into bar and patio is for smoker's and is cold this time of year."

Australia,Female,25-30,8,0,10,8,0,6,8,10,fairly good hostel... no complaints.. staff weren't overly friendly but the location is good and there's pancakes you make yourself for breakfast every morning which are delicious!!!
Germany,Female,31-40,7.3,0,8,8,0,6,4,10,"the location is very near to hollywood  boulevard but without a car you can forget los angeles. to long distances to much time in bus. john is the very best of the staff memebers he really helps you, some of the ladies had no plan about public transportation and were to lazy to check in the computer. kitchen and room are very clean they take really care about this, but met no good people and l.a. is so boring, sorry."

Ireland,Female,31-40,8.3,0,10,8,0,10,8,6,wifi was really not good and consistently slow or not able to load pages. in the end  had to buy a pass to use the hostels pcs (pricey). hostel is located well to see hollywood and staff very helpful. the hostel organises lots of tours and events worth taking part in. hollywood not the nicest part of la so recommend a short stay if going. my room was small and nptot that much space for 6 people.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel with an awesome atmosphere

Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,nice and clean with a great area out the front to have a few drinks and meet other travellers.  right on hollywood blvd so this is very handy if you want to be in the heart of hollywood.  hostel on the whole was clean and nice to be in.
USA,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,"i really enjoyed my stay here. i shared a room with 5 other people who were very friendly. the bathroom was very clean and everyone who stayed at the hostel did a good job keeping the community kitchen clean. as for location, the hostel is located right in hollywood, so everything is walking distance. unfortunately, the beach shuttle was down, so going to venice beach took 1.5 hours (2 buses). the staff was very pleasant, and i particulary liked johnny who was very welcoming and professional."
Ireland,MixedGroup,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels that i have stayed in. clean, safe and nice beds. epic limo tours and pub crawls! thanks snoopy!! will def be back at some stage!"
England,Male,25-30,8.3,0,10,8,0,8,8,8,pretty good overall. although they ought to have put up signs saying that the vending machine wouldn't accept coins. it wasn't fixed in 4 nights. can be very noisy and has quite a high turnover of guests even during the small hours.
France,Male,31-40,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"one of the best place i've been so far. you may think it's a bit expensive, but no regret if you can afford it. everyone was relax, so it was a nice time. nice professionnal and helpful staff. many things provided, or for a cheap price. nice location, kitchen, breakfast. i really loved the beds, strong, with a plate on the side protecting you from the light. convenient lokers with plugs inside. i also appreciated the bbq. very good vibs there ..."

England,Female,31-40,9,0,10,8,0,10,10,8,staff were great - so friendly and helpful. loved the fact that you had to show your key before entering - i know this can be a pain when your there but it makes the hostel feel safe. loved the activities that the hostel provided and i urge anyone staying there to book on them because you meet loads of people that way.

Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,if you are in la to see hollywood this is the place to be. located in a quiet side street it takes all of 30 seconds to walk to hollywood boulevard. the staff are very friendly and the hostel is very relaxed. there is a bar upstairs but for me travelling alone it lacked any character and the chance to meet people. however i was there only for one night during the week and i did meet a few people. you can bring your own drinks into the hostel but they must be drank out the front in the garden. nice touch i t
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,8,0,8,10,10,"amazing hostel! awesome vibe, great staff. very safe, i felt i could leave my belongings in my room without a care. bathrooms were cleaned everyday. the location is excellent to, right off hollywood blvd and close to a lot of eateries. would definitely recommend to any of my friends and will return on my next visit."
China,Female,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"it's really wonderful for me to choose this hostel and stay there for 5 days. best location, best service and best the best in everything. i recommend you this very strongly."
USA,Couple,41+,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,very good hostel for the $.  free ride to beach which is 20 miles away. need more bathrooms. good kitchen but need more work space.
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great staff, excellent security, great meals at the hostel, good location. i did the runyon canyon hike and the hollywood sign hike, both worth while doing for great sights of the city! personal lights and power points. big lockers which had power points in them too. would defintely stay here again and recommend to a friend."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,6,0,10,10,10,"everything about this place was top notch, just not really my kind of location. friendly and helpful staff, excellent standards of cleanliness, nice atmosphere. if they opened a branch in west hollywood as well, then they'd be set! but for anybody after the whole hollywood tourist experience, this is the place for you. go no further!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"if you want to stay in the heart of hollywood stay here! right next to hollywood blvd and there is always stuff happening like organised tours, pub crawls and not to mention cheap beers in the bar!  thanks for a great stay"

Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,the location of the hostel is perfect. the staff are very polite and attentive. cleaning is something incredible. and the rooms are extremely beautiful and well groomed.
Germany,Male,18-24,8,0,6,10,0,8,6,10,1. way too less bathrooms for so many people!  2. to show the key everytime you enter the hostel was annoying.

USA,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"the security was great because you had to present a room key to the front desk to get into the main hallway of the hostel. the staff were all really awesome people and it made for a really cool environment. they have a bar upstairs that they keep open as long as there are partygoers, and with all partying that goes on at this hostel, they still manage to keep everything extremely clean. if you're young and single and planning on traveling to l.a., this is the perfect hostel for you."
England,Female,25-30,9,0,10,8,0,10,10,8,"the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the hostel is just around the corner from hollywood boulevard. although the immediate area does not look very inviting, i felt very secure at the hostel as you have to show your keycard to get past the locked door in reception. there are large lockers in the rooms which were big enough to get my backpack in and there are plug sockets in the lockers so you can leave items to charge. there are plenty of activities on offer day and night."
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,i enjoyed a lot my staying in usa hollywood hostel. it was very well located and organized. that's a very good option! and the breakfast was delicious! choose it!
USA,Male,18-24,9.3,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,what an absolute fun place.  would recommend it to anyone.  lots to do and staff are wonderful
Netherlands,Male,41+,7.7,0,6,10,0,8,8,6,"a lot to say for this hostel. efficient pleasant helpful staff, great location, everything works. will probably return if in hollywood. but the sign saying between 11pm and 8 am is quiet time is an absolute joke. everybody, even the staff is loud during the night. in corridors with hard surface that means loud. the music however is switched of."
Norway,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"awesome and well run hostel.   very clean, with housekeeping cleaning rooms every day  loads of activities to join in on.  location is great, with hollywood blwd just up the block.   and, the best thing of all, the staff. they will bend over backwards to make your stay as good as possible."

Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"best hostel in los angeles for sure, and one of the best hostels i stayed in!"
USA,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,10,8,great location. events every night - i didnt end up attending any due to other plans but they seemed fun and would have been great if i had been traveling alone. the map they give you on arrival isn't great and the directions on it to major attractions aren't great either (we ended up transferring onto the wrong bus because the direction werent specific enough). i would definitely get your own map and have a look at google transit before going anywhere.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the hostel is located in an excellent area for tourist attractions. it also has a great atmosphere and the hostel runs activities every day to keep travellers occupied and to enable you to meet new people. worth it.
France,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"good location (5-10 minutes walking from the kodak theater and well deserved by metro and bus, which is great for those who don't drive). rooms are clean for an hostel and everything is functionnal (lockers in the room, plugs everywhere, magnetic card to lock/unlock the room). the kitchen is also clean &amp; functionnal, you will have pancake breakfest in the morning. the staff is nice and helpful, and they organize events (bbq, shows) and excursions for cheap (hiking in hollywood hills, shuttle)."

Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,0,10,8,0,8,8,8,"friendly staff, easy walk to 2 metro stations and many bus stops.   ensuite bathrooms handy though a pain when 5 girls all wanna get ready to leave at once."

Australia,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,a great place to stay. you meet a ton of other people who are all friendly.    the staff are friendly and they take security seriously.    they also offer lots of tours that you can sign up for and meet other people. perfect for the solo traveller.    it is quite pricey though.
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"very fun hostel. so much going on, it's impossible to run out of things to do and also impossible to not meet people. definitely recommended."
Switzerland,MixedGroup,18-24,7.3,0,10,8,0,6,6,8,"unfortunately, we had a room at the very back of the hostel which was located directly next to a post-delivery centre. it was very noisy from about 4am on..."

England,Female,25-30,9,0,10,8,0,8,10,8,"this is definately a party hostel suited to the younger crowd travelling. they offer round the clock activities so you're guareteed to meet people and have something to do. there is a real feeling that you are being looked after, there's free breakfast of pancakes and spagetti and bbq's most nights. i went on the limo ride and that was so much fun! drinks are half the price of surrounding bars in the lounge, the outside areas nice also. 2 hours bus journey from the beach is the only drawback."
Australia,Female,41+,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"some staff excellent:  young blond german girl (or similar nationality). she was friendly, helpful, enthusiastic &amp; positive.  young little male (i think he was male but hard to tell, especially in his high heels) - he was enthusiastic, welcoming &amp; friendly  however bit of an unfriendly gestarpo bully attitude fr lesbian - ok there's jobs to do in running an establishment &amp; maintaining hard earned cudos &amp; standards but they could be equally or better achieved in an attitude of cheer and positivity"
Sweden,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,a really good hostel. great staff and a lot of things going on and my bed was really comfortable.
Denmark,Male,18-24,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,6,8,"good hostel, very well located for hollywood experiences. events every night, and good opportunity to buy a cheap dinner on the hostel. free wifi, though it's fairly slow. i'd stay here again."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"this hostel is in a great location just off hollywood boulevard, very safe and clean. they have house keeping that cleans the rooms daily which is nice for a hostel. all the staff are super friendly and helpful with lots of activities daily. if your wanting to go to six flags amusement park there is a shuttle that runs on wednesday that is definitely the easiest and cheapest way to get there. the pub crawl was pretty average but all in all a great hostel, one of the best i've stayed at!"
England,Female,18-24,9,0,10,8,0,8,10,8,"location was very close to holywood bvd, with helpful staff, decent breakfast (could have done with milk available on a morning for everyone) and well kept dorms."

Scotland,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,great location and entertainment. pitty about the post service making a noise every morning and having to change rooms half way through my stay even though i booked one room well in advance.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,6,"this place has a great vibe but it is pretty much a party hostel, so if you're up for a party this is where you should stay. rooms are pretty big and it's really handy having the bathroom in the room. there is a nightclub next door so it's pretty noisy on weekends if your in but besides that the hostel is a great place to meet people and have fun. locations really good because it's close but not super close to the main part of hollywood blvd so there are lots of cool bars and cafe's around."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,enjoyed the fact that the hostel organised activties as i was travelling by myself.
Australia,Female,31-40,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,6,"cheap beer! met some nice people in the hostel, but generally a younger (early 20s) crowd. they loaned me a towel for free because i had missing luggage, which was nice, but they wouldn't let me look through the lost &amp; found box which i thought odd. the guy on night shift was particularly helpful. is right next to a carpark frequented by the local undesirables who like to party with their cheap liquor in brown paper bags. the type of place that organises wet t-shirt comps on independence day."
Australia,Couple,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,8,10,10,"great location with standard dorm rooms.  a bit expensive, but that's just la.  we would stay here again."
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,8,0,6,10,0,8,8,8,"the hostel was good,i liked the area, the staff was nice. the price is absolutly fair for what you get there.  i have one bad comment - because one of my room mates (in a mixed dorm) went partying and brought a girl into his bed in our room. i felt very angry and uncomfortable about this. a mixed dorm is not the right place for this lifestyle."
Australia,Male,31-40,9,0,10,10,0,8,10,8,"great location, great staff, great activities, a real party atmosphere. i met alot of great people, and there was always something to do. i will always be staying at usa hostels when im in america."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the people are nice it's a little noisy at night and they're are clubs down the street but if your tired from a busy day it shouldn't bother you.
England,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i was very sad to only have 1 night here. the hostel organises a number of group activities that you can sign up for near reception. the beds are great! each one is massive, comfortable and best of all has it's own little alcove area complete with charger, shelf and lamp - a blessing compared to your standard hostel! there were 2 extra chargers inside each locker. it was also in an excellent location from the hollywood strip, just a few minutes walk. i'd definitely stay there again!"
Canada,Male,25-30,8,0,10,8,0,8,4,8,"the hostel has a lot of character. the outdoor terrace is a good place to meet fellow travellers. however, it was, during my stay, a party hostel.  girl in my dorm vomitted all over her stuff (missing mine by inches) and the staff thought it was almost funny. if you're looking for a good party, it's a good place to be. if you're looking for quiet, not so much. other than that, security, staff and location are all great."
Australia,Female,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,great location in hollywood! hostel staff were very friendly and there are always lots of day trips and activities being organised. wish i had have been there longer to take advantage of them all. would definitely stay here again.

Malaysia,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,8,0,6,8,8,the hotel can get quite noisy at night because of the pub crawl etc. and not everyone stays up late in the hostel. would be better if they put ppl like us at the back of the hostel instead of right at the front rooms where everyone passes by.     overall it was a great place with lotsa bubbly cheerful friendly people.
England,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"the best hostel i've stayed at in 5 months of travelling. the staff were always friendly, and ready to help out and give advice, the tours from the hostel were so cheap and so much fun especially considering the price you would pay elsewhere. the entertainment at night was amazing and a lot of fun."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"the hostel is a pretty good hostel. they have a good kitchen, decent breakfast and good lounge/ bar area. the sometimes didn't seem to know the answers to our questions about the area but they were friendly enough so was not really an issue. i would come back"

Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,0,10,10,0,4,8,10,"i had a great experience with this hostel except one thing. i was sick one evening and rushed out of my room at approx 3am to use the bathroom. i grabbed my wallet, but unfortunately my key wasnt in there. the person on night duty saw me wandering around in my pjs and i told him i was sick, however when i discovered i didnt have a key, and asked him if he could let me into my room he refused, and told me i'd have to knock and wake someone up. not good at 3am. so i had to wait outside until 7am."

Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,10,"the hostel's rooms are a little too small, and there is only one bathroom per room, which can get crowded sometimes. other than that, no big complaints. it is a pretty clean place (there's someone cleaning up the rooms on a daily basis), and is pretty well located too (although la itself seems to be a pretty rough ciry). i would recommend it to friends."
British,MixedGroup,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"possibly the most fun  hostel possible.   really cool outside area, cheap dinners.   mac computers with skype.  rooms with bathrooms.   just stay at this hostel. not one complaint."

Italy,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,"definitely a very good hostel, new and clean and very lively (even too much if you are just looking for some rest..). i very appreciated how they cared about all those small details that make a difference, in the common areas as well as in the bunk beds structure"
Sweden,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"this hostel is great. i kept extending my stay!  they have plenty of tours and activities, free pancakes (you'll make them yourself, you lazy...) and good security.  only negative i can come up with is the noise from the club next to the hostel. but that is really not an issue. hostel living, you know..  remember to bring your own padlock, or but it in the reception for 3 bucks."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,a fantastic service mentality along with a 'value for money' ethos is fundamental to the success of this hostel. i highly recommend it.
England,Male,18-24,6,0,8,8,0,2,6,6,staff are abit rubbish but you are 5 minutes from everything you need and they have trips which you can do which were ok. i would stay again but think staff need to be abit more professional
Australia,Male,41+,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,very good. nothing bad to say. i would go back.
Jordan,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great location, limo ride was awesome.. the staff is very helpful , karim and haley in particular made the stay a lot easier. thank you guys for everything.. will definitely stay there again."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,8,0,8,10,10,"first things first this is possibly one of the best hostels i've stayed in! there was free wifi that allowed me to call home on skype, free pancakes all day, and free (some paid for) activities every day. great for independent travellers, i met heaps of friends! locations ok, a fair way from beverly hills but easy enough to get there by bus. when you go out just be street smart! this is deff some where i'd stay again!"
Netherlands,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,best hostel if you want to see hollywood!
England,Male,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"stay here! situated in the heart of hollywood; only a short walk from the metro station, 2 blocks from the greyhound station and around the corner from hollywood blvd! on arrival you're made to feel welcomed and if your room's available early, they'll check you. this was my 3rd time here and they have upgraded all the facilities; the rooms and bathrooms are very clean, bunks have reading lamps + power points + a little shelf and large in room lockers. the staff are uber friendly and informative."
England,Female,18-24,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,i didnt stay here cos its really expensive.  banana bungalow west hollywood is the best hostel in hollywood
France,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,stayed there 5 times in 4 years but still awesome place with lots of fun.
Canada,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"extremely clean, friendly staff, fun events such as walking tour and limo ride, great deals on food such as spaghetti dinner and bbq, ideal location."
USA,Female,25-30,7,0,10,6,0,8,8,8,"i booked for 3 nights but stayed for 1 because i checked out too late i couldn't be refunded the 2nd day amount (hostel rule), but i should have been allotted the 3rd day since i gave them plenty of time for the third day.  the girl at the desk left a note for the manager but i never heard from them.  i called and sent an e-mail but they never responded.  unprofessional and greedy since they were booked full the night before. will not book again"
Scotland,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this was a great hostel, and a pleasure to stay at.  on arrival, a member of staff gave a personal tour of the hostel showing where everything is, and mentioning hostel activities (pub-crawl the night i was there), very personable.  very impressed with extent of security, to the point of having electricity sockets within your locker - innovative.  downtown la is the dive that everyone knows it to be, but spots like hollywood really are the place to be, and this hostel is right there, literally."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,8,"great large hostel close to hollywood with loads of activities, internet and free breakfast with pancakes or muesli. the daily cheap tours on offer are a nice option to do if you don't feel up to doing stuff on your own and a great way to meet people. nice bar and large kitchen with a lot of utensils if you feel up to cooking. 8 bed dorms are spacious enough and cleaned daily.  had a great time here and was sad to leave as it was my last travel city."
Sweden,Male,31-40,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"not to much to complain about. having the bar open every night may sound cool but young people who drink get very very loud. the location is great, close to walk of fame and an easy trainride to the studios. if you are a young person ther is nothing wrong with this place."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,rad hostel one of the best ive stayed in everything was great from the rooms and staff to location and things going on x
Australia,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,loved this hostel and snoopy (one of the staff members) knew how to take the hostel out for a great night on the town!!
Australia,Male,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,8,10,8,i had a great 3 nights in this hostel. the staff are all pretty friendly and the location is great for seeing the attractions in hollywood. the organized activities such as the walking tours and the limo ride were awesome!!! i would highly recommend staying here if you want to have a good time in hollywood!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"extremely clean, loads of great activities/tours/etc held. best thing was that the lockers in the dorms had 2 power switches inside them, so you could lock away valuables and charge them without worrying they'll be stolen. each room had private shower/bathroom so didn't have to worry about communal showering =s"
Germany,Female,25-30,6.3,0,10,8,0,4,6,6,the female-dorm beds are really nice made up...everyone had still her privacy and own light. pancakes are yummi. during the christmasdays the organization of the tours was so bad and unreliable! cancellations just a few minutes before...so that you had to change your plans...although you had just a couple of days. stuff was not friendly. location very good.
China,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i stayed at a 6bed female dorm. clean room, nice roommate. great lounge and convenient facilities. good option for single travellers to meet people and tour around. i don't often stay in hostels. but comparing to no brand hotel or motels in la, this hostel is much much better choice. i will stay again if i go to la next time"
USA,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"this is a great place to stay in la.  located right on hollywood blvd., it's a great departure point to see the rest of the city (which, to no fault of the hostel, is tedious without a car).  there are daily programs to bring the hostel guests together, and staff is very accommodating.  i'm impressed with the security here, especially considering how many weirdos are in hollywood.  i would gladly stay here again."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.7,0,6,8,0,8,6,6,couldn't sleep as people were partying outside my room most nights. one night a girl in my room had her drink spiked on the limo ride so we had so many people in our room who were very inconsiderate of those trying to sleep &amp; one guy kept coming in &amp; out &amp; slaming the door. did washing one night after 9 only to find out that you can't wash after 9 as it's noisy &amp; will disturb people trying to sleep. had to leave my washing wet &amp; smelly till the next morn as door was locked. should be open 24/7!
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,this is definately a great party hostel. met lots of great people here on my stay. really close to the walk of fame and hollywood sign. ended up staying longer than intended cause i was having too much fun!!!

Argentina,Male,25-30,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,6,"pros: free breakfast, free coffee and tea all day, nice activities.  cons: at least the guys in my room had no respect for the ones sleeping in the bedroom, so they talked each other at high voice level and turned on lights. not very clean."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"while i was there the washine machine; computer and printer was not working. also, it was quite loud at night. great location though."

Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"great hostel. nice staff and were very helpful. it is a party hostel so expect to socialise and not go to bed too early. but when you did get to bed it was an awesome little set up in the rooms with bedheads with reading lamps, electrical outlets and a shelf. very comfortable."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"had a lovely stay - missed our bus to san fran and they were so helpfull with our next step. we stayed in a mixed dorm 8 bed and had an amazing time. so much to do, the hostel organise's nights out. the location is perfect, and the staff are fab. free pancakes in the mornings are yummy too. over all an amazing stay and i would 100% stay here again. thanks usa hostels!! x"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"sweet as hostel, the only downer was that i was in a room right next to the laundry, so wasn't always guarenteed hot water when showering. really nice hostel in a good location. being vegan i thought it was going to be hard to eat, but the girl kat on reception helped me out alot and i think i gained a bit of weight haha. easy to meet people with heaps of cool hang out areas within the hostel, definately recommend!!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"great hostel in an awesome location just off hollywood blvd. great facilities, including the lounge and bar."
England,Couple,31-40,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,it was a gr8 location....  but the shower was perminantly running so the staff gave me ear plugs but they were free!!!  would stay again.
England,Male,31-40,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,great hostel ideally situated between holly blvd and sunset blvd - lots of activities and ultra friendly staff. highly recommeded
Portugal,Female,31-40,7.3,0,8,10,0,4,8,8,"don't do the runyon canyon trip with the hostel guide. ask for a map instead. also, ignore the snobbish answers of some of the staff, i think it's mandatory in la. overall good hostel, but a bit loud, making it hard do have a good night sleep. very good location."
England,Male,25-30,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"excellent hostel, one of the best ive stayed in! great activities organised by the hostel, great location, helpful staff, would reccomend to anyone!"

Brazil,Male,31-40,8.7,0,10,10,0,6,10,8,"i strongly recommend for those whom wants to stay at usa hostel hollywood during your time in la. the hostel held a lot of attractions to interactive with other guests and start to the fun time. very well located, few steps from walk of fame and less than 5 min from metro station. just one staff members does not have good threatment with guests, but i consider this issue as isolated point."
England,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,8,10,10,"almost there but not quite usa las vegas shows your hostel up on the friendliness of the staff making a real effort to interact, but a cool hostel with a good atmosphere would stay again"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"fun hostel! location is excellent (just off hollywood blvd) and the staff are friendly and helpful. the bar upstairs is awesome - they have comedy and open mic nights, and the drinks are super cheap (pre drink there before you go out!!!). be sure to do the limo tour - great value for money and you're guaranteed an excellent night."
Italy,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the best hostel i've ever seen
Australia,Female,18-24,6.7,0,2,8,0,8,8,8,"the location was excellent, a five minute walk from the heart of hollywood. most of the staff were lovely and helpful. the rooms were kept very clean.  the hostel itself could use some character, more activities, a lick of paint and some more traveller-friendly details (such as a better map or a book swap shelf).  i was actually robbed at this hostel and was very unhappy with the response i have received. security appears to be strong when in actual fact it is very weak inside the front door."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this is by far the best hostel i have ever stayed in all the social activitys organised each day and night are awesome beach trips, stars homes tours, hollywood sign,etc and pub crawls and limo rides at night. this is a party hostel but the noise is kept under control so if you want to rest you can.  only 100m from hollywood blvd"

Australia,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,6,10,a well run operation. good service and facilities. but disappointing that the tours always fill up very quickly.
Scotland,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,8,8,10,"really nice place and very secure. you can only enter the building by showing your key card. staff do well when you need anything. lots of activities are organised, really nice lounge but didn't find it the most sociable hostel and people stuck to their groups alot. that being said i still met many people there"
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"it's located few steps away from the main touristic places in hollywood. the room and bathrooms are very clean, and the staff is helpful and friendly. i would recomended it for my friends!"

England,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,located just off hollywood blvd - if you're lucky you will see some movie stars just around the corner at the chinese theatre for the movie premieres.    large hostel has its own bar which is great social venue :)

Australia,Male,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"great sized rooms, great location (just watch out at night), great common room, great staff and will most definitely be staying here again!"
England,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,my dorm didnt lock when i arrived but it was fixed a number of hours later. the breakfast is good but it would be nice to have a wider choice or alternatives on some days. the activities offered were good and great value for money. there is a real sense of community in the hostel. the bar upstairs is really cool.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the staff were amazing i sprained my ankle on the second night and they helped me to my room got ice and everything and then all of them proceeded to look after me for the next 4 days while i was on crutches. thankyou so much to all you made everything much easier and were overly helpful!!
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,i stayed here for two nights.  it is in an excellent location and the staff are super helpful!  clean and secure i would definately stay there again!
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,the hostel had good activities every day and night. we especially liked the free comedy show. if you hire a car be careful where you park on the street after 8pm. we were told its ok to park on the street after 8pm by guests and staff but didnt check and got towed. we pulled up after dark and the part of the sign detailing the towing was obscured by trees. it cost us 250 bucks to get the car back plus a 60 dollar fine. ouch.
Australia,Male,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"good hostel. good location just off hollywood blvd. near all the action and transport links. staff are good, show you around and help out. very much a party hostel. dorms should be for sleeping though, not having parties. that's what the common areas/bars are for."
Japan,Female,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,wonderful!!!
Australia,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"very well run hostel. shame it's full of aussies, but hey, what hostel isn't?"
Mexico,Male,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"excelente localizacion,,"
Germany,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,nice discount on universal studios tickets. and yummy peancake breakfast.
Spain,Male,25-30,7.7,0,6,10,0,8,6,8,"very close to kodak theatre, 10 min walking. very nice staff, a lovely terrace just to have a beer if you don't wanna go out. some clubs around in hollywood boulevard. computers are really slow and are not for free. breakfast was not as complete as usual."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,6,"hostel is, plenty to offer like cheap bbq, some tours, pub crawls(not recommended - 2 pubs is not a crawl) location is short walk to hollywood blvd."
Sweden,Male,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"had a great time, it's everything they claim to be and it's easy to see how they got to be rated as highly as they are. all positives from me!"
Ireland,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"i really liked my stay in usa hostels.its very central for hollywood boulavard however for the beaches its about an hours bus journey away ( they do run a free shuttle twice a wk ).very clean hostel with its on little bar area, wii, and dvd's etc. they always have something organised for ppl to do.i would recommend staying here."
USA,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"free pancakes and wifi were nice, and being able to bring in your own alcohol or buy it there was handy. only real complaints would be the 10:00 checkout and the price, but that's relative since it is hollywood. parking sucks too ($10 for 24 hours, and it's a few blocks away), but that doesn't affect my review since it's not something the hostel has control over, and many people are probably taking buses anyway, so.... stay here!"
Germany,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,6,8,10,"really great hostel! very close to hollywood and also the supermarket is in walking distance. cleaned every day and lots of free offers or cheap tours. would really recommend it! staff is also very nice, depends who you talk to :-)"
England,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,6,0,8,8,8,good clean hostel with big rooms and comfy beds. kitchen area and bar were really good and patio area outside. ensuite bathrooms were kept really clean and so was the kitchen. had good activities planned and was easy to meet new people. good international crowd.
England,Male,25-30,8,0,10,8,0,8,6,10,"perhaps a hostel with such great reviews leads to expecting too much but i found this place to be a little dull. the hostel is quite large and very noisy... and that's by hostel standards. the security is rigid which is a plus, but a little annoying at times. very clean, and the friendly staff make up for the somewhat vacant feel at times. facilities are good and there is always something going on."
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"the best hostel i have ever stayed at. pretty much on hollywood blvd, close to all the buses to get to the beaches, and really close to all the hollywood sights. the limo tour is amazing (if you don't do it you are really missing out), as is the pub crawl. the staff are awesome, and will party with you! gooood pancakes... all night haha. great for single travellors and groups of people. good place to chill with a tv and bar, great to meet people. definitely a party hostel."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"nice hostel in a primespot in hollywood. also be sure to take some trips organized by the hostel, and go on the clubtours at night, loads of fun. you will meet plenty of people here at night in the tv room or at comedy nights or during the day hanging around the patio. very nice place to stay and clean!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,10,6,"social atmosphere - great. did the hummer limo tour &amp; met some great people, had a ball. rooms a little cramped, but all lockers + powerpoints was good. couldnt really be bothered with the free pancakes for breakfast. bbq dinner was good."
USA,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,6,quieter than i'd expect for hollywood... excellent security. saw a roach but otherwise clean.
CzechRepublic,Female,31-40,8.3,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"very smart hostel. i was unliky on roommates, otherwise i can highly recommend it!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,10,8,0,8,8,8,whoever thought of putting powerpoints inside lockable lockers is a genius! big hostel with tours going on which are great for people who arrive with no plans.
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"great hostel to stay, if you like party and meet other travellers this is the place!!!"
Canada,Male,25-30,9,0,6,10,0,10,10,8,hostel is located near the blvd which is a bonus if you want to do all the hollywood tours and all that. even just going walking around is good. very clean place and the staff was friendly.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,6,i didn't stay here too long but i would highly recommend the location. minutes from all the sights. friends have stayed here and got to enjoy the nightlife more! it was  very noisy one but really and truly i think that's always going to happen in hollywood. toughen up.
Canada,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"awesome hostel. i hated the city, but this hostel made our stay in la quite enjoyable. wonderful staff, awesome bar/recreation mood. definite party spot though, so if you want more peace and quite you might want to abstain. limo night was a lot of fun!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,0,10,8,0,8,8,8,hostel was close to the main area of hollywood but up the dodgy end of the main drag. had to walk quickly at night. the rooms were standard nothing to complain about and the kitchen had everything you needed. staff were nice and organised airport pick up.
Lithuania,Female,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice place, good atmosphere, good location.it is always clean, the staff is very nice, helpful. the only thing that surprises me are the prices that often go higher than in new york or paris in this kind of hostels."
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,this place was great and i was sad to leave. everyone is open and friendly and i met a lot of cool people. only issue i had the whole time was the heating/air was going a little crazy but other than that this place is 10/10
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"room was clean.  clean sheet, pillow case, blanket &amp; towel provided at “check-in”.  tv in room, but not connected to cable or antenna.  no hangers in the closet.  free breakfast (toast or cereal) including coffee or juice, provided each day at 8 am (didn’t open sunday).  don’t sign up for the hollywood tour, it can be cancelled at any moment, without notice."
Canada,Male,18-24,6.3,10,4,4,8,8,2,8,"i would not recommend this hostel. it is cheap, but the atmosphere is dead.    pros:  -cheap  -nice sitdown/patio areas    cons  -lacks a good common room to meet others  -location is near hollywood, but the specific street it is on is sketchy  -dead atmosphere (i went during the winter low season, which may have played a part)  -not many hostel activities"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed staying here. i added on one extra night, then staff and the owners are so helpful. i highly recommend the hollywood tour. it was great fun to walk around. the whole place has a good vibe and i felt safe as a solo female traveller."
USA,Female,41+,6,8,8,8,4,6,4,4,"they don't have enough toilets, showers, refrigerators, etc for how many people they have.  3 inch foam mattresses are unacceptable!  quiet hours not enforced.  dirty."
Brazil,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"i had a great time at the time zone hollywood hostel. the atmosphere is awesome and location is unbeatable. the employees are very friendly and helpful with highlight to carlos bustillo and cristiano jeep. carlos is always ready to help you with whatever you may need, he also knows the best things to do and to visit at hollywood. cristiano's good mood every morning during breakfast always cheer you up even if you are down. i definitely recommend it."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,"this hostel was good for what you pay, although could do with some improvements. on the website it says they have an airport shuttle (not true) and check in begins at 3pm not 2pm. they weren't responsive to emails but staff were lovely once we arrived. the hostel is very clean and i liked the free toiletries available in the bathroom. it is about a 20 minute walk from hollywood boulevard.     we were awoken to someone entering our room, not sure how they got in so that was a bit of a worry. "
Chile,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"great staff , reasonable prices, wonderful location , i would definetely  recommend this place to stay "
USA,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,hostel does not have 24 hour reception as advertised. i was not able to checkin when i arrived nor reach them regarding my booking  via phone or email. after contacting hostelworld.com they also were not able to put me in contact with them and i had to forfeit my deposit and seek other arrangements for my stay in la. i highly recommend calling the hostel prior to booking.
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,10,8,4,8,8,6,8,"the timezone was the cheapest hostel at the time that i booked, but the price doesn't reflect on the quality of this hostel. amenities included an outdoor kitchen, a large outdoor social area, a small movie area with netflix and even massage chairs!   the atmosphere here comes and goes but it's still a decent place to lay your head."
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,"was not the cleanest, but was cheapest one around. about a 15 minute walk from hollywood blvd. "
India,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best inexpensive accommodation options at walking distance form hollywood highland/vine metro stations in la. hostel interiors are based on hollywood theme. i stayed in room ""the legends"". very clean, comfortable and well maintained. good free-breakfast facilities and awesome kitchen. fantastic backyard common sitting area with psychedelic lighting in the furniture and decent music system. paid laundry service. before going out, just get best directions from staff!"
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,this is an odd building. it was clearly an office building turned into a hostel. it's very loud with plastic walls to the rooms that pop when the ac is on and a creaky staircase that sounds like it's hundreds of years old. the internet connection was dial up speed - probably because the telecom stuff is literally within a women's shower. 20 minute walk to the subway. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"clean facilities, friendly staff, and walking distance from hollywood blvd! i loved how there were free towels &amp; toiletries available, and the rooms were clean and well kept. the building is a bit echo-y, so it can get loud. i imagine that a stay over a friday or saturday night could get noisy, but my stay on a sunday night was great!"
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it’s perfect! 
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.3,8,4,10,8,10,10,8,"awesome hostel, planned on staying 1 night but ended up staying for 3 more! location is good, staff is amazing but no lockers and security is kind of sketchy. would stay again"
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,8,8,"great experience overall. good location that's walkable with easy access to mass transit. room was small but clean and adequately appointed (would appreciate a small desk). tv remote would not work, floor lamp would not turn on but whatever. breakfast was dissapointing, even by hostel standards. half a cup of decent coffee, white bread to toast, cream cheese, two cereals and milk (on the edge of spoiled one day). no fruit or protein like eggs or peanut butter. despite criticism, a great deal."
Austria,Male,25-30,3.4,2,6,4,4,4,2,2,"horrible. most rooms don't have any windows to the outside. walls are paper thin (have to bring earplugs). smoking area outside of lower corridor - constant draft from outside blows smoke into some rooms, whereas others stink unbearably. light can penetrate all room doors, as they have blurred windows in them - light-sensitive people have to bring a sleeping mask. you won't get any discounts or refunds - just transfers into other rooms with more or less the same characteristics."
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,2,10,6,2,2,6,6,no one opened the door when i rang bell. i would not go around back. 
India,Male,25-30,7.4,4,6,10,2,10,10,10,"great location and staff. the night i stayed, the hostel was overboked, and by the time i came to check-in, i did not have a room that i already reserved. they gave me a refund and a smaller area to sleep in for that one night after requesting that. the person on the front desk had to make few calls, but at the end it all went well. i would prefer if the hostels do not overbook, and provide the guests with what they reserved."
Australia,Female,25-30,5.1,2,4,4,4,8,6,8,don't even bother. 
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"all the staff here are friendly and happy to help. the hostel is very clean. there's plenty of showers. not only do you get a towel,shower gel, shampoo and conditioner but there's also razors, body lotions and other handy things available.  it's in a great location, walk of fame is about a 15 minute walk. we also walked to the hollywood sign in less than an hour and a half. universal is less than 10 mins and cost around $10 in an uber. one of the best hostels i have stayed in. "
Norway,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,excellent place. location okay. please see my short film  hollywood christmas parade 2017. short film by olddudesaja  https://youtu.be/0otlpclsnwq
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"it was pretty good, just a few small things that i wished were different.  there wasn't actually  a useable mirror in my room...there was a very small one, maybe 4 square inches that was too high up on the wall for me to use. in the restrooms there were no outlets near any mirrors so doing your hair in a mirror isn't really an option. there's also no place to get clean water to drink unless you use the vending machine. i wish there was a drinking fountain or something."
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location for me was the best. just off of sunset and close to hollywood boulevard and highland. you can even walk to melrose avenue for shopping and food. and griffith park isn't too far either, therefore it's very possible to walk up to franklin ave near los feliz to get into the park and hike! the hollywood sign hike is nearby, too! this hostel in the arts and media mecca of la, and you will meet very many talented and amazing people here. the staff at tz were all very helpful, too."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nicole and andrea were the best. nicole cooking was outstanding, she is a chef in disguise.  i looked forward to coming the hostel after work to eat dinner. i really felt as though i was at home, dinner was ready and being served.       now, andrea was as pleasant anyone should be. she is a great desk clerk. she is  always smiling and greeting everyone, making everyone feel special.       i can't wait to go back and stay there again. i also recommend the time zone hostel to my other traveling nurses"
England,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,8,10,6,8,we only stayed overnight so didn't get to use all the facilities. the staff were very friendly and helpful. the room was acceptably clean and the location suited us for that night. 
NorthernIreland,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i only stayed for 1 night on private room, i liked the staff very friendly but im not sure about the room location as it was ground floor on main corridor so wasn't quiet, i could also hear the person in the dorm next to me due to how the ventilation system is in place. earplugs helped. bed was comfy and did the job. my only complaint was lack of decent continental breakfast which when i got it didn't consist of much other than a bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. "
HongKong,Male,25-30,6,6,6,4,4,6,8,8,"location is far away from the city centre, and there's nothing nearby, quite inconvenience to you to experience la. rooms are big and clean compared to the other messy la hostel that i've stayed before, but it was still a bit crowded with a poor sound-proofed wall, a bit noisy at night. one thing i love for sure is the outdoor common area, quite a stylish one."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,6,6,8,10,8,overall it was fun staying at timezone.  staff if friendly and you feel secure.    i was lucky enough to be able to stay in a private room and was glad roku was available.    only complaint is that it is a bit of a distance to anywhere..
Netherlands,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, only 15 minutes from the walk of fame, the metro to downtown and about 5 minutes from the busstop to santa monica. staff is very helpful and nice, breakfast was pretty good as long as youre early. beds are capsules and comfortable, though the mattrass is thin. very clean, good social areas. could use something in the bathroom to hang up your stuff. the hostel is good value for your money and a safe and good choice for los angeles."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,loved the message chair and staff where supper helpfull especially hanns
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing place, couldn't reccomend more due to the every intricate details being catered for. from the massage chairs to the food nights. but please do fix our wifi guys, for someone who had interviews and plenty of emails, this was a real downfall.     besides that everything is perfect... "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"super people, awesome location, extra clean"
Philippines,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,4,10,8,6,"i think the place is good in general except their toilet. the toilet on the 2nd floor is so small and the shower lacks hooks or table where we can hang our clothes, and too narrow as well. "
SouthAfrica,Female,25-30,7.1,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,nice hostel. good facilities and staff. but the most uncomfortable mattress i have ever slept on. the mattress is a foam mattress topper not an actual mattress. 
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,i truly had a enjoyable visit. thank you!
England,Male,18-24,6.6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,"the hostel didn't look fully furnished, work was clearly still going on which was of putting. staff seemed unorganised. breakfast wasn't really all that. but for the price you get what you pay for especially in la. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,4,8,8,10,6,8,8,"nice hostel with good facilities and good location near hollywood boulevard, but the staff were horribly disorganised. had to sit around waiting in the lobby for 90 minutes to check in. new hostel, so i'm sure this will get better as they settle in."
Wales,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,very nice place to stay but the standard basic single room is not a room and basically a box with outlets with a light and fan.
Italy,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great brand new hostel in great location, just a walk from dolby theater. security camera and screening at the entrance. despite is still in start up phase the staff acted greatly to solve same problems in a very efficient manner, customer oriented.  great atmosphere in commons areas during night time (im a quite solitary guy, but there, i managed to make friendships). fully air conditioned. kitchen and toilets always shining, cleaners everywhere all day long. capsules spacious and comfy."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,7.4,6,4,8,6,10,8,10,"i liked the time zone hostel overall, the staff was great and there was a really nice atmosphere and many organized activities. however, the ""private"" room i booked turned out to be a bunk bed with a cheap, light curtain in a giant 30-bed room, which also served as a hallway for 4 other dorm rooms. the lights couldn't be turned off. the lockers were only big enough for a small daypack and the room couldn't be locked so anyone could just walk into the hostel and steal your luggage."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"can i live here?   i loved this hostel. from the moment you step inside (to a blissfully air conditioned space) you are in a well-designed, clean and safe environment.   the staff here were immediately friendly and i genuinely felt welcomed and engaged. cute bowties too. they were happy to hold my bag (in a locked room)  and when i checked in, i got a tour by one of the staff-members.     i stayed in one of the capsules and got the best sleep i've had in months. cozy af. "
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,low key not next to all the noise but still in prime area
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very clean, lovely helpful staff. good facilities.   everyone was really nice   location was really good walking distance to hollywood   great hostel for the money would defiantly go back "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,6,6,8,8,"good hostel but things to improve on for sure. probably a bit overpriced for what you get.  i had just arrived in the country after 18 hours of flying, and another flight the next day so i went to bed early to get some sleep, only to be woken up at 1am from a staff member saying i needed to change rooms to a female dorm as i'd been put in a mixed dorm and they needed the bed. not really appropriate if you ask me. and i didn't get much of an apology either."
Israel,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place- i booked my stay for 6 nights and ended up staying 11  safe- there is someone at the reception desk 24/7, and there are 2 lockers for each bed in each room which you're given a key for  clean- the whole place is cleaned everyday including the rooms and the lounges  kitchen- has everything you need  location- walking distance from hollywood boulevard and good food spots  staff- a special shoutout to nicole ismael dan and saida who showed me around and became my friends! "
Philippines,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i've ever stayed here in the usa! i'm definitely staying here again!
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,6,8,10,6,10,"clean, safe, comfy. has everything u should need. staff were all great. free washing machines/dryers is super. semi outdoor kitchen is equipt &amp; clean.  location, a bit of a hike to anywhere. i ended up enjoying the walks tho. i know la quite well &amp; felt the surrounding area was safe and friendly. closer to the main strips is naturally sketchy in hollywood. but the closer u get to the hostel the safer it is.  free brekky isn't much worth it but better than nothing.  great building security."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice place, nice staff. good location, close to everything but on a quiet street. clean, but seems to be mid-construction like it's not finished. feels like they push to be a party atmosphere with very loud staff all night long. the daytime is quieter. good bang for your buck in an expensive city. don't come here if your looking for peace and quiet, only if your down to party all night! "
India,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"very nice stay and location and staff are nice! the ac system is very weird and sometimes randomly heats/cools the room. they also plan events, though i didn’t go on any. it might also be beneficial to add more hooks/hanging rods to the shower area because there isn’t really anywhere to put your clothes. "
Antarctica,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"best hostel i went to in l.a, from walking in your treated like royalty. place is cleaned what feels like 5 times a day. the manager is for lack of a better word, obsessed with making it a better place for people. great staff, great manager, great price.  to the manager: keep it going man don't go sour and expensive like those other hostels in l.a you got something sweet here.  only down side of it being so good is next time i go to stay it'll prob be full 😂 thanks for having me."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,great value for money for such a good location and nice room. breakfast was nice and staff were all very friendly and helpful suggesting where to go nearby.
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,8,8,8,10,10,great hostel. maybe it's better to stay in santa monica.
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,first experience in a hostel. it was great! highly reccommend the hollywood bar hop tour!!

USA,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was perfect, except for the extremely noisy restaurant downstairs, which made it hard to get to sleep."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really lovely hostel. so close to absolutely everything! sarah, jordan and the other members of staff do a fantastic job. we felt very looked after throughout our whole stay. would 100% recommend to anyone thinking of travelling to la. "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel with very freidly and helpful staff,rooms were clean and comfortable. literally a minute walk to the beach and skate park. perfect location. would definitely stay again.  10/10 "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent value for money. was much cleaner and more comfortable than i expected from a hostel. perfect location. only problem is the wifi - slow and unreliable.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,this place is wacky and crazy - but in a totally good way. it's right on venice beach and you can expect the craziness that comes with that. i had an issue and staff were lovely and helped me move rooms. the manager is lovely :) 
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"perfect location, pretty much the only option around and it's a pretty good time. way more chill and fun than the one hi in santa monica. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was at the hostel next door the night before.   i am so pleased with everything about this hostel  heather at the front desk was so kind and joyful.   the room was all white and really clean.   i truly enjoyed the visit. 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the people here are great! i have stayed twice now and would stay again!!
Germany,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,i took a bed for 6 nights and i had to check out one day early. this was not a problem for them and i get also the money back. the personal is very friendly and for any questions they have an answer. due my stay there my journey took another way because of 2 beautiful girls that i've had as roommates. you can do a lot of activities there. i will definitely come back again in this hostel some day
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"what an awesome experience. samesun was great. the staff was awesome in helping other back packers connect and get out to do things. definitely in an amazing location for such an amazing price. only thing that kind of sucked was lack of wifi, but the bar downstairs was super accommodating if you needed to sit down there to get some stuff done. other than that, i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an experience in venice. will most definitely be back next year. thank you so much! "
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,4,8,10,8,8,6,8,"great location, the price on arrival was different to what was quoted by hostelworld. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,they do charge for towels $2.
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,10,4,8,8,"location great right above boardwalk, clean and good facilities - breakfast, towel, atm inside, fast wifi. the staff were very average, our window in our room was broken, staying open all night to chill the whole room, staff were reluctant to assist or organise a fix, nothing happened, people nearest window just given extra blanket."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,not such a good spot during the winter months. would be sweet in the summer though!!
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"inside the hostel very safe, the staff was very accommodating when we arrived early :)    lots of characters outside haha"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing location, awesome staff, great vibes"
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,i would  highly  recommend  it and stay there again. 
USA,Male,41+,7.7,6,10,8,6,10,6,8,"i can only speak of 7 bed dorm room 206 since other reviews have been inconsistent in their expectations. the facility overall is relatively clean, most of the guests kept to themselves.  i came here because it was close to lax which i had an early flight.  the location close to venice beach is a plus.  the room was small for 7 beds, but they were well laid out. the hall bathrooms were relatively clean.  if i need an inexpensive place to stay in la, i would definitely consider it again."
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,everything was great ....only issue i had was the odor the mattresses had. smelled of bad b/o....even with me sleeping over the comforter it seeped through.
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"right on the boardwalk, a group of sketchy people right outside the hostel though and he immediate area. the bar downstairs is alright, more of restaurant feel. good location though. not the most social hostel i’ve ever been to but not terrible. small common area felt more like a waiting room."
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,6,8,"not a bad hostel! the location, breakfast, and facilities were perfect for a hostel. however, the atmosphere wasn't that great. there wasn't a common room.  i do recommend, and i'd stay again. "
Germany,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"stayed here two times in dec 17 and jan 18, the hostel was clean and the staff was super friendly and helpful. they even provided free towels and free printouts. the bulding is pretty nice and included a nice bar downstairs where hostel guests always getschilpt choice of drinks and food for happy hour prices.  the hostel is located at the venice beach promenade, many rooms provides beach view.  the complimentary breakfast is absoluetly okay for a hostel."
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,4,10,"the location was amazing if you want to explore venice beach! the facilities were ok - very clean but the lockers were too small to fit any luggage really and they didn't give out locks. i had my own but it was too small to fit into that locker.     the staff wasn't particularly enthused or friendly, and the atmosphere in general was pretty unfriendly - no one really spoke to each other, it was very unlike most hostels i've stayed in. because of that i won't stay again. "
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,overall it was a great place to come back to and have a base for exploring. there is a lot to do in the area and being 200 ft from the boardwalk is pretty nice. the staff was super helpful when i had questions and was eager for me to explore the area. 
England,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location. 
Canada,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, beds were ok, fun bar downstairs, overall pretty happy"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,4,10,8,one of the easiest hostels i’ve been to for socliasing if you spend time in the lounge. good free pub crawls and the limo club crawl is a great value fun night where you will almost certainly meet new people. staff aren’t particularly friendly but not rude either.
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,4,8,10,8,8,10,10,"i enjoyed my stay here. the location is perfect - right on venice boardwalk and beach. there's a bar downstairs and free breakfast. the facilities were pretty basic but well kept. it is noisy outside at night, so might not be a good place for a light sleeper. i got a double room and found it pricey for what i got, but it is a popular destination, so probably to be expected"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,"hostel was clean and easy to find, the security could be a little better - was greeted with a strange man off the street running inside as soon as the door was unlocked. apart from that, really nice welcoming staff and awesome location. "
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,6,6,10,4,8,8,8,"the hostel recently added a bar/nightclub of sorts below the hostel, which was fine, but they kept a bedroom that's right above it.  i'm a heavy sleeper, but sleeping was impossible because the sound was equivalent to trying to fall asleep in the middle of a concert stage.  i had stayed here previously and was happy as a clam, but won't risk it again which is a shame because the people and location are otherwise great.  in short i wouldn't recommend staying here if you plan to sleep before 2-3am"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,great hostel. love they offer free brekky and they have different activities on each day and they even have an event guy come to the room to tell you what’s happening on the weekend. awesome. great location. constantly loud though. 
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staying at samesun venice was one of the best experiences of my life. the staff was so friendly! the place itself was so clean, and so beautiful. i met people from norway, chicago, and spain. i can't wait to go back again. i was very impressed by the bar/restaurant affiliated with samesun, and i just had the best time. they provide kitchen amenities, there are two refrigerators for personal use, and full kitchen access. again, the staff was amazing! friendly greetings and smiles. five stars!~   "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,6,6,6,10,"comfy bed and great having a carpet floor, great bathroom facilities. not the best with it's social side, hard to know a tourist in the bar. "
England,Female,18-24,5.1,2,6,2,6,8,6,6,so far away from the greyhound! took nearly three hours using public transport to get there! always queuing for bathrooms. breakfast is good but kitchen is tiny. 
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,10,6,6,great location and the staff were incredibly helpful. i’ll return again for sure. 
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.7,4,8,10,8,6,8,10,fantastic location. friendly staff. played very loud music in common room from as early as 6.30am. and sound carries a lot. so not great for travelers treasures sleep. 
USA,Female,25-30,6.6,6,10,4,6,8,6,6,while there were clean sheets and pillowcases it was unclear when the last time the duvet was cleaned. the location is definitely a huge tourist attract but there are many homeless people in the area and i didn't feel safe walking around there alone at night. 
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,best view ever! great location and breakfast was good too
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the beds are amazing!!! best nights sleep. everything is super clean. breakfast is really relaxed and well provided. little low on bathrooms, but there is not much they can do about that. really good location and fantastic staff. "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i'd stayed at on my trip :) amazing hostel for anyone travelling on their own - staff are so happy to help with any requests and the atmosphere is great. location amazing right on venice beach!!
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,great location!  very social environment 
Spain,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"really good facilities. location is good for venice beach, right by the beach. during the night is quite isolated and full of 'weird' people outside but they are not really dangerous so didnt feel unsafe at all. they are pretty friendly. common room is good and easy to make friends in as its always full of people up for a drink at night.  would recommend and would definitely stay again."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i've stayed in. amazing value for money, with an unbeatable location on the beach. the staff were friendly, and the dorms were clean and tidy. would recommend for the best experience on venice beach"
England,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,6,6,6,8,great location right on venice beach and the back of the building has a mural which is an instagram hotspot. enjoyed my stay but as a solo traveller found it difficult to mix. some activities seemed like a chore for staff and the communal area was pretty depressing - cmon guys its venice beach liven it up a bit! room i was in was always in darkness due to no natural light - made it a bit uncomfortable at times. 
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,can't beat this location if you want to chill at the beach! 
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"staff was great. very patient, very helpful, good to great attitudes.  room was safe and clean."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, decent rooms, and venice beach is seriously awesome, first stop on my trip and was easily one of my favourites. was lucky enough to get upgraded for free and all of the dorm mates were super chill people, i suppose la would attract a fairly interesting bunch. "
Germany,Couple,25-30,6,4,8,8,4,6,6,6,"direct at venice. not enough bathrooms and toilets. for one floor with dorms and double rooms are only 2 bathrooms with the toilet inside. rooms are small, bed not very comfy. for that expensive price you can get more"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great spot! kept extremely clean.
CzechRepublic,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,i was a little bit missing really a/c in my room. however great breakfast include of price. i could storage my luggege with out any  fee. staff was friendly and helpful. the location is best especial if you like beach life!
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"this hostel is in such an ideal location, a stone's throw from the beach. so good. the staff were super friendly and the free breakfast is nice. pancakes, woo!  big thing though, the bar downstairs (which has nice, well priced food) is insanely loud on fri/sat nights. i'm talking beds vibrating and pounding bass that doesn't stop until 1am. i get it, hostels are often loud and it's something i've always just accepted. but this was intense noise. other nights are okay though. "
USA,Female,31-40,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,8,6,"can't beat the location. overall it was fine and did the job, but as others have stated, the bathroom situation is a problem. if you shower at night and get up between 5am and 7am, you won't have to wait in line."
Ireland,Female,31-40,7.4,2,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location. breakfast was really good.  the internet was an absolute joke. did not work most of the time.  the value for money  was not good,a dorm room for over $50 is not on.  hostels should not be allowed charge over $50 for a dorm room regardless of the location or time of year. "
Croatia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,6,8,8,10,10,8,the staff was very pleasant and welcoming and the atmosphere in the hostel was great. you get the chance to mmet people in the eveneng in organised events like games in the bar.
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"fantastic location, right on the beach. the staff (shout out to jaquill) are super friendly, and the facilities are to a pretty good standard. the free breakfast is much better than i thought it would be, and the general vibe/atmosphere is amazing."
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,location is worth it. great little hostel literally on the beach - would stay here again! 
Paraguay,Female,25-30,8,6,10,10,8,8,10,4,good auto service breakfast! did not like the carpets in the rooms becaus a lot of the beach is just in front of it! they did not make up the beds but the bathroom was always clean! excelent location!! 
NewZealand,Couple,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,10,8,fantastic location right by the beach! we had good views of the beach from our room too. the bathroom situation was a little frustrating though as there were only two on our level and they both had showers in them so good luck going to the toilet in amongst all the showers and other people using the bathroom too. breakfast was crappy and once they ran out of something they didn't restock e.g nutella which was the only good thing about this breakfast. location made up for this though.
Brazil,Male,25-30,3.1,2,6,6,2,2,2,2,the staff at the hostel is very bad and rude. i asked at the reception to clean the restroom because it was so dirty and they just ignored me. the room is to hot and uncomfortable. definitely i do not recommend.
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,i love the samesun more each time i go there.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"enjoyed my two nights here. breakfast is good- toast, hard boiled eggs, orange juice, make your own pancakes. friendly staff and good vibes throughout. dorms are nicer than in the photos "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"it was so nice staying here! the location was great, very friendly staff and lots of activities going on! my roommates were also kind and funny. i would definitely go back!"
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is perfectly situated right on the beach front and is staffed by the friendliest people! they were spot on with recommendations for food and coffee, and how to get around and what to see. the place is quite kept clean and tidy and the beds are very comfortable - the perfect place to come back to after a long day of exploring what la has to offer! i highly recommend this hostel to anyone and everyone!"
USA,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,8,6,4,8,best part about the hostel is the location. whoever was working when i got in one night wasn't very nice at all. breakfast had hard boiled eggs that weren't done (so couldn't eat). the room was warm and stuffy. ceiling leaked. overpriced. 
PuertoRico,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first time at a hostel. great time.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"staff were so friendly, they could not have been anymore welcoming. the hostel is in a perfect setting and you get discount at the bar downstairs. only thing is i never needed my card to get into the building because the door never seemed to shut properly. "
Australia,Male,18-24,4,4,4,8,2,4,4,2,beds were filthy and the staff weren't exactly knowledgable or helpful apart from one girl who took us on a hike. rooms and the bathrooms were terrible. 
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,6,10,"killer location and really comfy beds/pillows. surprisingly quite dark and quiet rooms for being on such an active street, once the windows are closed and blinds drawn. i just stayed one night so didn't have time to try any of the organized activities, but they looked to have a good variety throughout the week! i would return if i found myself wanting some beach time in venice again. "
France,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,8,10,"nice hostel, right at venice beach (which is a more sketchy area than expected). the staff is very nice and the breakfast is not bad at all. rooms can be a little noisy since the building is on the street, but it is clearly fine. "
England,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,8,8,8,6,great hostel with an awesome location. only drawback was that there was only one toilet and shower on each floor.
England,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"this hostel is fine but out of the 5 i've stayed in during my trip this was definitely my least favourite. the 'shared washroom' in my 4bed dorm was a sink in the corner which i think is a bit of a joke. there were 2 mixed-sex bathrooms on my floor which was not even nearly enough, every time i wanted to use the restroom/clean teeth etc i had to wait. they organised trips out but generally atmosphere was a little stale. permanent happy hour for guests at bar below hostel was a big bonus though. "
England,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,10,4,2,6,8,great location. but a complete rip off for what you get. tiny room and poor customer service at reception. worst i've stayed in. 
Indonesia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"only stayed for one night but the location was amazing right one the beach , staff was amazing but those stairs are killer with a bag .     would recommend! "
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this is my first time to stay in samesun venice beach and i would say that i had a great experience. great location,  price is very reasonable, free breakfast, and the staff are very helpful and friendly especially katya in the front desk. will definitely come back..      zaldy zamora  sacramento, ca"
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,"location is unbelievable. that's by far the best part about this place. my room had no ac which made the night pretty miserable, but it was still worth it. breakfast was mediocre. would stay again. "
Philippines,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"overall very nice! clubhop on friday night was awesome! (maybe just a bit overpriced) 😉  just a couple of small improvement suggestions, i dunno how it is in the other rooms, but my room was so hot! i recommend either installing air condition or getting more and stronger fans!  also, breakfast was quite ok, but could have had more variety (e.g. cream cheese)"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"had a great time here! staff was really helpful, even ran down the stairs to help me with my luggage. great discounts at the restaurant/bar downstairs, which has a cool nice-but-beachy vibe (and great food/drinks--get the korean fries). currently having some construction done in the stairwell but only during the day, and the maintenance folks were really friendly (would stop whenever someone opened the door to come through, didn't make a lot of noise early in the morning).  "
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect place to stay for venice beach
Canada,Female,18-24,4.9,2,10,10,2,6,2,2,not enough bathrooms for amount of people  not clean at all

NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location, right next to venice beach. hire bikes and cycle down to santa monica. rooms are clean and comfortable. friday night limo crawl was really fun. staff are helpful planning out daily activities. "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you want the venice beach experience stay at this hostel! it's practically on the beach! great facilities, free breakfast, quiet but sociable, and really friendly, helpful staff. plus the restaurant downstairs does delicious food. i would definitely stay there again :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,4,8,10,6,8,6,10,"nowhere near enough bathrooms for how many people there are but this seems standard in us hostels. reasonable rooms and breakfast, alright staff - location right on venice boardwalk is fantastic."

Wales,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"samesun is a great hostel right on venice beach. i stayed in a 4 bed female dorm, and the beds were clean and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and in good working order. laundry is $5 a bag and the staff have it ready for you the next day. the lockers aren't big enough to store a suitcase, but you can lock away plenty of valuables. the staff were very friendly and helpful. wifi was great. luggage storage was very cramped but that is to be expected! i'd stay here again."
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,well run hostel in the centre of venice beach. you couldn't ask for a better location. shame they can't make more of that roof terrace! 
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel, good location, good range of breakfast options. the staff were friendly as were most other guests. "
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"cannot fault this place. was booked in until 30th july then went off to hollywood but have ended up coming back here instead! amazing location (could not get closer to the beach apart from sleeping on it!) great staff amd very welcoming. if you are coming to venice, stay here."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,6,10,10,10,8,10,had a great stay at venice beach. dorms are clean and beds so comfy and good size. only issue would be our door did not shut properly so was not fully secure. breakfast was good and staff very helpful. location could not have been better for venice beach!! 
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i've stayed so far! the location is one block from venice beach. you have discounts for a bar which is next to the hostel. people and staff are very friendly.  beds are very comfortable. everything is clean!  i'll defenitely be back in this hostel.     my suggestion: add a foosball table in the living room :)
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,4,10,"perfect location by the beach. atmosphere is almost non-existant though, and you wont find much nightlife around venice beach"
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,4,10,6,8,clean hostel with great location. not enough bathrooms for all the people who are staying there. 
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel! awesome staff and perfect location. would stay again!
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a great hostel with an amazing location. very clean and so close to all of venice. get a skatey, get right involved. the venice ale house does great beers. the sunset is perfect holiday material. enjoy! "
NewZealand,MixedGroup,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,great place to stay if you want a quick stroll to disneys theme parks. spa and pool are perfect to relax in. great value for money and friendly!

Scotland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great place to stay for a few days, right on the beach which is perfect!!   free breakfast every morning although it's mainly just toast and cut oranges. wish there was more of a selection.   security wise, i was never asked to show my room card going in but that was only because my floor was above reception to i didn't need to pass them on my way. that being said i never once felt unsafe during my stay.   overall i would recommend this hostel for anyone looking for somewhere in the la area!!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,awesome place to stay! close to the beach; area not the best but the hostel itself is super cool. lots of fun activities and fun people running them. would definitely stay again!
Scotland,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,6,10,"nice place, staff are laid back and helpful. they offer free towels.   each bed has a little shelf with light and power which is excellent.   free breakfast and cheap laundry   powerful and steady temperature in the showers.  there is a music venue down stairs which goes until about 12pm. so not ideal if you're planning to do day trips where you have to get up early.  but if you want somewhere to sleep near the beach area, this is perfect for you. also close to lax airport (about $25 uber)"
Australia,Couple,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"the wifi dropped in and out. the power points did not work. the roof leaked and the staff didn't seem to care. breakfast was ok, staff was ok. location was great. shower always seemed to be dirty/sandy. "
France,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,"staff was really nice and helpful.   the wifi doesn't always work though.   otherwise, everything was great, i will probably come back here if i come to venice beach!"
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,6.3,6,8,6,6,8,4,6,"staff at the front desk are helpful and will answer any questions you have.  clean hostel, with no issues at all, toilets were clean, shower was clean and bed sheets were clean.  good location if you are into beach activities such as surfing otherwise driving is the only option to get to other touristy places such as hollywood and beverly hills.   security was average, could be improved by asking guests to show their cards at front desk"
Scotland,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"good hostel. very helpful with luggage storage and let me have showers before and after i checked out which was great when going from the beach to the airport. excellent location for venice,hipster eateries and snta monica and just as difficult as the rest of la to get anywhere else! gets noisy at night in the front rooms, slightly cramped building and no air con in my room so got a bit warm.  nightly activities,mostly drinking related (i went on the limo club tour which was fun). helpful staff."
Finland,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"only stayed for one night but enjoyed it. location is really awesome, right at the beach and the hollywood limo ride was super fun! great and helpful staff. iwould definitely  recommend"
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,8,8,6,"venice beach is probably where you want to stay when visiting la - and this samesun was right by the boardwalk. price was okay, there's a basic breakfast included, plus they make a good effort to run an event every evening. i'd definitely go back here."
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,8,6,"this is a party hostel so set your expectations. it gets loud at night. bathrooms aren't that clean and are barely functional. the beds smell a bit musty and if it isn't a cool night the rooms are going to be stuffy. it is right on venice beach however, near bus stops, and the people staying are friendly."
Lithuania,Couple,25-30,6,4,8,10,4,4,6,6,"the location of this hostel is great. everything else is ok or bad. we stayed in it because it has such good reviews, but i'm really surprised it does. they did not clean the room/change sheets even once in four days/three nights we were there. it was extremely humid and there was no a/c--it's extremely unpleasant to be inside a hot and humid room. internet was unreliable and a pain in the rear. the staff was unhelpful and unreliable. i've got more to say, but no more characters left. "
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"awesome stay. they had overbooked and put the two of us in separate rooms by accident but happily upgraded us to a private room instead of a dorm. amazingly accommodating. great facilities, awesome location on the beach and amazing food at the downstairs restaurant. "
Ireland,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,full price for staying at the hostel was not clear which led to misunderstanding.  great location and good standard of cleanliness.
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"samesun is at an excellent location, in venice beach just steps from the actual ocean. the staff was very knowledgeable, they offered a filing breakfast, the room was clean. the only complaint is that we got a room with no outside window, so our room got really warm since we were on the third floor."
Mexico,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"the location is amazing. i could see the beach from the room window, it's that close to it. my stay was great. the staff was friendly and i really appreciated the luggage room. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"perfect location right on venice beach, staff are awesome and make you feel welcome.   for once a decent mattress on the beds, activities on most nights - if not there is plenty to do around the area! "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,awesome spot  staff super friendly and happy to help  private rooms are awesome for the price 
Iran,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for! the location was unbeatable. you are literally on the venice boardwalk and the room i stayed in had a great view!"
Australia,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"nice and clean, helpful staff, wifi speed could be a lot better"
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was pretty nervous because i never have stayed in a hostel. i was made welcome and i was pleasantly surprised by the accommodations. clean and comfortable. i felt very safe. just so cool that it was right at the heart of venice! i'm very pleased. ~michelle from albuquerque nm
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,6,10,10,10,8,10,10,great place to stay...they do pub crawls which are super fun.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,8,10,"great location right on venice beach, not really the sociable hostel however the bar is apparently under construction, so it'll be a lot better when that's up and running!  "
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,i loved my stay here.   the location was perfect and easy to bike around and up to santa monica pier. you can hire a bike from jays cheaply right next door.   the facilities were fantastic. and the area whilst right in the centre of venice board walk was not at all too noisy. would definitely stay here again. 
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,"only 2 bathrooms (1 toilet and 1 shower each) on each floor of the hostel (only 2 floors too), this was very inconvenient since there are 4+ people staying in each room and tons of rooms on each floor. very close to the venice beach boardwalk (very very crowded boardwalk). the hostel was doing some renovations to their stairwell so there was a lot of paint chips on the ground and dust. breakfast was what you would expect at a hostel. "
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,staff was amazing! location was perfect to walk along venice beach!!!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,6,10,10,"excellent location, 3 minute walk to the beach. staff would help with any problems you had but wouldn't be overly excited to do so. only 1 common room which is fairly small so quite easy to meet people. would recommend!"
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,it was okay and location was good
USA,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,4,10,6,6,"mediocre hostel in an excellent location with great staff. breakfast is nice but a cramped common room and kitchen is annoying. facilities aren't great. location is excellent, which is the only reason to stay here. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"right on venice beach, a few km stroll from santa monica pier and right near plenty of places to grab a drink!  wish there were more group activities on thursday nights because we were hoping to meet people and party with a crew (but all you can eat tacos is a cute idea anyway!)  staff were pretty good, lots of cleaning going on all the time which was good for making it feel clean, but tricky because the number of bathrooms was limited!  breakfast was fantastic!! such a good wake up idea!  "
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,"good location. rooms were clean, however i was in a seven bed and therefore had a single bed. none of the plugs around me worked and everyone had extension leads attached to their bunk beds but i did not. when i asked why the plugs didn't work at the front desk, the workers response was ""i'm not an electrician"" therefore thought the staff were abit unhelpful   apart from this the hostel is nice and cheaper than other hostels in la "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay and experience the best of venice beach. amazing views over the boardwalk and ocean, clean rooms with good wifi and free breakfast in the morning to start your day (pancakes included). really friendly and helpful staff and will definitely be back to visit when i'm in l.a again. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,really cool hostel right on venice beach. breakfast was great and all the facilities you could need :)
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,8,8,great location i must say. right by the beach (literally) and quite a few places to eat outside. major downside is that its a communal bathroom (which i don't mind) but there's only 2 bathrooms for the entire floor meaning tons of waiting in the morning when you just gotta take a leak. and i don't understand the passport policy. i am american and good thing i have a passport (most don't). you really think people will try and stay longer w/o paying? they require to show next travel destination.
USA,MixedGroup,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,samesun venice is always amazing! i'd live there if i could.
England,Female,31-40,6.3,6,4,10,4,6,6,8,"clean, great breakfast included and location hard to beat. front door doesn't lock, ever, so security could be better."
Brunei,Female,41+,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,6,8,the location of the hostel is good as it is just in front of the beach.
Netherlands,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"the best hostel i stayed in during my west coast trip! amazing location (my room had a ocean view!) and the rooms were super nice. very spacious, one of the best hostel beds i've ever encountered and the ensuite bathroom was great as well. there were plenty of activities organized by the hostel where you could make friends very easily, and the staff was very helpful. the kitchen and common room are a little bit cramped, but during the activity nights this only helped in meeting people!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,6,10,"a short stay to get over jet lag. did exactly what it was meant to. a place for me to lay low for a couple of nights, go wandering along the beach, hit some cool bars around venice + santa monica. great location, great vibe along the board walk. the staff were very accommodating. if i was staying longer i would have liked somewhere with a larger common space to get to know my fellow travellers, i found most were quite closed off and in their zone but only a minor bump in an otherwise great stay."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,10,6,2,8,8,"when i got to the hostel we were told to pay for the days we would be staying. we were charged usd 18 extra. we asked for a refund which was accepted by the staff at samesun however, i have still not received the money. this blows! "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"liked it so much i extended from two to five nights. took the four bed mixed dorm and was so happy with it, window view onto venice beach, our own bathroom and a nice and clean room. was a little more pricey than the eight bed dorms but totally worth it! had cleaners come every day, breakfast was included(toast, butter and jam, pancakes, eggs) and there were activities every night, the best was mario cart with beers. met cool people and venice beach was a one min walk away. close to la transit. "
Australia,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"small hostel with limited communal areas, nice vibe and clean....location cant be better for venice beach. be prepared for lots of homeless outside especially at night bit sketchey late ...beautiful beach location short walk to santa monica....lots of stalls for t shirts and souvenirs "
England,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,"stayed for over night in a 4-bed en-suite room. was clean and well organised. the kitchen and communal areas are a bit small, especially around breakfast time, and the toaster conveyor wasn't working. other than this a great night's stay."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, great staff, and clean, quiet rooms."
Latvia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location,"
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,10,6,10,10,4,4,10,guest were very nice but the night staff were rude. one dude especially. i didn't understand the valuables room on the check-in floor. it totally not secure. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"i loved staying here!! usually i don't believe reviews that say it was in a sketchy area but this hostel was in a bit of a sketchy area. homeless people would sit right outside the hostel and fights were broken up by he police right outside the hostel. this being said, just use common sense! don't walk alone at night and that sort of thing. the atmosphere is amazing in this hostel!!! met so many amazing people from all over the world. "
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"location is perfect, literally couldn't be closer to venice beach, the views are stunning.   rooms are really nice and the facilities are good. showers are enormous.  there's a nice lounge area and met some really cool people.   bars are a little bit far away."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,8,10,was a really nice hostel. clean and comfortable beds. a good group of travellers staying. only downside is there is very little night life around the hostel after about 8pm and if you want to visit a lot of the main attractions it is a fair drive. but overall a great place to enjoy the beach. 
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,location is perfect for venice / small walk from santa monica. i was placed in a room with a view out to the sea front and that was my highlight! it was unbelievable! staff were really helpful. lounge area could be improved but other than that i was really happy with my stay! 
India,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,6,8,10,8,10,great hostel. area can be a bit sketchy at night. they also had someone take over my bed after i got home first night and threw away some items (socks) i had on the bed. but yea decent place overall. 
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed in a 4 bedroom dorm with 3 strangers. it was a great experience meeting new people.    the breakfast in the morning was good &amp; free - it was make your own pancakes and had orange juice as well as toast. the lounge area was tidy and had a tv playing sports in hd. the view outside the lounge was looking over the beach, too.    the room was good size with good beds, as well as lockers (you bring your own lock). bathroom was clean, too. showers hot/cold worked well."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great place overall! only downside is there are only 5 bathrooms to cover two floors.. meant waiting a little while to get into a bathroom if you chose to shower at the wrong time! 
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,nicely located hostel with nice social atmosphere
England,Female,25-30,7.4,4,8,10,6,8,8,8,"average backpacker accommodation, felt a bit run down but was clean enough and had the basics. breakfast was really good, but for the high price you're paying you kind of hoped it would be decent! great location on venice beach, but also very expensive for what it is. though that may just be the la norm."
England,Female,25-30,5.4,6,6,8,4,2,6,6,good location close to beach but grotty hostel and staff customer service is pretty poor. 
Australia,Couple,25-30,5.7,2,10,10,4,4,4,6,"i think samesun was absolutely extortionate for what it was. we payed approx  $600 usd for 4 nights in a single room. the single room consisted of a double bed, and that was all. the window faced on to a brick wall. the bed was so uncomfortable, after a long flight from sydney this was so disappointing.   the staff at the front desk were miserable and offered no help. we arrived at 8am (after a 22 hour flight) and they refused to give us a towel for a shower until our check in time of 3pm"
Germany,Male,18-24,5.4,4,6,10,4,4,4,6,"great location, but the staff was not to friendly.     there were only three bathrooms for a whole storage. "
Wales,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"really friendly and welcoming place, guests and staff all lovely. room was a little but cramped, but not uncomfortably so. great location- so close to the beach. loved the whole stay."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"short stop over trip before flying else, so can't comment too much on the hostel but clean, good facilities and easy to get to in can/shuttle from airport(40min in traffic, 15-20min early morning). great location for venice beach. would stay again for a short stop over. "
China,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"the location is perfect! i could see the sea from my window   the stuffs were very nice and helpful   the breakfast was ok, you could get coffee, orange juice, bread and so on  it is a good idea to stay there if you wanna enjoy the beach and sun! "
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,great location! so close to the beach
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay, met a lot of cool people, great facilities and just the atmosphere you'd expect from a hostel. had a blast"
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"great location, close to the boardwalk.   be advice, the boardwalk gets really sketchy at night."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great place! was only here for two nights, but i got upgraded from a seven bed to a four which was nice. beautiful ocean front view, loved it! also liked that they came around to the rooms to tell us about the activities that happened.  power went out for about six hours though one day which was weird and slightly annoying.  lastly, construction is going on underneath the hostel so if you're on the second floor it's very noisy!  overall great hostel though"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,i always stay at this hostel when in la. location is amazing on venice beach (best chinese restaurant only a block away - mao's kitchen). easy access to public transport to get around the rest of la. super comfy beds and the staff are brilliant. activities run by the hostel everyday and it's an easy spot to meet fellow travellers. highly recommend. 
England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,rooms were cramped compared to other hostels and residents loud.  breakfast was good.
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"it's a pretty old hostel, but has a lot of character. we stayed in a 4 bed dorm which was pretty small but it had a sink in the room. the free breakfast is hard boiled eggs, toast, oats or pancakes good variety. the bathrooms were always clean. the hostel feels a little pokey just due to the way it's built. plenty of unisex bathrooms to use. common area is small but ok. the best thing was the location! right on venice beach :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing, venice beach is beautiful. the staff there are really helpful and fun. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"in the past couple years i have stayed at all the hostels in los angeles area and found samesun hostel one of the best. the location is terrific and many of the room have ocean view. the room are good size with comphy beds and also includes locker (bring your own lock). fri and sat night activities are super fun too. special thanks to the amazing, friendly staff for making my stay hostel experience best ever: sara (manager), sam (front desk) and ryder (activity host)! -shaft"
Sweden,Female,18-24,7.7,4,10,8,8,8,8,8,"only stayed one night as a passover before my flight, but seemed like a nice place. area outside the hostel got a little sketchy when it got dark but u don't get much closer to venice beach. too expensive for me for a shared dorm room "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant location, super clean and chilled atmosphere. would stay again."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,"the most comfortable beds i've ever slept on in a hostel! strong wifi connection and clean facilities and amenities. staff were helpful and the location is 10/10 - right in front of of the beach and muscle beach, walking distance to santa monica. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,awesome place to stay   although it was getting renovated at the time the common room had a great vibe   hostel had organised trips / games night and pub crawls   directly across from the beach my room had a great view :)   fantastic place ! ☺️
England,Female,18-24,7.7,6,10,10,8,6,6,8,"communal areas aren't big enough particularly at breakfast times, also there were a lot of flies inside. room was very clean though and security very good. had an amazing view of the beach from my room too."
Canada,Female,41+,5.4,2,8,8,4,6,6,4,not very clean. really small room. really noisy from water dripping. left in the middle of the night to move to another location. pretty expensive for a hostel.
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,8,6,"awesome location!!! easy access to transit (buses), but right on the beach. literally. staff is super helpful, the atmosphere is inviting, and free breakfast is always a plus!! the activities are wicked so take advantage!!"
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,4,8,10,6,"bed is comfy and location is ideal. great breakfast includes pancakes, boiled eggs, different types of breads, and fruits. shower would be problem because they have limited number of booths. that should be updated."
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had an awesome stay and the best roommates
Canada,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"stayed here for 4 nights with my mate jeremy. everything was freaking awesome and we met some really cool people in our room, the only bad thing was this guy from texas would hangout in the common room and get belligerently drunk and would yell at everyone and was just downright annoying. pretty much had to stay away from the common room just to avoid him.      but yeah other than that the hostel was freaking amazing."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a great atmosphere! i stayed here for 2 nights and made new friends instantly :) the hostel has daily activities which is great for solo travellers. you must be cool with a flight or 2 of stairs to stay here (no lift). the common room is small but comfortable so good if you like chatting to others! 
NorthernIreland,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,staff great and location fantastic
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location, delicious breakfast, comfy beds, really clean and the staff were all lovely and helpful. cant recommend highly enough. its well worth paying a bit extra"

Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,"my friend and i stayed at this hostel.   positive things: - towels for free, even beach towels - 24h reception  - discount on skate/bike rentals around the corner  - sink in the rooms, unfortunately no soap or (paper)towels - very close to the beach  negative aspects: - only 3 bathrooms on each floor. our room had 8 people, idk how much we're in the other rooms but even if it's only 4, that's not enough. 1 bathroom= 1 toilet stall + shower - probably not the safest spot in town "
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very delighted with my experience. i am not the usual millennial backpacker but a middle-aged person with a suitcase. nonetheless, the staff were gracious and helpful. it was blissfully quiet at night  (sunday) despite the buzz of activity and music out on the street all afternoon. i bought ear plugs but didn't need them. there is a long staircase to negotiate coming in but the staff helped me get my heavy bag down when i checked out. i would definitely stay there again!"
Canada,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"great location,  1 minute walk to the beach. rooms are overall good. more expensive the other hostels but good price for a beach view."

Canada,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"what a fantastic location.  across the street from venice beach boardwalk and ocean on the one side and on the other great bars (rooftop too!) and food. comfy bed and bedding, quiet, safe and overall a great choice.  didn't have the breakfast so i can't comment on that."

USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,super chill and affordable hostel right on benice beach ! rent a bike and cruise ! it's a close bike ride to santa monica . on wed the have a farmers market so take advantage of that ! 
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"if you want to explore venice beach, this is the place to be - you're right at the entrance, you can see the sea from your dorm window. it's a little more expensive than the nearby hostels so you decide if it's worth it. they have activities often enough - check their calendar."
CapeVerde,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome awesome, very clean and the staff is really cool. keep up the good work. "

Latvia,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location just right at venice beach. many bars &amp; restaurants to hang out at night, great sand &amp; ocean to see in the morning / afternoon.  the facilities were nice &amp; clean. good to have toilet &amp; bathrooms inside the room.  breakfast was good, just what's needed for a good start of the day!"

Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very good
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,perfect location - centrally located in the middle of the venice beach broad walk. i stayed in a 4 bedded room right next to the lounge area - got very noisy and was hard to sleep. one lady at check in seems to just not want to be there and is quite blunt. other than that all of the other staff are lovely and the facilities are well kept. room and kitchen were clean. bar crawl was not organised properly by the hostel and people were left waiting around wondering what was going on.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,"i found this hostel a little disappointing as i had heard great things about samesun. it's a little small and the layout is a little strange for generating any kind of community environment. however, the facilities and cleanliness was pretty good and the staff were friendly and helpful. "
France,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, staff is amazing, best location to visit and to enjoy venice beach ! great facilities and very good breakfast ! "

USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,great place. would definitely recommend it.  
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,we had a private room. it was clean and nice but the overall place was cramped and kind of dingy. bathrooms were kind of gross too by the end of the day. it was crowded in the morning for breakfast. location is good though. staff were pretty nice and inclusive. 
France,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,"the location on venice beach is amazing, especially for daytime activities! at night, the area seems slightly shady and not so lively despite a couple of bars nearby but i still felt safe. we had a private room and it was expensive for what we got. there was a small window overlooking dark courtyard so not much natural light in the room. the water going through the pipe was super noisy. besides, the number of bathrooms is limited and the kitchen is small. it does not seem to be a social hostel."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8,8,6,10,6,8,10,8,"samesun was amazing, on the best spot if you want to know both venice and santa monica.  it's not really safe on the streets at night so going out was kind of hard but it was a cool experience"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"enjoyed my stay, but it was expensive for what it was."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,highly recommend this hostel. the staff were amazing so so friendly.  you and your belongings are incredible protected at all times. amazing night outs with their tours and events. and everything was super clean 10/10
USA,Male,31-40,5.4,4,4,6,6,4,6,8,"while some of the staff was very helpful...others were outright awful. got back to my room one evening to find they'd opened my locker and removed my stuff stating ""it wasn't my room"" which was total rubbish....the employee who had checked me in the night before had  moved to a new room because the room i was supposed to have was an absolute disaster. you couldn't walk in the room it was so bad. the breakfast is nice. the common areas are ok. the are is fun. i will never stay here again though. "
Canada,Male,18-24,5.1,6,4,6,8,6,2,4,a girl in my 6 bed dorm managed to sneak her friend into the room. the staff did not do anything about it. the ensuite toilet was quite dirty. the room walls are paper thin.
Albania,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,the best place to stay in venice!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the samesun venice beach was so much fun. the people there were friendly, the staff so good to talk to a get things to do for the day. anything negative i have to say about it absolutely means nothing in comparison to the good things i have to say. the locations great and there is plenty to do on the beach even if it's just walk around. definitely a great place to stay. "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"well, samesun disproves all my previous experiences that hostels must be dirty and uncomfortable...it was not!  very clean and well taken care of, pleasant staff, very nice breakfast, very comfortable beds, very clean and frequently serviced bathrooms....plus a great location with very good security.  don't mind the couple flights of stairs to get to reception...it's all a breeze from there.  i just stayed for a quick overnight, but i'm sure samesun would be nice for longer stays too. good job!"
Brazil,Male,31-40,6.6,4,4,6,8,10,8,6,i was in room near the common area. extremely noisy. 
Colombia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a short but nice stay, very clean and organized. breakfast was the best part of it. very lively atmosphere, awesome staff.  perfect location for enjoying the beach or going out at night.  the only downside was that it has only 4 toilets for like 50 people, so it's easy to end up waiting in line in order to use one."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,8,6,"la is gross but this hostel is nice, right by the beach"

USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here!!  it wasn't necessarily the hostel itself, but the people staying there made it for one of the best times i've had traveling!!"
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,6,2,6,8,great location but the staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. beds where very comfortable. 
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly, helpful staff! "
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"nice room, nice and fun staff, secure entrance, ample paid and free parking options, great at offering night-life activities for meeting people. amazing location for the beach, juice, vegan and raw options. lots of noise at night from night life - but i expected that. mornings and daylight were my favorite here as my traditional night life desires have become more about relaxation and solitude, and now i'm much more into health and feeling good instead of partying, but still had fun at night!"
Sweden,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"had an issue with the hostel overcharging me (they did not admit that the deposit paid through hw was part of the rate) and the staff who handled it (onsite as well as via email) was clueless. i had to go through hw to get the refund, and even then the transaction failed somewhere so i had to complain to the card issuer. it's an ok hostel, a bit cramped, lots of stairs but no elevator, but not the best i've been to."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i visited in the us. so good i decided to go back!
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,very clean rooms! perfect location very nice staff wonderful stay.

USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hands down the best hostel in which i've ever stayed. the staff is consistently warm and nice. the facilities are clean and feel extremely safe. i've met some fascinating people here from all across the globe, who came here to have a great time, and be awesome people. with the organized bar crawls, the karoake, and taco tuesday, i've had nothing but the greatest experience so far. i even extended my stay for a week. yeah. it was that fun. "
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"the atmosphere was great, and the breakfast even better. i was only here for two days but i felt super comfortable here."
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"perfect location right on the beach, friendly staff, good breakfast, comfy beds. would definitely come back! "
France,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing place to stay. 
Australia,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,8,6,4,8,"i didn't particularly enjoy my 3 night stay at venice beach. as a solo female traveller, i didn't feel safe in the area itself so that put a downer on my stay. staff weren't as friendly or helpful as one would expect. wifi barely worked when i was there. each floor only had 2 toilets and showers, which were in the same room so couldn't be used if occupied. breakfast was good though."
USA,Male,31-40,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,8,"good people, good spot if venice beach is your thing."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"it doesn't get much better than samesun venice beach.  the location is idyllic, literally a few steps away from the tumbling waves of the pacific ocean, and other noteworthy los angeles points of interest.  the dorm rooms are large, each bunk equipped with plush mattresses and fresh sheets daily.  each room is air conditioned, and some contain private bathrooms.  i was particularly impressed by the variant free breakfast, from eggs and pancakes to fruit, juice, tea and coffee.  i loved it. "
USA,Female,25-30,5.1,4,4,8,6,8,2,4,the location is great but they should have a travelers/backpackers only requirement.  i had two random guys come in the middle of the night and sleep off their drunkenness and get up early and leave --- they were beyond disgusting and making the worst noises i have ever heard anyone make while sleeping.  not a good experience at all. 
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a very brief stay at this hostel on a trip through la and was very happy. i arrived late at night and was greeted by a friendly face at reception and given good advice about parking, restaurants, and other bits and pieces.  the room was nice, spacious, clean and even had a view over venice beach. the bed was incredibly comfortable.  breakfast was enough to get you going in the morning, which is all you want.  i definitely recommend this hostel to anyone looking for a place in venice beach."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is my favorite hostel that i have stayed in. it is right on the main section of the boardwalk, it is an easy walk or bike ride to the santa monica pier, there are great places to get food (especially coffee and ice cream) right near by, and you get to make pancakes and toast for breakfast which is a nice change form the pre packaged breakfasts you typically get elsewhere. this hostel has the best sense of community i have experienced while traveling in the states. everyone is very friendly."
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,10,10,4,the location is this amazing and makes everything. its just next to venice beach. overall its a bit chaotic but its worth its money.
Chile,Male,25-30,8,6,10,10,6,8,6,10,"good location, clean and safe.  venice beach is nice during day time."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i have stayed at three other hostels in southern california area and found samesun hostel the best. great location, fun activities, great hostel mates from all over the world, love the laundry service and breakfast! but the best part about this hostel is the people who work there. special shout out to sarah, sam, and ryder for their awesomeness!!!          "
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this is honestly the best hostel i've ever stayed at. the atmosphere was so laid back and conducive to meeting new people. the pub crawl dom led on monday night was one of the best nights i've ever had out. if i ever find myself in la again, i wouldn't think twice before booking this hostel again. "
Austria,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good location directly at venice beach. small lockers, basic breakfast, great views on the beach, might get loud in the morning (music from venice beach), everything clean and fine! good pub crawl as well :)"
India,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, great food. its in venice beach, so great location. but not easy to reach from the airport. but since it is cost to the airport, can take a cab"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,great hostel right on venice beach. dominic was a legend
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"good location right on venice beach. vibe wasn't that social, and not the cleanest hostel, but still pretty good."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,8,8,8,8,6,had a blast. the people really made it! we had heaps of fun and created a good atmosphere. not many organised activities over new years and it could have been a little 'nicer'/cleaner. thanks 🙏🏻 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,6,10,"excellent location, not so great for solo travellers."
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,6,10,8,6,8,6,great location easy to walk out to venice beach and bars and restaurants. good breakfast included in the morning.  dorm rooms are spacious. staff could be a little friendlier 
Canada,MixedGroup,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"very good location. beside venice beach (not that close to santa monica pier, though). close to lax.   nice staff.    breakfast included, but we didn't know it would end at 10 am.  we barely made it for breakfast.  kitchen staff was helpful.  the whole hostel was clean, incl. the en-suite bathroom.  but if your room doesn't have a bathroom, you may need to fight for a shared one outside. it seemed there were only 2 shared bathrooms on each level. entrance stairs had strange odor, but not elsewhere."
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i spent my xmas here in 2016 with a bunch of strangers from different countries &amp; backgrounds. i had so much fun here! 
England,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place was fantastic! we stayed in a private room for two nights over christmas. the hostel organised lots of activities over the festive period, and everyone was so friendly. the location was fantastic and really gave us a taste of venice. the shared bathrooms were very clean and the property was very safe. we didn't want to leave! "
England,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,10,6,6,good location 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this hostel is in the absolute prime location. the rooms are clean and the free breakfast in the morning is good! the staff are especially accomodating, especially marvin who helped us when our flight had been cancelled! definitely recommend this hostel to anyone traveling to los angeles "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,great location cannot be beaten. atmosphere is so/so due to small common area.
India,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,8,8,10,"value for money, good location"
USA,Couple,18-24,9.1,4,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i enjoyed staying here, although for the price i believe guests should have the privilege of outside guests, especially if you have reserved a private room. "
Netherlands,Female,25-30,6.9,4,10,10,6,6,6,6,good location but expensive just like everything in la basically 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,6,8,10,10,10,"this hostel may look rough in the outside but on the inside it is amazing. great value for money and the staff are really nice.  there are many nice cafes and bars nearby and all within walking distance.     venice beach may not be the cleanest and have many homeless, but it is still a nice place to visit."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,perfect location for an early morning run along the beach. lockers are small. free breakfast gets the job done and only $15 uber from lax. can also get there via bus but it takes about an hour and feels a little unsafe travelling alone especially when it gets dark. limited food options around but a really chill place and right on the beach. 
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed my stay. i'm on a coastal camping trip by myself and this was my first stay in a hostel for the trip. the people were great, the staff was accommodating, and the location is perfect for exploring west la. must stay location. "
Estonia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing staff and clean, nice rooms. you also can't beat the location! highly reccommend!"
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location (minus the fact that venice basically shuts down after dark) with just a short walk to the beach. facilities were great; free breakfast and wifi were awesome; and they even let us keep our bags in storage after we checked out since we had a super late flight! 
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,8,10,"accomodation was really great, so close to venice beach. staff really lovely and had great suggestions. the deal with the laundry is a bonus too.  only thing is there's a lot of homeless people around so you feel a little unsafe at night, particularly when they are right on the doorstep of the hostel."
Philippines,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,one of the best hostels.
Wales,Male,31-40,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,"decent spot on venice beach, not too far from lax. overall fine - trips organised most nights and the wifi is good. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"hostel was in such a great location, staff couldn't have been more helpful.     overall a fantastic place to stay in the la. would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"i only stayed one night here but it was great. very clean, great atmosphere and awesome staff. right on the beach and there were some pretty cool bars right across the street.  "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"amazing spot, great staff, activities were awesome thanks to dom, would go back for sure."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place right in front of the beach - it's literally right there if you look out the dorm window. i was there only one night but they had a nice little outing to a nearby bar and then we all went to the club in front of the hostel.
Turkey,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"it was a clean and safe hostel, however my room was a bit small for 4 people, there was no window. "
USA,AllMaleGroup,41+,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"a friendly place, and helpful staff"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,4,10,8,10,"staff were great, good wifi and kitchen facilities but the number of bathrooms was a big problem for me - far too few, although i know this is not an easy fix. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"comfy bed, great vibe, plenty of lockers, nice hot breaky and plenty of activities suggested. only downfall was the lack of bathroom/ shower facilities and i was there during a quiet time :s"
Finland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"rooms were clean, shower was clean, common room was cool and kitchen spacy. only thing that bothered me was the nasty smell in the sleeping dorm. it smelled like sweat and dirtiness.     good place for a solo traveler!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,great hostel to stay at. right on venice beach. rooms are generous and very clean! would definitely recommend!

Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"friendly staff, clean, perfect location."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,4,10,8,10,6,8,"hostel was pretty good, however the neighbourhood wasn't so safe. someone got stabbed to death at the end of the street, random teenage youths always out the front of the hostel begging for smokes and cash. maybe that's how it is in venice/l.a. would stay again if they had security at the front door."
USA,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,6,6,8,10,officious morning staff is very rude in their instructions to guests.
England,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,this was one of our favourite hostels of the entire trip. great wifi which is always appreciated. the rooms were clean and spacious. the shelves next to the bed with charging port/lamp was also really handy. staff were always friendly and helpful. we liked it so much we left our other hostel early and came back to venice for another 2 nights!
Colombia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"the beds and rooms are comfortable.  the bathrooms are clean and wide. the breakfast was difficult, but not a real problem. i enjoyed my stay in venice beach, the hostel is well located."
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice place, i enjoyed the company!"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location to spend time at the beach. i arrived 5 hours before check in expecting to put my stuff in storage but they had my room ready. i also had to cancel one night of my stay &amp; sam was great in sorting that out &amp; giving me a refund. thanks dude! free breakfast was nice. plugs &amp; lamp by the bed- such a plus. no complaints. i'll be going back for sure. 
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel. amazing location just 2 second walk from the broad walk and a 10 minute walk to abbot kinney blvd. i stayed in a 4 bed female dorm and it was really comfortable, bathroom was clean and they had lockers. the breakfast in the morning was good, eggs, pancakes, coffee, i bought a few more bits to add to it. met lots of lovely people and th staff are so friendly too. i would 100% stay here again "
Israel,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"מקום סימפטי, צוות נחמד ומאיר פנים, אווירה נעימה  wifi   חינם גם בחדרים.  יש ארוחה בוקר צנועה וכל אחר צריך לשטוף את הצלחת שלו.  יש מקלחות בחדרים.  נקי ומסדר.  נמצא ממש על החוף.  מומלץ.  "
Ireland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved this hostel. the private room with seaview was wonderful and excellent value for money. sara and her team were professional and welcoming.  
Belgium,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good location, very centrical. the breakfast was what would bring me back here any time of the week... "
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really great place to stay. the location is what brought me there but in the end everything about the hostel including the staff was great. also very accessible from lax.
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,great location and good value for money.   the hostel only has 3 shared bathrooms for the whole facility (as in one toilet and a shower in each bathroom) which was a little frustrating in the morning. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,hostel is right on venice beach
Portugal,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"nice place to stay near venice beach. easy to reach and close to everything close to venice. the surrounding area was only active during the weekend. the facilities are a ""no thrills"" place. it is ok. if you need a clean, secure place to crash, this is your place. good price/value. don't forget to bring your own padlock, to close your stuff in the metal lockers (in the room). otherwise you can buy one in reception (7 bucks at the time of this writing). overall: recommended!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here for an extended stay and it was a great experience. free breakfast is on point, hard boiled eggs/make your own pancakes, coffee/tea. facilities were very clean, beds are comfortable. staff was super accommodating during my long stay. sam went above and beyond for me multiple times, if management is reading this give this guy a raise. staff comes around and knocks on the room doors every so often to make sure everyone is included in the events. super secure entry."
Austria,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i ve ever stayed!!

Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,not a bad hostel. it was so difficult to bring my suitcases up the big staircases to reception after a long flight as a solo traveller. the 4 bed room with an ensuite that i stayed in was clean and tidy. great location &amp; hostel staff were nice. 
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"samesun venice beach has to be the best hostel i have stayed in. i woke up and looked out my window to the beautiful palm trees of venice beach. perfect location, absolutely top notch amenities, friendly staff.     100% would and will stay again!    thanks samesun venice beach "

Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,"good spot to stay location wise, close enough to walk to santa monica pier and see the sights of venice beach.   wouldn't say it was the safest neighbourhood for after dark though.   public transport close by made it easy to get to and from everything else, including the airport. rooms and bathrooms were all kept nice. "
SouthAfrica,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"quite expensive, but probably normal for this area. right on venice beach is nice, but probably not the ultimate location overall. otherwise great stay, &amp; good opportunities for socializing."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"plans changed and unfortunately had to cancel my stay so it's a bit hard to give a proper review, the staff were really friendly over the phone but :) "

USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"for being a first time solo female traveler, and never having stayed in a hostle before, this was amazing. you had to get buzzed into the building, security cameras everwhere, and a 24 hour front desk. the quiet hours are at 11pm, which is so appreciated for those of us who have to get up early. the group activity was awesome. i will for sure stay here again if i'm in lax."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a great place.

Netherlands,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"right next to the beach (boulevard was a little deserted at night though, maybe due to low season). nice discounts on several bike rentals nearby, good showers and staff is friendly and helpful (especially sam)."
Norway,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location is unbeatable! had a great stay in their double room with private bathroom, it was perfect. you're right on the beach, the view is great and the staff are friendly and helpful. if you want to experience venice beach, this is the place to stay, wopuld definitely both come back and recommend!! :d"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i've stayed in.  a true business vs other hostels that are merely somebody with an extra building who wants to make some extra money. highly recommend

England,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"awesome location, not the party hostel i was expecting though. we stayed on a friday and there was the limo party to los angeles however this was around $55 and had limited people signed upto it, there didn't seem to be much else going on at the hostel. for a friday night i expected more communal drinking and maybe a local bar crawl.  venice beach however had great atmosphere and this hostel is perfectly located for that."

USA,Male,18-24,6.3,8,6,10,6,2,6,6,"nicely located hostel, right by venice beach. positives include being right beside the boardwalk and beach, events were nicely organized and enjoyable, and some of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.  negatives include the lack of functional ac in our room (it was sweltering our first day), the small locker size (not big enough for a well packed backpack) and some of the staff were absolutely awful. no reason to hassle us when we carried 1 of 2 sets of keys and were in the same room!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"first time in a hostel. great experience. staff was awesome, location was great. safe, and clean. free breakfast! many travellers from overseas, which is awesome!"

USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"by far the best hostel i&amp;#39;ve been too. the staff very warm and welcoming, the breakfast very good, location primetime, i can go on and on. can&amp;#39;t wait to return."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,i would definitely tell others that want to visit la about this hostel. the staff are very helpful and understanding. if you were going to stay at samesum definitely take advantage of the night activities especially happy hour with the ledge dom ( i think he said he&amp;#39;s name was)

"
Germany,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"its a great hostel, right in venice with some epic staff and great daily activities. its always clean and you have your own charging station on each bed (thats always a plus). the breakfast is one the best ones ive had in us hostels so i def like it there. the only downside is the bathroom issue. i know some of the rooms had an ensuite but many didnt and two bathrooms per floor with that many people...you always end up standing in line or do what i did: get up super early instead."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely chuffed with this place. they provided activities, strong wifi 📶, friendly, let me put my bag in storage. right on door step to skate park. bathroom, room spotless. cannot fault one bit, hands down the best hostel i have been in. "
England,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,4,8,4,10,"the location was great - just a few steps from the beach. the room was nice, well equipped with plugs, shelf &amp; individual reading lights. the bathroom was also good with a decent shower. the free breakfast was fairly decent as well. the hostel wasn't very social though as there was nothing to do in the common room &amp; not even the tv was usable. the taco tuesday night out could have been made more exciting too- the group got a bit bored and wanted to change to a bar. reception staff were helpful."
Israel,Female,18-24,9.1,6,8,10,10,10,10,10,good location

Croatia,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"super friendly and helpful staff, best location in venice beach, right at the beach and skate park. activities every night and very friendly atmosphere all around."

Switzerland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a fun time at this hostel. its super close to the beach and the staff was really friendly. also free beer and drinks its a little expensive but you will have a lot of fun there
Turkey,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"hostel is in a great location if you want to be in venice. it is located as close to the main entrance to venice as possible. but venice at night can get sketchy. just be forewarned. once you pass through the door, you are fine. but be open to meeting and seeing sketchy folk outside at night. tho being very central, there is almost always a cop car on the street there. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"location was amazing, staff was nice, there was an event planned each night so it was easy to meet the other guests and hang out, cleanliness was pretty standard for a hostel."
Morocco,Male,31-40,8,6,10,10,6,10,4,10,"it is in the beach! clean, freindly and helpful staff. ok free breakfast. almost no atmosphere though for solo travellers due to a tiny common area.   but if i am going back the the beach, this hostel is the one!"
Belgium,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,10,8,6,nice hostel in a cool location in venice. was clean although the rooms weren&amp;#39;t too well ventilated so it smelled a bit stuffy but i was only there for a night. staff were very friendly and helpful and the place felt safe and secure. there&amp;#39;s a common room to hang out and meet other people and the beach is literally a few steps away.
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"very nice facilities, clean and friendly. there just wasn&amp;#39;t much table space for breakfast and it could be quite noisy at night but other than that great hostel, lots going on!"
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,it is very near venice beach. you can see the veach in room. samesun is very cool.
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel in a great spot, right in the heart of venice. staff were great, refunded me a couple nights as i changed plans. clean and free breakfast in the morning. little bit pricey but it is the us after all! "

England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the location of this hostel is great, right on the heart of venice beach, you literally walk out and you're on the boardwalk - so helpful!   the rooms are good, a little cramped, not ideal for large suitcases but great for travellers backpacks. the beds are very comfortable, which is always a bonus!  the free breakfast is great, choose from oats, toast, pancakes &amp; fresh fruit - if you're travelling on a budget, this helps a lot, be sure to load up..   overall this hostel is very good! "
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"staff is friendly and very helpful. overall the place was kept clean everyday, free breakfast was decent. the locations is a bit sketchy after dark, but they do have security watching the facilities at night. only complaint is that venice beach can get loud and crazy, but that doesn&amp;#39;t really have to do with the hostel. great location for partiers and beach bums."
Canada,Couple,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"after staying at a samesun in kelowna and having a good experience, i thought i&amp;#39;d give their venice location a try.  my wife and i rented a private room for four nights.  we had a few hiccups: the smoke-detector kept beeping and we were initially over-charged (deposit wasn&amp;#39;t factored in).  but as soon as we pointed out the problems, they were fixed.  the staff is very friendly and helpful, and you can&amp;#39;t beat the location.  i&amp;#39;d stay again and would recommend to others.  "
SaudiArabia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,it was a great experience i wish to repeated again 🙃👍🏻
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"this was quite honestly one of the best hostels i&amp;#39;ve ever stayed in! the location was amazing, right on venice boardwalk and close to cafes, shops etc. my room (a private double), was really cosy, comfortable and clean, and i had the best night&amp;#39;s sleep of my trip there! the shared bathrooms were also spacious, and acceptably clean, which was a nice change from previous hostels. the breakfast was also a win - a diy affair inclusive of a pancake and egg station! wifi worked well. "
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"the staff were very friendly and accommodating, the rooms were basic but clean with adequate locker space. the kitchen facilities were clean and well maintained. the lounge area was small but comfortable and had a lovely view.    there aren&amp;#39;t many convenience stores local to the hostel, but a short walk and you can fond what you need.  the overall vibe of the hostel was chilled and inviting, they offer something to do every day and really give you the full backpacker experience! "
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,4,10,10,2,10,6,4,great location but extremely noisy. bathroom far from being clean and tiny rooms for the price.  
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i only stayed one night but it was a great hostel! i showed up way earlier than check in after a 13 hour flight from sydney and the handsome guy at the reception that morning let me know where to eat, shower, and store my luggage. he also had the room ready for me as quick as he could and i realllyyyyy appreciated that after a long flight. even upgraded me! clean place right on venice beach, easy to meet people too. the whole 24 hours was so great. "
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"had a great stay at samesun. especially liked the cleanliness of the showers, the organization of daily activities (most were free) and the breakfast. location is great,  right at the beach. "

NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.1,4,6,10,6,10,8,6,great location and fun hostel
Ireland,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"probably the best hostel i have stayed in, was super spotless, the beds were comfy, location was great, free breakfast and security was good. i stayed in a 7 bed dorm and my bed had its own light, outlet to charge my phone at night and it was comfy!! the location is great and you are right on the artsy venice beach, the only downside is if you want to visit places like the walk of fame etc you&amp;#39;re not close to it. la is expensive to travel around so i got a bus ticket for the hop on hop off bus"
Guam,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,great place! will stay again.
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel, has it all - perfect location, great atmosphere, facilities and most of all excellent staff, always willing to help and great chat. we had the best stay here. there is always activities on offer and staff are good at recommending where to go. overall the best hostel we have stayed at. would most definitely recommend to stay here.

Germany,Female,18-24,6,6,6,10,4,8,4,4,"wir hatten ein dunkler zimmer, welches nicht unbedingt sehr toll eingerichtet war.   die mitarbeiter an der rezeption waren sehr freundlich, aber es war schon etwas dreckig und das frühstück eher etwas mager.   location - es ist sehr nah am beach ... aber achtung ! - auch etwas in ""ghetto""   "
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"i enjoyed my stay here.     the main thing going for the hostel is its location being right off the boardwalk. this does mean that it can be quite noisy at all times, but that&amp;#39;s something you have to deal with if you want to be right there in it. despite the noise i had no trouble sleeping.    another big positive is the free breakfast which includes bread, toast, fruit and pancakes with coffee, tea and orange juice.     i enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to other travellers."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had such an epic time. massive thanks to dominic for creating a great atmosphere and getting everyone together. also thanks to sebastian for looking out for everyone. would definitely come back here 
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, just off the venice boardwalk. staff are friendly and there are planned events every night - the twilight concert series was particularly enjoyable. breakfast includes pancakes, toast, jam and marmalade, orange slices and eggs, with coffee, tea and orange juice. the wifi was pretty fast in the dorm room. great experience, would stay again!  "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i love this hostel!! i&amp;#39;ve been backpacking the last 2 months and they have the most comfy mattresses! dorm was great, good size with individual shelves and power points. breakfast was great, lots of options. they had a lot of activities on every night too. plus its in the best location. taxi from lax was $25 and is only 20 minutes away. i highly recommend "
Austria,Female,25-30,8,6,10,10,8,4,8,10,"nice hostel, but unfortunatley me and my friend were put in two seperate rooms, tough we&amp;#39;ve booked long before"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel. the location alone makes this the hostel to stay at, you really couldn&amp;#39;t get any closer to the beach! the staff were friendly and helpful and most nights the hostel has something going on. we went to the karaoke night and had a wicked time. the room was clean, secure and had its own bathroom which was a bonus. would definitely recommend this hostel to anyone and i&amp;#39;m already looking at going back! "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great spot, cool staff and always have things organised to do. would stay again."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,premium location. very secure.  helpful staff. would definitely stay again.  pretty expensive for a hostel but that&amp;#39;s probably due to their location so it&amp;#39;s worth it.
Scotland,Female,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,a fantastic place to stay with great friendly staff and an awesome location. i will definitely be back.   ali
Sweden,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,6,10,"crowded, not much space, neither in rooms nor in common area."
India,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,excellent location. right by the side of the beach. overall a nice stay.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,10,8,6,8,"didn't have the best atmosphere while i was there. location is amazing, facilities like wifi, access to powerpoints etc were really good. bathroom was okay, there was no aircon in the room just fans and it got pretty stuffy and didn't smell too great at times. free breakfast was also pretty good. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, friendly people.  there are only a few bathrooms for all of the shared dorms (at least on the second floor) so pretty hard to get a shower in or even just use the bathroom.  other than that, really great facilities."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed staying at samesun.  roommates were lovely. place was clean. shower facilities were good too.  staff were very helpful and friendly.   on thursday night (7/7/2016), the organizer for the night activity, dominic was awesome!  he went above and beyond his job. he took us out in the group to santa monica pier, where we watched the twilight series and had some bevies. he was heaps chilled and cool. definitely sad to leave venice from this experience."
Canada,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,good spot.  simple.  worth the money given the location.  breakfast was good as well.  they do a good job of logging ins and outs at nighttime which keeps the sketchies at bay.  
Germany,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"when i came to the hostel i had just escaped a different one in l.a that was not very nice and i was really happy to finely meet friendly people, be in a kind atmosphere and finely being able to sleep - i was so greatful about that! generally great beds :), very comfortable. and as i said, very nice and friendly atmosphere, both created by staff and other travelers. great view from the dining/hang out room, nice breakfast, felt more like being a guest at a friends place. enjoyed it very much!"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,the hostel is amazing. it&amp;#39;s location is very central right next to the beach and you get a great view. everyone is super friendly and they have a great way to make people connect! i&amp;#39;m definitely coming back. 
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,4,6,6,4,"this is a mediocre hostel. it lacks simple things that make all the difference—a place to hang your towel in the shared bathroom; a shelf in the shower to rest your soap. some staff was friendly and helpful; others less so. breakfast is ok. common area is ok, too. put simply: if you love great hostels, you may not love it here. the redeeming quality is easy beach access. "
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"can&amp;#39;t recommend this place enough.    brilliant in every area the staff, location, clean, evening activities and the type of person this place attracts are what makes samesun venice beach backpackers wicked."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"really awesome staff, welcoming and friendly. great location as well with venice beach just outside the door. place was really secured. always locked front door with id checking every time you enter. do recommend highly if you&amp;#39;re looking to stay in this area."

Canada,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay! the staff are all amazing! very pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable about area and activities, easy going, yet professional. i felt very comfortable and safe here. during this stay my partner and myself stayed in a private room overlooking venice beach. comfortable bed, clean room and bathroom and equipped with fridge, tv, and free wifi.  if you are looking to experience venice beach, this is the place to stay! great for solo travellers, couples, etc. did i mention complimentary breaky"
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,8,6,10,10,10,the desk staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. the other guests were good hostel mates. the place was clean and staff were always on hand to keep the place in order. the breakfast was good as well. the bathroom could use some hooks or shelves for putting things when showering. the back of the toilet is the only  surface and this is problematic with no toilet seat to catch anything that might fall. the location is close to the beach though also right in the heart of the funky street life. 
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,nice staffs :) and awesome location!!   definitely stay again! thanks a lot❤️

England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the entire place was fantastic. can&amp;#39;t speak highly enough of e staff. especially abby and sebastien. great people and really went above and beyond to help us whilst we were there. we will be back i can promise you that!!! #veniceisthebest
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location!!  breakfast was super good (toast,pancakes,eggs fruit,oatmeal and much more)  all staff were super helpful and going out of the way to make sure you were enjoying your stay, i would highly recommend this hostel. thank you abby and sara for a great stay!!"
Canada,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"only stayed a night, had a good breakfast and wifi was good, great location on the beach if your looking for a party area this is great a little loud at night but expected !"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic location and great faculties, cannot rave about the staff enough! the lovely sam was helpful on the phone before i arrived and helped me check in. kevin was super friendly and helpful (although he's not as good at mario kart as he will claim to be!) ryder was lots of fun taking us on a bike ride and most importantly to happy hour. and finally dom ran thirsty thursday's which was an awesome way to meet other backpackers! my free upgrade to an ocean view ensuite 7 bed room was a bonus! "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, great staff, great view, everything is just great about samesun. "
Mexico,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"i would say the hostel is pretty much allright for youth and backpackers travelling alone for a couple of days, and it is quite nicely located. the noise of the fans might be too much for some people at night and the views are not romantic but its a clean, safe, on-the-limits-of-decency hostel worth the price for l.a."
England,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the  location for this hostel is perfect, literally next to the board walk of venice beach. takes 2 mins to walk skate park and an extra minute to the sea. staff were all really friendly and helpful, they let me keep my stuff at the hostel all day after i checked out and let me use the facilities. it&amp;#39;s pricey but you&amp;#39;re on venice beach. definitely recommend "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent staff ... adrian and sam were very informative and friendly..  giving a warm welcoming atmosphere from the moment of check-in until my departure.  samesun  venice beach is a 5 star hostel in my opinion, offering a clean, comfortable stay at a great location ...and at an affordable price.  i booked a private room and couldn&amp;#39;t have been happier with my stay.  i look forward to going back next time i am in town!!  thank you samesun staff!"
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,perfect location right on the beach! 
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great location good wifi and helpful staff. especially the guy who runs the activities dom, showed us a great night out knows all the good things to do in venice. legend. showers are good to here and they didn't charge us on a night we had to cancel "
Sweden,Couple,25-30,8,6,8,10,10,8,6,8,"nice hostel literally 10 steps away from venice beach. a lot of partying, which is great if you fancy the ""college/spring break"" vibe, you'll find a lot of americans in their early 20's.  we enjoyed the generous breakfast and  a great kitchen, combined with an excellent location in l.a. staff was helpful and always talkative. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,everything was perfect. the hostel is really close to the beach.
Canada,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, staff was very friendly, breakfast was very good! we had a 4 bunk room with a view of the ocean  ! "
England,Female,31-40,4,2,4,10,4,2,2,4,"not a great experience - had an altercation with a staff member &amp; she handled it appallingly. they actually started arguing amongst themselves about it too, making me feel worse.  really scruffy hostel - totally in need of renovating. coming from the hi hostel in san francisco to here was like leaving claridges &amp; going to a trailer park.  the basic you expect in a hostel is a room with a lock &amp; even semi-pleasant staff - neither is here.  ridiculously bad value.  poky little common room. avoid."
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,great place in a great location with great people. i would stay there again :).
Chile,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"very nice located, well equipped, maybe the kitchen is a little small. "
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"enjoyed my stay. great location, right on the beach boardwalk. free breakfast was also nice. would definitely stay here again."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.9,8,6,8,10,10,10,10,"only stayed one night but it was enough to tell it is a good place in the overall.     nice and clean bathrooms. good facilities in general. good breakfast.     we went to have tacos as part of that night&amp;#39;s event organized by the hostel. the guy in charge (dominique i think) was really nice.     the area where it&amp;#39;s located does not feel so secure, specially at night. "
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,great hostel amazing location and lots of fun free activities which was great to meet people. book the seven person room - beach and ocean views. bit on the pricey side but wouldn&amp;#39;t stay anywhere else. parking in venice is a nightmare though
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"staff and facilities were good. well placed location is cheap to get an uber anywhere around la, short walk to santa monica. plenty of food around the area.  only complaint was that there was some funky smells coming through the air vents"
Colombia,Couple,25-30,6.6,8,2,6,6,8,8,8,"nice common areas. we didn&amp;#39;t expect to have a private bathroom, so that was nice. clean facilities. staff is very nice. cool atmosphere.   if you&amp;#39;re only going to visit venice beach and santa monica it is a very nice location. the street is full of homeless people so it gets really sketchy specially at night. "
Slovenia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great staff, nice location and the best event maneger (you are awesome dom)."
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,4.3,2,2,10,2,10,2,2,i booked ahead of time. i called before i checked in and talked to the front desk. great guy. awesome service. however before you book bring your passport!!!!! they only take passports!!!! guy was helpful and understanding about my situation. i got lucky. not everyone is lucky. 
Belgium,AllMaleGroup,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,4,8,8,8,"excellent location as venice beach is one of the nicer spots of la.  nice common area, en breakfast is alright (pancakes, toast with jam, orange slices and coffee, milk, orange juice, tea)  improvements:   - very few toilets and showers on each floor which makes you wait a lot of times.  - in our room there was a small window leading to an inside corridor, hence impossible to get fresh air inside the room, and very hot at night!  some other rooms, however, have a nice view on the beach! "
Germany,Female,25-30,8,10,8,10,8,4,8,8,"amazing location and room was pretty good. comfortable bed. like the fact that they already do the sheets for you.   staff was pretty rude / didn&amp;#39;t feel very welcome. guy at the night shift seemed pretty stoned, too. not what i expected.     however overall i would recommend the place because of the good location to venice and good rooms for a hostel.  "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect loaction for the best venice beach experience! great staff! nightly activities are lots of fun. cant wait to go back
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"hands down the cleanest hostel ive ever stayed in 10 years!! the common shower stall has a glass door instead of curtain, rather modern for a hostel. stayed in a room of 4 and paid pretty much the same as the 8-occupant counterpart in the hi in santa monica.     only complaint is that the luggage storage is completely open to all. it does gives easy access to retrieve your stuff during the day before/after check out. but dont keep anything valuable in there!     not an extremely social hostel. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,"staff were great.  affordable and private room was pretty good.  when we first arrived there was someone&amp;#39;s fake nail on the floor (bit gross) and one pillow case had two stains on both sides (also really gross). staff changed for us happily though.   no elevator made the trip up the stairs with heavy bags very difficult and almost unbearable. surprising there was no elevator!  overall if the cleanliness was a bit better, it would&amp;#39;ve been the perfect pitstop in venice. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"adrian, kevin, and dom were very welcoming and friendly. it&amp;#39;s in a great location and you really can&amp;#39;t beat it for the money."
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,"really cool hostel right in venice - prob the best location in la. can&amp;#39;t honestly think why anyone would want to stay in west hollywood or similar. this place is super funky, very chill, with some excellent people, good social vibe and great staff. easy to meet people and close to a lot of very cool bars and restaurants. and venice itself is one of the most incredible patchworks of weirdness you will ever visit. definitely recommended."
Scotland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great team - super welcoming and really good fun. adrienne was full of suggestions on things to do and where to find things, would definitely stay here again. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"was only here for the night, however the staff were great and the atmosphere was cool. easy to get along and talk with people. there&amp;#39;s also a nice organic mexican place around the corner, this really made a difference after eating all the processed american food."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.4,4,8,10,2,4,4,6,"on the whole not a terrible hostel however there were not nearly enough bathrooms for the amount of people, rooms were hot and sticky and fans did not work and staff were indifferent.     perfect location by venice beach, really the only selling point. "
USA,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"what a scam. i booked a spot, and tried to check in after midnight. tired and exhausted after a long day. the staff tell me that i cannot check in with ca id, need passport. the first time i have ever found a place in the united states that did not accept state id card as a valid document for checking in. my booking fee of $5 was stolen from me. i spent 2 hours looking for another place to stay, and ended up paying $200 more for a room and another $50 on uber. in middle of the night.... "
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,8,8,10,4,6,4,4,rooms are not cleaned often enough. i checked in on friday and my room was trashed with clothes and towels not belonging to anyone in the room and the trash was overflowing. i chose not to stay the night in the room but left my stuff in the locker provided in the room for security. was only offered a refund for last night. property needs some upgrades and more sympathetic staff. 
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,"place is centrally located to venice. only two bathrooms/shower on each floor, which meant at times you were waiting in the hallway to use it. staff were great, i arrived at 7am was able to have brekkie and store luggage. however the luggage room wasn't very secure as they was no room, anyone could go in/out. music played from the place below the whole night  and even when i woke up in the morning so wasn't exactly peaceful nights sleep. place could do with a little tlc. "
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,10,10,6,2,6,6,the girl was extremely rude when we first arrived. i also paid to have laundry done and they gave the bag back to me the next day and the clothes had not been washed. i didn&amp;#39;t realise until i left the hostel so i emailed them twice about it and they still haven&amp;#39;t gotten back to me. 
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel ! right on venice beach! staff very friendly and helpful! can&amp;#39;t reccomend more :))
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i&amp;#39;m easy to please but everything was still super great. the wifi was good enough to stream a live nhl hockey game from my bed. breakfast was really great. i thought i would feel a little more sketchy coming back late at night because of some reviews but it was completely fine. the staff were super tolerant, relaxed, informative and helpful. it was $100 uber to the staples center and 10 steps from the beach. bike rentals next door for 6/hr. beer,groceries,toiletries,fruits,veg all a block or two"
USA,Female,31-40,6.6,10,6,10,6,4,6,4,the staff was not the friendliest... and though the location was great.. the cleanliness was not the best... though its 1k times better than the others in the area. 
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,"its all good when looking for basic needs. really well located by the beach. worth staying, i could be back there, good breakfast. no more than the basic needs. "
Australia,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,absolutely loved it. so affordable &amp; in the best spot. i highly recommend it. if we ever go back to venice beach la we will defiantly stay @samesun again... 🌴😀
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean, great breakfast with eggs pancakes toast juice coffee and oranges, very very helpful staff (thank you guys so much), foster a very inclusive environment, daily group activities, right by the beach in the coolest area with an amazing sunset"

Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,10,10,6,8,8,8,had a radical time! 
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i had an amazing time here. the place was clean and really secure, they only let you in if you have a reservation. i could go on about the building and amenities, but here&amp;#39;s the short and sweet: the staff are amazing. they are very eager to help you with what they can and it is apparent that they love working here. they have planned events every night that change week to week. this is easily one of the best hostels i&amp;#39;ve been to in the us. next time i&amp;#39;m in la i&amp;#39;m stopping by just to see the s"
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,6,8,was a hostel in a great location. staff could have been more welcoming/host like?
Mexico,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay. right by the beach, lots of local restaurants and bars to hang around.   the place is clean, comfortable, the ppl that work there really friendly.   no bad comments for this place, i&amp;#39;ll for sure stay there in the future. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,very nice and right on the beach with an excellent view from the common room window :) 
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,4,8,8,8,8,"venice beach is awesome by day, scary by night. a lot of homeless and addicts roaming the streets. however, the hostel is centrally located and it is so nice to be so close to the beach. i&amp;#39;d reccomend santa monica over venice any day. staff was friendly besides the rude security guard. free breakfast included coffee, orange juice, toast, pancakes, fruit, etc. the rooms were clean and nice enough but very crammed with six beds in a room made for 2-3. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing atmosphere and the location is incredible!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location, right on the beach. the staff are wonderful and incredibly accommodating. i originally booked one night but stayed for three and they were very helpful in changing my room so i could stay with some friends who arrived the next day. they make a real effort to bring everyone together with nightly activities and you can see the beach through the common room window and even some of the dorm rooms. wouldn't hesitate in staying here again. thanks team!"
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this hostel was so cool, in a great location next to the beach, the staff are helpful and friendly. it&amp;#39;s a small hostel and you meet some awesome people, the breakfast is good. i would come back here "
Spain,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the hostel is really nice and in a perfect location. the room was big enough and clean. they have an excellent housekeeping team. the australian guy at the front desk and the new boy at the desk were really nice and helpful. abby and dominic were awesome. i can&amp;#39;t wait to come back again! thanks samesun team!
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,8,10,"good location for just a few days, decent breakfast, friendly staff. "
England,Female,25-30,3.7,2,6,2,4,6,4,2,"the room seemed vaguely clean but smelt dirty as did the bedding, my pillow smelt so much i ended up using my clothes instead the first night. the staff were friendly but all of the staff i met were male and to be honest i felt a little leched upon.     there was maintenance work going on constantly which meant bathrooms would be constantly out of order and the was noise and mess.    the area is ok if you are looking for overpriced tourist stall and weed but if not i would not recommend it. "
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great experience!! the breakfast is great, and you can&amp;#39;t beat the location. also, we did the limo party on friday night (signed up at front desk) and it was so much fun! the only negative is the neighborhood is a little sketchy after sunset but nothing to scary. would absolutely recommend!!"
Poland,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,6,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay if u like ocean and surfing. but far away to other tourist attractions.   pleasant atmosphere, different activities organised by the hostel every day, friendly staff.     "
Wales,Male,18-24,7.4,6,10,10,4,8,6,8,great location but kind of lacking in facilities (very small common area and kitchen) and the beds were uncomfortable.    breakfast was good and the staff were friendly and helpful.
Japan,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"there&amp;#39;s only two bathroom for each floor(2 floors) and 1 of them were not working, and the a/c was not good as well,  so i put 3 in facilities. otherwise it was perfect!"
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff at this hostel are wonderful. i miss them! the beds are very comfy. the only thing that bothered me was that there is no barrier on the top bunk to stop me rolling off in the night so i didn&amp;#39;t sleep to well for fear of falling! 
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is great, truly. it&amp;#39;s everything a hostel is meant to be. the common rooms are always packed with people with the vibe to socialize and hang. the staff are pretty cool and as helpful as you need them to be. facilities are clean, lots of storage room, free wifi &amp; breakfast. you wake up on venice beach. plenty of street parking near by. it&amp;#39;s a great hostel!     "
Canada,Female,31-40,7.1,10,6,10,6,8,6,4,it is right in front of beach but it doea not seem safe around the building.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,awesome location right on venice beach. some of the staff were really helpful and fun. had some issues with the key not opening the room door and also they didn't have any laundry facilities but otherwise really good facilities. the most comfortable beds i've had in a hostel.
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,"great location and the rooms were okay but nothing amazing. bunk beds and basic sheets. right next to the boardwalk which is great for going out, but it's also an area where a lot of homeless people constantly wonder about. make sure to bring your passport (even if you're american which surprised me,) or they may not let you in. the staff was friendly enough but nothing memorable."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,"no hidden fees. top location obviously. good breakfast, good staff. not the cleanest i&amp;#39;ve seen but it&amp;#39;s alright. for the price, can&amp;#39;t ask better. my mattress was shot though... good hostel overall!"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,great location right on venice beach with views out over the skate park.
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,great hostel in great location! waking up right in the middle of everything really helps while traveling!
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,6,6,"while most of the staff were wonderful and helpful, a few appeared rather rude and inconvenienced by me. over all a good hostel, the rooms were clean and relatively spacious - they are under going renovations which means cramped spaces available to relax and noise at different hours of the day. i would recommend it for the location but perhaps leave it for a few months until the renovations are over."
Finland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everyone was so great and nice and helpful at samesun!! nick and bethany and this one guy, cant remember his name, but you all were great. location was the best, right at the beach, and there is so much to do with people from the hostel. you wont be alone here."
Germany,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,perfect location right off the boardwalk.  basic but good free breakfast (better than some i had in american hotels...)  mindful staff regarding cleanliness and breakfast supply. ;-)  renovation is going on - not a problem during my stay.  wifi was down.  i enjoyed my stay. thank you all!
Germany,Male,41+,6.3,4,8,10,4,6,6,6,"- wifi was announced to be down just for that day, obviously it has been down for quite a while w/o any effort from the staff to change that situation.  - free breakfast - but no coffee. heeee? excuse ""the coffee machine broke down, but there is a shop to"
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,4,8,8,8,it was a decent hostel however the wifi was down and there was maintenance going on.
USA,Couple,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,6,8,this was a great hostel right in the heart of venice beach. you're literally steps away from the boardwalk- perfect location. the common areas are sort of lacking but they do put on a lot of events for guests. definitely recommend!
Italy,Male,18-24,6.6,8,6,10,6,4,4,8,"the position is perfect, right on the beach.. the room was ok, unfortunately was extremely cold during the night. i also had my first shower during the morning and the water wasn't hot at all, while seems having in the evening it comes hot.."
Australia,Male,25-30,4.9,4,4,8,4,4,4,6,"average hostel especially at the price, only redeeming feature is the proximity to the beach"
USA,Male,41+,6.9,4,8,10,4,8,8,6,"i was rather disappointed. the first problem they really need to fix is their wi-fi sucks really bad, worse than most places i stayed in south america recently. i stayed here 4 days and it was almost useless the whole time, could barely even check messages or facebook, etc. so they really need to fix that and upgrade. the other problem was the hot water. i took three showers and every time i had lukewarm water. also the mattress i had was pretty lumpy. great location though, &amp; good breakfast."
Mexico,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,10,6,8,"the hostel was very good. right next to venice beach, literally a 2 minute walk to the ocean. i wish it was a little more lively but then again i was there on a tuesday night so that could explain it."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a wonderful time! it was great waking up to the sunrise with the surfers bobbing in the shore waiting for the waves (which averaged six feet high and sometimes tubed). the best part of my stay was the staff here; they are helpful knowledgeable, friendly, and really cared about my stay. they seem to be a mixture of venice locals and foreign nationals. clean room, great facilities, great vibe overall. i look forward to coming back soon. highly highly recommended."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"good hostel. the showers only had cool water, so i wouldn't recommend a long stay during the cold months for that reason. although sufficed for my 2 night stay. nice staff and really good breakfast! bedding was also really comfortable."
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a great stay at samesun venice beach, again. it was my first time staying at this hostel and that's for a good reason. first of all the location is perfect! right on the boardwalk , the famous venice skate park is only 1 minute walking and the neighbourhood is lively and entertaining!   what i love most about staying at samesun is the amazing staff! everyone has been so friendly and helpful. me and my friends went on a few activities with dom and nick and had a great time."
Australia,Female,18-24,4.9,6,6,6,2,4,2,8,"after staying in their vancouver location, i had expectations for this place - it did not live up. the staff were okay, nothing to rave about. there was no laundry. most annoying of all was the lock on one of the bathrooms didn't work and i got walked in on twice while i the shower and i saw it happen to others. also would've been nice if there was some surface to pit your stuff on in there. location is good if you wanna get to the airport or venice boardwalk, but everything else is super far."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,10,8,great for people travelling with the intent of meeting people.

Australia,Couple,18-24,9.1,6,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the staff were great! friendly, approachable! right in the heart of venice beach and a bike ride away from santa monica, if that's what you want to do. two buses from the airport and a short walk to the hostel. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,6,8,10,10,6,"great hostel, within walking distance to the beach. the hostel itself might feel a little cramped, especially when everyone is trying to use the kitchen all at once. the area this hostel is located on is not the best, especially at night. but very friendly staff, and good atmosphere."
Norway,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"had a great stay at this hostel, in the absolute center of venice beach. the wi-fi is not good at all, but maybe that's a good thing? you have to actually talk to people face to face! the staff is helpful, and the check-in went pretty fast. clean and nice room - definitely a place i would recommend to other people. "
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"personally, my stay here was fantastic. the staff were friendly and kind, the hostel was really clean, the people i met there were lovely, and the free breakfast was phenomenal. what a spread! fresh fruit, pancakes, eggs, cinnamon raisin toast.. and most importantly heaps of free coffee and juice to jump-start your day. 10/10.. if i'm ever in need of a hostel in socal again, i'll definitely be back."

USA,Couple,25-30,4.9,2,8,8,4,6,4,2,"overpriced &amp; dirty, one of the worst hostels i've been too. no idea how it has such a high rating. stains on the carpet, white splotches on the headboard of the bed, strange smell, brown stains on the ceiling fan, short &amp; uncomfortable bed, dusty...not a comfortable place to stay. too make it worse, many of the rooms, including ours, had no window too the outside, only to a tiny indoor roofed courtyard (a few m2 in diameter). few pros: location, decent breakfast, nice manager. go somewhere else."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"just thought the pink purple hair chick was a bit rude but other than that (&amp; the awful bed i was sleeping on) the hostel is unreal. dominic is awesome, breakfast is pretty sweet, location is absolute mint - right on the beach. jays surf shop next door pretty much made me fall in love with a cali boy, dopest guy ever &amp; super cheap rentals. i'll be back for sure!"

Poland,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i had a great stay, wish it could be longer! i definitelly recommend this hostel over the samesun in hollywood - better breakfast, better facilities. venice beach is beautiful and the hostel is almost right next to the broadwalk. i stayed in mixed dorm with private batroom and it was good and clean."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"enjoyed my stay at samesun venice, had a private double room. fridge and tv in the room with our own sink was a bonus. all the staff were helpful and friendly, only disappointing part was during peak times the showers tended to be cold. besides that would definitely recommend this hostel as it has a friendly vibe and great location!"
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,6,10,6,8,8,8,"great location, right on the beach, near a few bars. facilities are good and kept clean, however it is a mile or so from the nearest laundry with no washing machines on site. staff are friendly and answer questions when asked. veinice hasn't got loads to do. so either rent a bike or find out about bus routes to see things."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,seriously loved the pancake breakfast!!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"the staff were always so helpful and all the other guests were lovely. the kitchen is always clean as were the bathrooms. the bedding was very clean and i genuinely felt very safe in the hotel. it's a great location if you want to be close to the beach and santa monica, it's a bit of a bus ride to hollywood but doable. it is however quite a distance from disney. asides from that i loved it."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,absolutely fantastic location at a great price. would definitely stay again. note that even if you are a us citizen you need to have a passport with you at check-in.

Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"loved this hostel! so close to the beach, you can see it from the common room. staff were really helpful, there's activities each day and suggestions on what to do around venice/la. really easy to meet people. would recommend booking room with ensuite, otherwise there's only a couple of bathrooms on each floor. would definitely stay here again! "
SouthAfrica,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,"the wifi is very poor. rooms could do with better cleaning, someone had stuck gum on the shelf beside the lamp in the top bunk that i was occupying , it had not been removed by the cleaning staff . windows were also filthy."

Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,better hot water and pressure in the showers would have been good.  could never get a hot one no matter what time of day or night i took one.
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"second stay here. in september the heat was insane and the lack of air con was a kick in the nuts. however, en-suite shower was alright, room was clean... it's a great place to stay. perfect location. everything you could  want  is in the area. good hostel!"
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.4,6,10,8,6,8,6,8,"staff we helpful and friendly. stayed in a 4 bed dorm and was quite comfortable. had our own bathroom. lockers in dorm also and storage for bags if you check in early. literally on venice beach boardwalk so you walk straight out onto the strip. about 40 mins to hollywood via taxi or uber but not much you can do. kitchen was not too bad and breakfast provided was pretty decent: eggs, fruit, coffee and pancakes pretty good. most certainly worth staying if you in town for a few days. peace from aus"
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,it was good choice for me

Germany,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,well located hostel. nice staff. nice breakfast. rooms are alright. on the 2nd floor it might be a little noisy due to a bar that is located below. very recomandable hostel!
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"best location ever, right in front  of the main beach in venice. clean facilities. great atmosphere with the right activities for the place (tuesday tacos and live music bar). for a quick trip to la this hostel is the best."
Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"the staff was cool and fun , they would try and bring you out nightly and would provide you with transportation. the hostle was pretty secure and had a 24 hour watch . also maintained pretty well , and they would give you a reall breakfast . this hostel was really good 👍🏻"
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,courtney was great with helping us sort everything out!

USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"all staff members were extremely helpful right from check-in and leading activities to hanging around and checking out. they all made effort to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves.   showers were nice and hot, breakfast has plenty of options (ie. eggs, fruit, pancakes, toast, coffee, tea), security was the best i've seen at a hostel by far!    the only con i would say is the shelves above each bed could definitely use a sweep. aside from that, the place is pretty clean."
Portugal,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"had an amazing time at this hostel. great people and staff, specially ""los ninjas"" (i hope i got it right). i definitely recommend you to stay there :)"
Portugal,Male,25-30,8,4,10,6,6,10,10,10,"stayed almost 2 weeks in this hostel and while i loved some aspects, i've also had a hard time in room 308. noise levels coming from the window that shakes all night for some odd reason just made my nights miserable. my bed was also shaking a lot for some unknown reason and the wifi speed and endless times i had to refresh my login added up to the bad aspects. these two were the most problematic experiences i had."
USA,AllMaleGroup,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"one of the best hostel experience i've ever had. apart from given location and facilities, the atmosphere that staff created was amazing. special thanks to bethany for looking after us and denise for organizing a halloween party of the century!"

USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was so much fun and made my trip to california so memorable!! the staff was super friendly and gave me great recommendations. i'll definitely be returning to samesun venice, thank you!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,location was perfect and the free pancake breakfast was a huge bonus.
Australia,Female,18-24,2.9,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is in a really bad area. i didn't feel safe walking outside the hostel. there idea of a ""fully equip kitchen"" had a kettle that was full of rust,. one quest fridge which was always full due to the lack of storage it provided. the hostels ""free breakfast"" consisted of rotten eggs, stale bread. hostel smelt bad, reception were lazy and unfriendly, hostel was also dirty and hot. shower head full of rust."
Finland,Couple,25-30,6.3,6,8,10,2,8,6,4,"there's no air conditioning in the rooms, so even in the end of october it was burning hot at the daytime and in the nights it was even hard to breathe because of the hotness. also there's only two showers for the entire floor so get up early! by the end of the day the shower/bathroom floor is all wet and sandy and nasty. the whole place has a very unpleasant smell. however, breakfast is good, staff is friendly and the location is perfect if you want to hang out at the beach."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,i have been here for 3 days   staffs are really great and kind
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,clean. great location. friendly staff.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,10,4,8,8,8,"great location, breakfast is yummy, staff are really nice and helpful, and everything was clean. luckily had nice roomies too. everything was good except one thing. no one could sleep as the rooms were too hot. they provided two fans (one on your bed and one for the room), however these were not enough for la in october. hostel really needs air conditioning or more fans."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,6,8,10,6,10,10,6,"great atmosphere, awsome people, amazing location, but ridiculously hot!"
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"can't beat the location, right on the beach front, but hottest place on earth. the fans in the room didn't touch it. difficult to sleep whilst slowly cooking. "
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,4,8,6,2,"the staff members are nice, friendly and helpful. all in all it is a good place for young people to stay close to the beach. the bad thing was that our room was very hot and muggy. it was sure very difficult to sleep in it. also our bathroom was very dirty. we found different hair from all the other people who lived in this room before."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,great hostel with a great location and social atmosphere. everything was clean and the beds comfortable.  i was there during a heat wave and the room was suffocatingly hot so you have been warned in hot conditions be prepared to sweat!
England,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,2,10,8,6,"great location and good staff! the rooms were clean, but no air conditioning in a place like los angeles is brutal. the rooms were unbearable. it was cooler sitting in the sun than in the room. also 4 toilets/showers for the whole hostel is a joke. especially when only 1 of them works properly. also no laundry facilities, nearest laundromat is a 30 minute walk. i'm not usually one to pick on facilities because i expect basic from hostels, but previous samesun hostels were so much better. sort it"
England,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the hostel was awesome! the location made it even better. we were able to check in early and courtney was able to give us a upgrade on our room. the staff there are awesome and really helpful. the next time i go to los angeles i will deffiently be staying there again!
France,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"ideal location, just by the beach and easy access to food, drinks + public transportation. rooms are nice and quiet. beds are comfortable. many fans in the room but still way too hot!  2 bathrooms on each floor, which is actually enough. never had to queue up. however, probably missing some hooks or something to hang clothes/towels while in the shower. breakfast is very basic: pancakes, toast and some fruit.  common area is a great place to meet people! overall good experience, would return !"
Russia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,hi there! my stay in this hostel was really good! i like stuff there &amp; atmosphere.
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,4,8,8,4,6,10,8,"great location except there are a lot of homeless people living around the hostel but is expected in la.  the wifi didn't work the whole time i was staying here which was a huge problem - we wanted to order an uber and no wifi in surrounding area. finally had to beg the guy at the desk to use his uber app as we were late for a concert. it's the 21st century - you need to have working wifi, especially for foreign travellers.  also no air conditioning - stuffy room. good atmosphere though "
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,great hostel in a amazing location! wifi was down for a while during my stay but was resolved. staff were great!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,air conditioning in the rooms instead of fans and on sight laundry although the cleaners on main did an amazing job.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"dom is a very fun, energetic guy. we enjoyed when he ran social events. never had a dull moment when he was around. the wifi was very unreliable during our stay. all other facilities were clean and working. staff were great."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"stayed for 3 nights. location is absolutely perfect, pretty much on venice beach and 2 minutes from muscle beach. great area with beaches, surfing and bars nearby. free street parking a few blocks away and a decent breakfast free every morning. kitchen gets cramped but decent facilities. decent sized rooms but no ac so had to keep the windows open (and venice beach is still vibrant at night). overall clean hostel and chilled atmosphere."
Mexico,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,8,10,"this hostel is very nice! and it is very well located close to main streets and easy accesses.  staff are friendly and willing to help any time!  what i missed a little was to have more atmosphere, but maybe as i was busy i didn&amp;#39;t really get the time to talk to anyone.  awesome value for money! i would definitely come back!    "
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had such a great experience here. the staff was very welcoming, and friendly. they were also very professional. and the atmosphere was awesome."
Germany,Female,18-24,2.9,2,4,2,2,2,6,2,worst hostel in the us so far. read the reviews earlier and didnt expect it to be that bad. it was smokin hot in the rooms and the van didnt change that. too many people for such a small room. the bathrooms were really dirty and the idea of showing you key to a camera to get in is just bad.  the staff wasnt friendly at all. i dont expect too much since ive been travelling for years now but this hostel was worst than all the other
Canada,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,6,6,6,8,"staff was inconsistent in their words and actions. you ask one person they say one thing and in 5 minutes you ask another person at the desk and they tell you different thing. no bike storage is a minus. also the building gets very hot during the day, i personally couldn't sleep at night."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very clean and tidy hostel. staff were very friendly and happy to answer all my questions. nightly activities were a great way to meet people - was nice that a staff member came around to the rooms to see if you wanted to join. great location down by the beach. very good!
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely killer, best location, friendly staff, great breaky, super clean. highly recommend"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best location in venice beach! the staff are great and always willing to help. clean. close to everything you need.
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,staff and location were both great. i can't fault the place. the best bars and shops are off to the left down the board walk passed the new beach.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,sophie at the desk was top notch service!!! but could have done with ac in the warmer rooms!
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"excellent location, just steps away from the beach. the hostel and staff are good, the beds are ok. they serve pancakes, toast, fruit and cereal as breakfast which i tought was really good. the only downside of the place must be the heat inside the rooms. i had the luck of staying at a room with a window to the beach so it wasnt very hot and i slept ok, but in summer it must be unbearable. if you want to stay as close to the beach as possible its a great option!"
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my partner and i stayed here for a week. really loved the location of the hostel. the front desk staff were really friendly and the daily activities are great. loved the pancake brekkie!!

Australia,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,"in my one night stay i was very impressed. great location, great staff, very helpful and good vibes. i would've liked to have been around longer to be part of the atmosphere."
England,Female,25-30,7.4,8,10,10,2,8,8,6,"great location.  there was only 2 toilets per floor and a lot if rooms.  no lift so we struggled with luggage.   no aircon and this place was rediculously hot, we could not sleep well and we was just sweating after we showered - this really ruined our stay in a nice friendly hostel  "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,amazing access to venice beach!
Lithuania,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"absolutely enjoyed my stay in this hostel - location is perfect! if you want to stay by the beach in la - this location is perfect, however, bear in mind that is far away from all other attractions. venice is beach is very nice and if i come back, this is the place i will choose again! breakfast was really good - enjoyed the pancakes. staff was great too - very helpful and rooms were nice - each of us had separate light and plugs by beds."
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"our two night stay at samesun could not have been better - the hostel was clean,welcoming and friendly and abby d was the most accommodating. she was always on hand to greet you with a smile and give you advice on what to do. i will definitely stay again if im back this way - so great!"
Australia,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,4,2,10,6,8,"the building is old, which in turn has old infrastructure. the ducted air conditioning was stuck on a setting way to hot. myself and three room mates were sweating each night for 3 consecutive nights. there is a roof fan that does not blow downwards. there are no pedestal fans available.   the general safety after dark is concerning. we were a group of 6ft 4+ males who can handle themselves, yet we felt unsafe. the amount of drunks, vagrants and general gangbangers loitering is concerning."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,great place but so hot in the rooms with only one small window that doesnt even lead to an actual outside area! more fans!!!
England,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel, lost of fun, great staff and perfect location !"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,"the hostel was clean and spacious, and the beds were comfortable for dorm beds! the staff were super friendly and helpful, and if they didn't know something they would ask around until they were able to help you. the only issue we had was that it was suffocatingly hot in our room, and the whole hostel was very hot. we would walk around steamy 28*c la and then come back to the hostel and it would be warmer inside. we slept very poorly, dripping with sweat, despite the (very loud) fan in the room."
USA,Female,18-24,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"the staff seemed to be a little rude upon our arrival. they were busy as they were checking in multiple people at the same time, but we were scolded for not bringing our passports which we were unaware we had to have to stay at the hostel. thankfully they ""bent the rules"" for us."
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,8,6,"amazing location, good people and no real issues.  ac will be cheaper and better than 3 fans per room. seriously, central air con. i'll fit it for you. the motors in the fans produce  more heat, the fan doesn't cool you and it's hotter than the sun's core in them rooms.  you know that scene in titanic where they run through  the engine room and guys are shoveling coal into the fires? that's the dorms.  you know when you open the oven door and suffer the heat blast? that's permanent."
Sweden,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,6,6,10,6,8,"probably one of the cheapest stays in the la beach area, and with great staff and clean rooms. it was a little too ""rustic"" for my personal tastes, and there's no ac in the building, only fans, so the heat can be pretty heavy. the rooms are ok, even though there are only dorms,  and felt pretty fresh (except for the heat). i didn't have any problems with my room-mates though, and the atmosphere overall in the hostel was very friendly. even though i messed around with my booking, i got a refund."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, staff are super friendly, rooms are clean with comfy beds. bathrooms are all clean with good showers! 100% recommend. "
Switzerland,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"best location to stay at venice beach!  10% off at the surf and bike rental store next door!  pancakes, oranges, juice, coffee, toast, etc. for breakfast.  great atmosphere with lots of cool people!  30min walk away from santa monica pier and 5min walk to the muscle beach!  great place would absolutely recommend it!"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is the best hostel i have evever stayed at. the location and staff make it worth th stay, especially jordan. he is an absolute legend! ask him about all the cool spots!"
England,Female,18-24,6,2,10,8,2,8,6,6,there was no air and the room was like 30c when it was only 20c outside everyone was up so early because it was sooo hot
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,10,8,had a great stay at samesun. would definitely stay again :)

England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"second time staying here. right on the beach, so good location. friendly and helpful staff. good atmosphere. the room got quite hot. bit annoying there's no lift and a lot of stairs if you're carrying a heavy suitcase but if that's the biggest complaint can't be bad. would recommend this place"
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff were friendly helpful. facilties were clean and accomodating. no weird odors. left my passport and my pants there by mistake. i just called and the staff secured my belongings for me to pick up later! great folks. would recommend.

Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,rooms need air conditioning

England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,10,8,6,really nice hostel in a good location . keen to get everyone involved in activities 
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"staff at the hostel were always great fun! were always looking for an event to conduct and get people mixed together. the location on the boardwalk of venice beach was amazing and convenient. all the facilities were good and in working order except for the rooms had a mixed quality of air conditioning. one room had three wide open windows whilst the rooms in the middle of the building were awful, with a small window facing a wall and even the 3 fans couldn't keep it cool thus a sleepless night."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,very nice location
England,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,"great hostel, although the showers are a little iffy! superstar staff and most awesome location... miss it already!! "

Poland,Couple,31-40,6,2,8,8,6,6,4,8,just to expensive
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel, perfect location, great beach views. staff are really friendly, special thanks to jordan for looking after me and shout out to bae for being her brilliant self. also, high five to kyle - hardest working man in america. "
England,Female,25-30,5.1,4,4,10,4,6,4,4,"the hostel has a rubbish lay out, tiny common room as well considering how many people actually stay there. breakfast was barely edible and the hostel staff don't really make eye contact with you and aren't really friendly. the rooms are quite claustrophobic and the heat in there to sleep is unbearable why they can't just invest in air con or some decent fans to make the overall experience a bit more comfortable! location was great but i couldn't wait to leave to be honest."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,location is great! the place is immaculate. love the  security here it's   awesome!
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,10,6,8,i had a great stay. the only problem was that the room was so hot. the ac unit was tiny and barely did anything
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've never traveled before and knowing that there could be places like this reassures me that all comforts are not the same as home. the staff was great, intellegent and caring. very respectful and so down to earth had one of the greatest times in venice and definitely won't forget it any time soon or in the future. dominic is a great guide and knows his stuff i suggest the pub crawl they offer just stay with the group and you'll be okay. you'll meet great people from different paths of life."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stayed here for 4 nights. really really good experience and wished i could have stayed longer. the staff were fantastic - dom and nic organised the social events when i was there and they were both such good fun and made the experience so much better! very cool vibe and the hostel is right on the beach front. great place to meet new people. breakfast was perfect and the hostel was super clean. good system for security and overall an amazing experience. thank you so much!
USA,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,6,10,10,6,"you can't beat the location, right on venice beach! the cleanliness of the hostel was pretty similar to others i've stayed in, although the bathrooms were kinda gross... overall though, it was a fun experience, the staff was friendly, and the location is excellent. i would stay there again! i also really appreciate the free breakfast, as most hostels don't even offer breakfast."
Ukraine,AllMaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff was really great and helpful, nick, abby and jordan are great guys. the atmosphere was superb, couldn't ask for more. really great place to stay. "
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,6,8,8,6,"the dorms were very hot, and there was a slight shortage of bathrooms. the location in venice beach is great, and the staff were very helpful!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"samesun was a great hostel to stay at, the location was the best thing about it. they also had activities on every night, super friendly staff, nice common area, big kitchen and good wifi. the offer company's to do tours/day trips to different places in la and it was just a generally welcoming place. i'll defiantly be staying there again when i'm in la next."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,i had a great time at the samesun  venice beach hostel. everyone was very nice and sociable. the free breakfast was definitely a plus. i will be back... ;)
Scotland,Male,18-24,6.6,6,8,10,4,6,6,6,hostel location is near the beach but far away from other things although that cannot be helped due to the size of los angeles. the rooms were a bit cramped and the kitchen was so small it is impractical to try and cook. the free breakfast was really nice though.
India,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,8,6,"the overall experience was nice. i just thought that the rooms and the lockers were a bit too small. also, it gets quite noisy in the rooms because of the proximity to the promenade. however, they do have a lot of activities going on at the hostel. i would check out more options before booking this one."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is great. if you are traveling to meet people and have a great time this is the place to go.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,thank you for making our first night in venice beach one to remember!
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,4.9,2,6,10,2,8,4,2,smelly room without aircon and shared bathroom for 130$. bathroom was always busy. nice location but that's about it.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"loved this hostel!!! staff are amazing, organise lots of events for you and it is in the best location! great for meeting people. rooms are quite hot as there is no air con but you don't really spend much time in there anyway. would definitely recommend this hostel!"
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.1,4,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you're staying in venice you'll want to be here- palm tree views, pancake breakfasts, and an awesome crew who bring out the best in everyone. big thanks to laura, abby, dan and nick for making our stay so memorable. peace ✌️"
Wales,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great atmosphere and friendly staff. travelled alone but met a lot of cool people and had a great couple of days!
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"room was incrediblyincredibly warm and poorly ventilated, besides that thumbs up for everything."
Italy,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice position right on the beach. only problem: you&amp;#39;ll have to climb up the stairs to get to the rooms, it could be a bit difficult you are traveling with big pieces of luggage."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved the staff! great stay there :) would definitely come back  the staff were so much fun and made you feel really at home. especially on the group outing i went on, dom made sure that everyone was all together and having fun and no one was left behind."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,"best location, right on the beach. staff were beyond lovely."
Sweden,Male,18-24,6.6,4,8,10,4,8,8,4,"there were so many small details that made me feel unwelcome. too few utensils, places to eat, showers, toilets and outlets for the amount of guests. small lockers, no clean water for drinking, worthless shower, dirty dishes and a lack of activities. the kitchen is tiny and poorly equipped. the cleaning personnel stole my towel and the atm charges twice the fee of the ones on the street outside. nothing was a deal breaker and the location is brilliant, but i will be looking elsewhere next time."
Germany,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,very good location and breakfast.common area is too small.
Wales,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice stay 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"samesun venice beach was a great place to stay, typical dorm rooms but cleaned thoroughly everyday. staff were very accommodating and friendly. the other hostel patrons were great"

Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i always go back to the samesun, it's the only place i'll stay when i'm in venice! the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the neighbourhood is lively, vibrant, and very safe. it feels like a true community of people, and i feel right at home when i'm there. can't wait to go back!"
Poland,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,8,6,"i was unlucky to get a room without a window and it was unbearably hot in there. we could not sleep at night:-( despite the fan in the room. even if the night was cooler, the temperature in the room did not change. excellent location. very helpful staff."
England,Male,41+,7.1,4,8,10,4,8,8,8,great set up but major problem with heat in the room and no air con.
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"hostel was good but smelled slowly of wee in the hallways . we were also charged $20 dollars each for a shuttle to the airport but found out after our deposit we could get an uber for $10 and the guy on reception told us that it would be more expensive for a taxi , which was a lie . hostel could do with air conditioning as is too hot at night an kitchen is too small , apart from that it was clean and we had a great time at venice beach !"
Switzerland,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,the only drawback was that the wifi was down for my hole stay...
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel was great!!! awesome staff (shout out to abby) great atmosphere and great location. can't wait to stay here again!!
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and i was literally steps away from the beach. plus, we got pancakes for breakfast. what more do i need?"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,"was booked into room 314- dont know what the other rooms are like, but due to the only window opening up onto a closed-in light well, and the room fan being so ineffective it was impossible to sleep because it was so hot."
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,great location to explore venice &amp; santa monica.  there's a lot going on during the day. at night there are some strange guys at the boardwalk.  still a great hostel!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i only stayed two night wasn't enough! it's a great location, free wifi, free breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. i really liked staying here! "
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"the hostel staff were great, and the vibe at the hostel was really nice with everybody at least saying hello as they passed or striking up a conversation in the common room. the location is awesome; just steps from venice beach, and our room even had a view of the beach. would definitely stay there again."
Denmark,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"it is near-impossible to encapsulate the experience of staying at samesun venice. there's just something about that place that makes for the most amazing times with friends new and old. dominic, the activities coordinator ensures that everyone feels both welcome and constantly entertained - something that can be said of most/all if the staff. and the location, granted, does not get any better. i would recommend this place to anyone whether they are looking to be entertained or mere relaxation."
Scotland,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"samesun sits at the heart of the venice community, located a stones throw from the beach.   upon arrival expect a warm welcome from the engaging and it has to be said entertaining staff. the rooms are what you would expect from a hostel, functional and when all is said its a place to put your head down.   great breakfasts to start the day are complimented enormously by the way the director of fun dominic brings the guests together during the rest. expect fun...laughs and a lot of new friends.   "
Australia,Male,18-24,8,4,10,10,10,8,4,10,"really didn't rate this hostel, common area was tiny so hard to meet people. venice beach sucks in my opinion. hostel is very clean tland safe that's all i can give them."

NewZealand,Female,41+,8,6,10,10,6,10,8,6,"needs a chair and table  in ensuite room. tea and coffee would be nice if available in kitchen,."
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"awesome location.  very satisfied with the cleanliness and room layout.      i thought the nightlife activity could have been coordinated a little better, as we got to the bar and it kind of felt like a ""you're on your own."" but the guy taking us on the tour asked me to buy him a beer which i thought a bit unprofessional (it's one thing for me to want to buy you a drink).     that's really the only thing i can pick out of this place and at the end of the day it's not that big a deal. good stay."
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we had a fantastic stay at samesun. all the staff were great. they were friendly and very helpful. the location of samesun is just the best! i would recommend it to anyone. only small issue was that because of some renovations being underway the noise from the office travelled up to our room through the window but i'm sure that will be sorted soon enough. a unique experience for me as i've never stayed in a hostel before. thanks heaps jan brown
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my sister and i have both stayed in many hostels all over europe &amp; america, &amp; this is by far the best! the location is the best &amp; the atmosphere during the day is like no other!rooms are cleaned daily &amp; you feel safe and comfortable in them! the staff are the friendliest hostel staff i've ever met! especially jordan &amp;the silver haired girl :d. i've stayed at the another hostel in venice and also a hostel in sm, but this is by far the best!! in fact we left our hostel in hollywood just to come bk"
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,4,10,10,8,"friendly and professional staff created a great environment and encouraged meeting other travelers. great hostel security too with staffed reception 24hrs which only opens the door for guests with a roomkey. facilities are out-dated however, showers are pretty bad but that is my only issue.   would definitely reccomend :)"

Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,6,6,8,"the hostel is in a really good location, we just found our room to be extremely stuffy with no fresh air and the common room is tiny which makes it difficult to hang out in to meet other people staying at the hostel. and with no wifi in the rooms the common room was often crowded with no where to sit."
NewZealand,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,6,10,6,the atmosphere was great in the common room however no hot water at all and the bathrooms were not the cleanest. still good to be right on the beach though

England,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,6,6,10,10,"awesome location, had a perfect view of the beach from my room. staff were hit and miss with regards to activities, the rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard.  overall a good a good place to stay as long as you have done washing before hand as the hostel doesn't have laundry facilities.

Canada,Couple,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,4,8,8,6,"this hostel is in an awesome location and the staff are super friendly. the showers and wifi here are the worst though (no hot water at any time of day, the wifi works in 1 specific corner of a hallway - which sucks if you're trying to book more travel etc, as its hard to know if something is confirmed when the wifi drops out mid-transaction). however, the place is clean, the breakfast is decent and everything in venice beach is at your doorstep"
Canada,Female,25-30,6,8,4,8,6,4,4,8,"i thought the staff was ok but they never answered my questions or request right away. i always had to insist. i really enjoyed my private room with tv, fridge and an amazing view of venice beach."

Germany,Male,18-24,5.7,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,please bring wifi to all rooms!
France,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i arrived in the hostel right after having landed in la after a long trip from london, and i could not be better welcomed! greg explained me everything there was to know about the place and the activities organized by the hostel. immediately after i got to my dorm, i was invited to go out for drinks and playing pool and met very cool people! i even got a free surf lesson during my stay by a british guy. just if you have a car, this is not the easiest place to get free parking."
England,Male,25-30,5.7,2,8,8,4,6,8,4,given bad directions to the hostel as instructed on this site. waited at the bus stop for 45 minutes before asking a bus driver if the bus was still running. took a taxi (30 dollars) as the bus had stopped and received an apathetic apology. other staff were very helpful.
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff really helpful!!!!
England,Female,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,8,10,"amazing location right on venice beach in the thick of it! be warned there are a massive flight of stairs to get up to the hostel, great for security, not so good for weary arms!overall nice place, common area to sit and meet people, they do events every night which would mean making friends is easy!they have a quiet time between 11 and 7 but i had some idiots in my room come in at 4am talking loudly but prob just bad luck! i didn't get female only though i'd booked that so make sure you check"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,great staff and great vibe. best location i've ever seen for a hostel and the staff always have something for you to do. there's a great common room that everyone hangs out in and socialises and dominic (the local californian guy) is unreal at showing people around and making sure everyone enjoys themselves.
USA,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location and great vibe! so glad we stayed here. the guy who checked us in was great, told us to mention him by name if we were happy with our service. we were 100% satisfied, but i forget his name! he was maybe australian, long hair and very helpful and enthusiastic!"
Croatia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a friend recommended me this place last minute. very friendly and helpful staff, nic and the rest of the team.  prompt answer about check in time over email. quite safe and easy accesible from lax and santa monica. decent common areas where one can meet bunch of cool people. only small issue was cranky internet connection..."
Australia,Female,41+,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,classic hostel experience with great friendly staff and while i was there one of them took us on an outing like cycling up the sea-front.  living room has a great view of the beach and is conducive to conversation - met lots of fun travellers!
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,if i do go back i will defiantly stay there. everything was amazing. the only thing i didn't really like was that they ran out of coffee 2 days around 9am and bread on the 3rd day. i feel that if they say breakfast is 730 until 930 they shouldn't run out 3/4 of the way thru but other then that it was perfect.
Australia,Female,31-40,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,in need of a lot more bathrooms. 
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is definetly a fun hostel with the most friendliest staff (nic from 'stralia) i've met during my cali trip. keep going guys
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my 2nd  time staying at samesun and it was even better than i remember! the staff are so friendly and helpful, big shout out to abby and sara who made my trip so great! the hostel is in a fantastic location steps away from the beach, the rooms are spacious and everything was super clean. security at night made me feel really safe, you had to show your key before being buzzed up. the hostel activities were awesome and a great place to meet people.amazing hostel! definitely reccommend!!"
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, 20 seconds away from venice beach. the beds and showers were fine, the only disappointment being the limited breakfast. would still recommend..."
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location!
Germany,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff at this hostel is amazing. they made me feel so welcome right from the start. everyone was super friendly and helpful when i had questions about the area. speaking of, the location is amazing. it´s right at the boardwalk and skatepark. lots of bars and restaurants in the area as well.   the hostel itself was very clean, the shared bathrooms were always clean, so was the kitchen area and the common room. i had a great time in venice and a wonderful stay at the samesun hostel."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, great staff, awesome breaky in morning, my room was sweet looking out onto the beach, great value for the money and nick is a legend good guy to had around , top bloke."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a good weekend in venice beach. i enjoyed the stay at the samesun hostel a lot. i joined a few of their daily activities. it´s a great way to explore the area and meet new people. it was a great vibe in the hostel. the staff was super chill and nice. possibly the best staff i met when staying at hostels!! super clean rooms and so close to the  beach! can´t wait to check out more of the samesun hostels on my trip to canada.
England,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,my passport was stolen from my room but the staff helped me out in a calm and useful way.
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"its close proximity to venice beach is its major selling point, so if that's what you want then there's nothing wrong with staying here. most of the staff where either from australia or nz."
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,10,6,6,pretty expensive for what you get but definitely can't complain about the staff or location. nick in particular was a bit of a legend.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great staff, good relaxed atmosphere, the best location in venice!"
Ireland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is hands down the best hostel i've stayed at! where to start?!... the location is unbeatable with the beach a 20second walk away and great bars and restaurants surrounding (danny's, larrys and townhouse to name a few)  the rooms are bright and spacious and the beds are so comfy! the staff are great! really fun and happy to give advice on things to do and see. the samesun have definitely put their stamp on this hostel and there is no question, this is the hostel to stay at in venice!!"
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed staying at samesun. the staff made my friend and i feel very welcome and helped us in any way we needed. the location was ideal, and the facilities were more than great. shout outs to the boys who work at the venice beach location in l.a, you were wonderful, made me feel so welcome and showed me a good time all around! i miss this place and will definitely be returning with friends in the next month or two! thanks!"
Canada,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"my trip previous to this one was in 2008, when the place was the ""venice beach (c)otel"". love this hostel so much. great times and memories. happy to see that the place is only getting better, with vibe strong and logistics pretty effective. bravo to the staff and management. if you want a great, happy place to stay in venice beach, this is the one."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved my stay here! such a great location and the staff were very friendly. there are also lots of awesome places to eat and drink within a few steps. highly recommended.
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"compared to a lot of other hostels it was very clean and modern. you feel safe as the staff makes sure nobody that is not a hostel guest gets in. the stairs are a minus because with a lot of luggage its pretty painful. staff was friendly, didn't show me around though. all in all, i enjoyed my stay even if i still think that 48$ a night is quite a lot. breakfast was okay - very simple. location is top - right at the beach."
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a wonderful time at samesun venice. the staff there is amazing. everyone was so friendly and helpful , very good vibe. the rooms and common areas are very clean. the best thing about this hostel is the location! directly at the boardwalk, skatepark and the beach. they have great daily activities which is amazing, so much fun hiking and biking with new people everyday. dominic- director of fun : you rock! thanks samesun venice for an amazing time."
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,4,10,10,8,"hostel is located right in the heart of venice beach. the staff are very accommodating, and the atmosphere is very welcoming. free pancakes and toast in the morning is also a plus. however, if you choose not to go with an ensuite, the bathrooms are few and far between. also, the showers barely work. you'll get a drizzle at best. it's also quite a distance from other parts of la, and finding parking is brutal. all in all, it was not a bad place to rest after a long day."
USA,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,10,2,8,8,6,"the most disappointing thing about this hostel was the public bathrooms. the showers were pathetic. out of the 4 showers, 2 had absolutely no water pressure in that only drops were coming out of the shower head making it impossible to shower. the other 2 showers were only marginally better. there was enough water coming out of the shower head in order to get clean but they weren't respectable in any sense of the word."
USA,Female,18-24,5.4,6,6,8,4,2,6,6,"extremely rude and unoccomodating customer service:  the blonde receptionist actually asked me if i was ""capable of speaking"" when she asked me a question and i did not immediately answer (i did not hear her right away and had already done what she was requesting me to do) she then sneered at us for the remainder of or stay. it made us uncomfortable just to walk past the front desk."
Canada,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"my stay at the samesun venice beach was amazing! the hostel location simply couldn't get any better. with ocean views from the room i was in i felt totally relaxed.  the hostel staff are by far the best i have met anywhere on my travels; they are professional and courteous, and they make sure you feel at home. i travel to l.a. plenty and will be sure to stay here again, and again !"
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,staff were excellent great location very secure and bathrooms/ensuites were pristine. cant complain at all!
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,6,8,10,8,10,10,10,"location is really good, and the common area is a great spot to socialize and meet people. staff was good as well. it's a little on the pricey side but you pay for location."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,4,8,8,4,"the location is absolutely perfect if you are looking to stay at venice beach. honestly, the location is about all this hostel has going for it. the facilities were not clean. our room smelt as we were situated near a bathroom. also, the internet doesn't work outside of communal areas."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,the staff at this hostel really make the place! they all go above and beyond to create a fun and sociable atmosphere. perfect place to stay if travelling by yourself!
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,6,10,very good place to stay! close to the beach and there are good restaurants and options to drink a beer and eat some food. i recommend!
Romania,Female,25-30,4.9,2,8,8,2,6,4,4,"i´ve rated this hostel lower, because after reading some very good reviews i had higher expectations. it´s not a good value for the money. after i moved from there, i rented something through airbnb , which was much cheaper,  nicer and cleaner and the host was willing to help me more with info and everything."
Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,very friendly staff. perfect located and everythink so nearby!  was great thanks a lot!!!
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"staff are great, fantastic atmosphere for those traveling, and really easy to meet people at this hostel. its in a great location, was a fantastic stay."
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,absolutely amazing hostel right on venice beach. the staff were awesome. nic and issiah were so cool. i wish i were them. great atmosphere with friendly hostel mates. 
Jamaica,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"the bread and butter of this hostel is really the location. it's excellent for a beach bum like me who just wants to lay out on the sand or go rollerblading all day. i  was placed in a room with 3 staff members, all boys, but the bathroom was super clean and that's all i really need in life! it got a little noisy at night, but i guess that's the price you pay for the location. i look forward to coming back to this hostel any time i go back to venice."
Canada,Male,41+,6,4,4,8,4,10,6,6,the location is lovely right on the beach but with location comes some security challenges at the front door as it is remote to the desk and is controlled via a camera which people can avoid by sneaking in behind guests.  the bed was the hardest i've ever slept on.  staff was great.  
Spain,Female,25-30,6.6,4,8,10,6,6,6,6,"very good location, just in front of venice beach. a bit expensive for what you get, but i guess it's the location.    breakfast was disappointing, fruits and spreads other than butter would have been nice."
Denmark,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, great staf and easy to meet other guests on the hostel. space could be better and sometimes noice from the commen area late night. this is the place to stay if you are going to venice!"
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,brilliant stay at samesun. the location was perfect for my relaxing stay at the coast. the room was clean and spacious with a gorgeous ocean view and the rest of the hostel was of a high standard with good security.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,10,8,6,6,8,"a nice hostel! i found it not particularly welcoming, but a great location at venice beach!"
Australia,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,10,6,6,6,4,"i only stayed 24hrs and only slept there, as i was out and about. great location, awesome! couldn't be closer to everything. but i waited over an hour to check it which wasn't a great start for me. ok if it takes that long, but i was told to sit and wait when i could have used that time out at the beach. i had a private room which made it expensive for what i gor, but that's understandable in the area. needs more bathrooms for sure, waited for ages for a shower in the morning. staff were ok."
Mexico,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"excelent place! perfect location, would totally recommend it and i'm definitely staying here next time. "
Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,10,6,"it's a really good hostel with a great atmosphere. especially if you're travelling alone you'll have a lot of people to connect with as there is a big common area where people gather. the free breakfast (pancakes, toasts, oranges, &amp; coffee) has the very basics, but you wouldn't need more. the kitchen is well supplied and so you can also cook for yourself if you want to avoid the expensive but good venice beach fast food. you won't find a better deal when it comes to location+price."
Norway,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"if you are looking for the full venice experience this is the place to go. with great staff and atmosphere there is no question you will feel welcome at this place! get ready make friends, party until the break of dawn and see the most beautiful sunset of your life. location is as central as it could come and you will be safely locket away in the hostel for it's security and 24 hour reception is always on guard. if you ask me this is the la experience!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"seriously the best place! great for anyone on their first time in la! everyone is really friendly and it's accessible to so much, and the free brekkie is the goods."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"was a friendly place, facilities were kept clean and great location. staff werr great recommending and helping set up uber of cheap cabs and helped answer any other questions."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"arrived from a long international flight at 7:30 am and check in wasn't untill 3pm, but the manager was amazing and got us in early, even upgraded us to a private room.. great location, helpful staff (except for the morning guy who pumps kanye at 6:30am- that cray!!) clean, safe rooms. perfect for what we were after"
Canada,Female,25-30,6,4,6,8,4,8,6,6,the only place you can get wifi is in the hallway next to the atm. is it that hard to get a few routers and place them near the rooms?
USA,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,8,stayed one night. the staff was friendly and the location is nice to explore venice beach. overall a nice stay.
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,internet never works
France,Male,31-40,6.9,6,8,8,4,8,6,8,"decent hostel, but it could do with a bit of a makeover... what annoyed me the most is the cold showers! by 10am, not hot water whatsoever."
Netherlands,Male,41+,6.9,2,8,8,6,8,8,8,"although this was an ok hostel i would not advise people because their wifi is so bad you can not call it wifi, they have a router but that's it you can not use it for anything. therefor i think it is bad value for money because it is a ripoff if they not invest in a good internet connection for the traveler who has to plan a schedule everything online. it is 100 bucks per month to get good internet if they are not willing to do that it is bad customer service."
Turkey,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we had a great time at samesun. courtney at the desk was super helpful. we recommend this one to everybody who wants to chill out at venice beach.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel! the hostel is clean and tidy. the staff are helpful and fun! i would recommend this hostel for someone looking for a good location in venice beach. 
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,such a fun place in a great location! staff were amazing! certainly a place i'd return to. they organise cheap dinners &amp; events. 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,will not find accommodation in venice beach cheaper than this. stayed in a 4 bed dorm twice and both times had an amazing view of the beach and boardwalk. also if you skateboard the skate park is literally 100 metres away... highly recommended!!
Brazil,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,6,6,4,6,2,just go to santa monica! trust me!
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,"pros: great location, friendly staff, felt safe cons: the bedroom was cold (apparently a problem with heating), there were no city maps available when i asked and there seemed to be no way to produce more. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"my stay here was really awesome!  dominic, the director of fun, lead us on some memorable trips around the area including bike rides to temescal canyon for a hike and the next day, hermosa beach for lunch.  highly recommend samesun venice beach!"
England,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"loved the free breakfast, especially pancakes! activities during day seemed like great idea and taking out groups in the evening for food/open mic nights really lovely - would have taken advantage of this more had we been here longer but took a while to get over the jet lag! showers temp was a bit dodgy.  wifi was great and staff were all really helpful. would recomend and stay again."
USA,Male,41+,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,"most of the staff was friendly, but the manager(they reluctantly gave our her name abby) was extremely rude and when we went back to pick up our luggage verbally attacked my son and said he had not stayed the prior night because he didn't have a key. the other workers informed her she was wrong and that we had both stayed in the hostel the night before, but instead of apologizing she told us to leave. hostelworld is great, but should not be associated with samesun  venice until abby is fired."
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,"this hostel was pretty good! if you like venice beach, it's in a prime location. having stayed at hostels in both venice beach and hollywood, i would actually say i'd prefer hollywood for its accessibility. venice is pretty dead at night, and it's extremely time consuming to travel anywhere via public transportation. that said, no complaints about the hostel. it was comfortable, quiet enough to sleep, and had a decent common area. the staff wasn't overly friendly but they were accommodating."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,4,8,10,8,10,8,10,"the hostel is ideally located if you're keen on spending time around venice beach, marina del rey and santa monica, which are really cool areas. the facilities are clean and generally pretty cool and the beds are comfortable. the vibe at the hostel is also pretty great (the staff are all fun). my only criticism is that it is very expensive for what it is."
England,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,"hostel is nice enough, would recommend an end suite as fighting for bathrooms is a nightmare. personally wouldn't stay here again, didn't feel there was much socially to bring people together. location is amazing though and staff are helpful and friendly. "
Wales,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,4,8,8,6,"sink was blocked, kitchen is over crowded and the drying plates are really not clean. cleaners were really friendly. lots of people seemed to hang around outside our room and the reception area and were very noisy. venice beach is a little sketchy at night!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,the people/atmosphere and its location is really what makes this hostel. it is exactly on venice beach making the view from some windows very very beautiful. only negative is that one of our showers didn't have a proper shower head and it wasn't super clean and one of our rooms wasn't insulated enough and got quite cold at night. it is deffinitaly your place to be if you're an easy going person :) 
Australia,Couple,18-24,3.7,2,4,6,4,4,4,2,"we paid an excessive amount for a private room. in which we had a tv where we got to watch a great blue screen. a mini bar fridge bed side table that didn't work, and a door that took at least 5 minutes to unlock due to the faulty lock. bathrooms were very unclean and the showers had minimal pressure. when trying to leave one of the desk staff was more interested in talking up one of the guests and taking up the whole stairwell rather than moving to one side."
Australia,Couple,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved this place! best hostel we stayed at in america by far!
England,Female,31-40,8,6,10,10,10,8,6,6,"the location on venice beach is brilliant. i had a room at the back so it was quiet but dark, which was good as i needed sleep. so much gping on in venice beach, you may as well spend time out there. staff very friendly."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i only stayed one night, but it was a pretty good hostel overall.  the room and bathroom were clean and the staff were friendly.  there wasn't as much going on the night i was there, but the people were certainly chill enough.  you can't beat the location though with beautiful beach views."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,bit pricey for a hostel (maybe that's just la). we stayed in a private room with a shared bathroom. bed really comfy compared to other hostels. shower not very hot. free pancakes 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"best place, best people working there, good vibes!"
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, free parking all around the area very easy to find.  very friendly staff, 100%"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"had a great time here, great place to meet people if you are solo, staff are also great, will stay there again if back in venice"
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place was home, and staff was my family during my stay here! the views are incredible, friendly guests and the most warm and welcoming staff ever!! keep up the great work and thank you to everyone who made my stay unforgettable! special thanks to sara for always going the extra mile! will miss this place!"
England,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"awesome location right on venice beach. clean bathrooms. friendly, useful staff. i would stay again in an instant! thanks"
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, great beach front location. highly recommend. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great reception and info from the people working there. very helpful friendly people. with great background music haha
China,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"perfect location if you want to go to the beach! and the beach is the best part of la. ensuite bathroom is pretty handy! great staff! nick, thank you! you're awesome!"
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,4,6,6,6,"great spot, pretty expensive as far as hostels go had to book room three times to stay with friend  staff friendly "
USA,Male,18-24,3.1,2,4,4,2,4,4,2,"i'd suggest the banana hostel. it's in a much more centric location, much better priced, and much cleaner. this hostel was unclean, didn't have lockers, and had sub-par desk service."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,4,8,6,8,"an alright place to stay - good location on venice beach, friendly staff and variable atmosphere. my only complaints are of no hot water showers."
Spain,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"you're one of my best experiences in a hostel. best location ever, best staff ever, and friendliest environment. you guys rock."
Austria,Female,18-24,6.6,6,10,6,6,6,6,6,"the location of the hostel directly at the beach is nice. however, there are a lot of homeless people there and the entire area doesn´t look very safe. the hostel itself is average. the rooms are okay. in the bathrooms there often was no warm water, which can get really frustrating after some time.breakfast was included in the price, but wasn´t good at all. especially because of the location of the hostel in such a sketchy area, i wouldn´t stay there aga"
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,6,8,"the hostel is really near to the beach so if you are coming to la to enjoy the sea this is the perfect place. it is also possible to go to santa monica walking. the beds are good and the place is ok, i really liked it and enjoyed the location. the only problem is for going to downtown without a car, it is very very very far and for every place(like beverly hills, hollywood, museums, etc) that i went i had to take around 2 hours in buses to go and more 2 hours to return to the hostel."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,jordan at samesun venice deserves special mention. he was very friendly and was my favourite staff member. 
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,6,6,"terrific staff, i had a great time talking with everyone and they were informed regarding the locale."
Taiwan,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"i had not really good experience when i was there, because the roommate brought a guy back in our female room. it made me  really uncomfortable."

Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,everything about samesun was perfect. however they don't have a very good communal area to meet people. i was only there for 3 days though so i didn't really get to experience any of the proper group activities. 
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. best location and heaps to do in the area. the staff are freaking awesome and keep the vibe going around the place - especially thanks to jordan for the sick skating lessons on the boardwalk. already planning to come back here asap.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"i only stayed for a few hours but it was good.  there was always a taxi cab nearby if needed.  right next to be beach and other facilities.  a few ""interesting"" characters out and about but that didnt bother me at all.  good place to stay"
Scotland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"fairly basic hostel with a great location (20m away from the beach). staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms were comfortable - the common area is comfortable but if you're looking to socialise the bars outside are really the best place."
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"lovely happy staff, always ready to advise and support. the location is one of the best."

Slovakia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we extended stay for more 2 nights. all is here awsome. but i would expect in comfirmation email by you an important information that this hostel strictly requires passport!!!!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"really nice staff, they help create an awesome atmosphere. the hostel has a really chilled and fun vibe, great for those travelling alone with the organised activities and use of the common room. right on the beach."
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.1,2,8,10,6,10,6,8,the staff are very helpful and cool.  location is awesome right on the beach.  but in general it's very expensive for a hostel but i guess that's la.  venice beach area seems to be more expensive than other parts of la surprisingly even more so than hollywood blv.
USA,Male,41+,7.7,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,"its all good. my travel was part business and part leisure the hostel fitted my needs nicely. ,"
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,8,6,8,6,6,"best location to stay in la. venice is awesome.  hostel is good. nothing special, but we had no problem there. staff is nice, bathrooms are clean, and bedroom as well."
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,"perfect location for venice beach, right on boardwalk. unfortunately no atmosphere at all, way too small common room, bathrooms very unclean, no one participating in activities. shame! "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,i can highly recommend the hostel. the people were great the staff helped us with everything and  booked additionaly they booked a van for us. really cool hostel next to the beach in the center of venice beach.
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,i liked the hostel. i had the 4 bed dorm with a private bathroom. beds were ok at bed but the place was cleaned daily. bring you own pillow if you are fussy but apart from that this is a good hostel in a great location for the beach. they did clean the hostel everyday. the staff were friendly and helped whenever possible. 
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"hostel is great. i booked three more nights after my first three because it is so close to the beach and i hears hollywood and down town la weren't really worth going. wifi is not the best, couldn't connect to it in my own room. but i really liked my stay and people were awesome! i would really recommend the place"
Italy,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"it was ok, nothing fancy."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a perfectly awesome stay! thank you so much.
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,8,8,8,10,10,8,great staff and location opposite venice beach and close to buses for transport to downtown la. venice the area itself seems a little rough/scary but so are most parts of la. our private room with ensuite was good and clean :) free toast and oatmeal for breaky was perfect for busy days. thanks to the awesome staff :)
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved this hostel!
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i thought this hostel was fantastic. i thought the value for money was second to none, especially given the prime location of the hostel. iso impressed with the staff - one in particular who was incredibly helpful (i'm struggling to remember his name!!) but was working the shift at 10.30 pm on thursday 2 october.     i was so impressed with this hostel, i will recomment to all friends travelling through venice."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"i absolutely loved my time at samesun!   the staff are super friendly and i felt right at home.   the location could not be better, you're literally 20 steps from the beach. my first night was an ocean view room and the room was super clean. my only qualms were the wifi and the stairs, there are 2 flights up to the front desk, but overall a great hostel with great vibes!"
France,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"very well located hostel in venice. 2 minutes from the beach. if you can, choose the 4 beds dorm en suite. they are bright and clean with a nice bathroom. the 8 beds dorm are way too hot, no a/c, just a fan. "
Germany,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"unbeatable location, helpful staff, reasonable price. what else could you possibly want?"
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff were all awesome and super friendly and you cannot beat the location!
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,7.1,8,10,10,6,4,6,6,"had difficulty checking in. i am a ca resident and did not think i needed to bring a passport. the man at check in made the process very difficult. i explained that i was not made aware of this policy when checking in online. i felt unwelcome as he said the hostel was for travelers only. i brought two australian travelers with me to stay as well, bringing extra business. if you don't want american travelers, say so. "
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, right in the heart of venice. couldn't have asked for friendlier staff, everyone was tremendously helpful and welcoming. definitely recommend staying at samesun, it was a highlight of our trip!!!!"

Sweden,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"stayed here at the start of my first trip to california, and it was definitely a good start. it had a party atmosphere, but still felt secure in a very lively area. cleaned professionally every day. lots of activities courtesy of dominic, director of fun! "
Hungary,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,10,8,8,8,awesome place!make sure you go out with dominic!he is sound!
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"really enjoyed staying here. great location right on venice beach, walking distance to the beach, skate park and basketball courts. staff really friendly and helpful, very good free breakfast of oats, toast, coffee etc. room i had was 212 and really hot and uncomfortable but otherwise ok. showers not the best, at least on first floor, better upstairs. cool common area to hang out in, i enjoyed the free comedy on saturday night. some rooms even have ocean views. great times in venice beach!!"
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really glad i booked here.  amazing location, fun staff and great roommates!"
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a great time at samesun!  the staff were super friendly and helpful.  i was only there for one night, so i didn't participate in the activities but they offered one every day and they seemed awesome.  the location was the absolute best, literally right on the beach."
England,Couple,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the location is so good for anyone travelling about wanting some sun and sea, and only a short walk to santa monica! staff were friendly and helpful"
Germany,Female,18-24,6,4,6,10,4,8,6,4,"stayed in a 4 shared room with baathroom, didn't have wifi acces in our room so had to go to the common room. breakfast was plain (bread and jam and cornflakes). it was a bit dusty in our room and the sheets had a few stains. the staff was nice and the view from the common room was great! could see the beach. so if you're willing to trade cleanliness and wifi with great location it's your place to stay."
HongKong,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"the location is very good, and it is just in the beach side where you can see the beach from the window of the room i stayed.  i can walk to the beach in 1 minute too.  however, there is no air-conditioner in the hostel.      the breakfast is ok where you can make toasts."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"lovely new sheets and mattresses. friendly staff. i mentioned i didn't sleep well because of the heart wave and they juggled some things to put me in a cooler room. went out on some of their activities and had a great time. went for tacos with staff and backpackers, all very friendly. even the cleaners were friendly and did a great job everyday. thank you very much for a lovely stay. another great samesun hostel. "
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had to give this a full rating! amazing view from my window and common area window. awesome atmosphere in such a buzzing location there's always something to do. would definitely stay again! rooms were warm but it's california, can't really complain about amazing sunny weather at the beach!"
Wales,MixedGroup,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,10,6,very pricy for a hostel. very basic interior but good atmosphere and location. would recommend for young people/groups.
Ireland,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,a better breakfast selection including even cereals would enhance this hostel experience for many
England,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"what a hostel!! right in the heart of venice beach. super friendly staff that were happy to help with anything i asked! lots of fun activities  to get involved with around the city, or if you are feeling lazy the common room was a great place to meet new people and have a few drinks.     clean facilities and comfy beds, cannot wait to head back there!"
Hungary,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"i loved my staying here. it is very close to the beach and the peope were very friendly there, they helped me so much. i would come back here again."

England,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,very friendly staff made for a very enjoyable stay
England,Female,25-30,4.6,2,2,8,4,8,6,2,"really didn't like this hostel. it was really unclean and dated. we stayed in a usa hostel before this and it was luxury compared to this one.  the sheets were clean, that was about it. towels were frayed and had holes in, the room had dust all around the corners. the bathrooms had mould in them and were not clean.  no air conditioning and couldn't shut the window (there was a headache causing noise like when you keep one window open in the car).  also noisy. not a pleasant stay at all!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"nice place, close to the beach and all the random stuff that goes on around here. very pleasant place to chill"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,really nice location on venice beach. great social atmosphere and really helpful staff.
Australia,Female,41+,6.6,6,8,8,4,8,6,6,"the location is definitely the selling point for this hostel. i've stayed in lots of hostels &amp; this has room for improvement. dorm was like an oven, could hardly sleep it was so hot. only two bathrooms (and no separate toilets) per floor so always waiting. small kitchen and living area.  no laundry facilities though i believe there are plans to put these in.  dorm was an ok size.  no secure room for leaving luggage - the room where you leave bags is open for anyone in hostel to access."
Italy,Male,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"had a great stay! location was amazing, right on the beach. facilities and security are good, keeping up the standard i saw in most good hostels i've been too. standard price, it was an august weekend right on venice beach so i really can't complain :)  staff was great! got the chance to meet a bunch of really nice fun people, still in touch with jose, one of the guys that works there! he's been and they've been all really nice and helpful to someone who just moved to the city. recommended!"
China,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,"very close to beach, good price, a lot homeless people in the night around"
USA,Female,25-30,5.1,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,not very good value for price. run down facility. no air conditioning.  dirty bathrooms. disappointing breakfast. staff had no idea how to make coffee. very disappointed.  
Germany,Female,41+,5.4,4,8,6,4,6,4,6,although the room with bath was ok but to small for four person.  also not nice the vending machine was in the stairwell and the heat of the refrigerator   was released to the stairwell what caused the stairwell to be hot.
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,all very personable. any needs were worked out right away 
England,Male,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,8,10,10,"this place is great. if you can afford to stay here you must. stay in vegas after to balance out the cost per night! right on the boardwalk and by food places. neat kitchen in hostel. my room had a great view of the sea, maybe you can request this! 2 hour bus journey (or 30 min uber) from downtown la, but worth it - la  is a dump. be careful around the greyhound, get a bus or taxi to the main street in downtown. this walk was the only place to scare a 22 year old guy in 7 weeks of travel. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"this was my first time staying in a hostel, and it was far better than i expected. it was very clean. the kitchen had everything i needed to prepare food. however, the lounge is fairly small for how many people they have staying there. but it's a small, older building, and i'm sure they did the best they could with the space they have."
Netherlands,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,a brilliant location next to the venice boardwalk and the beach. beautiful weather and great staff that helped me finding everything i need withing a 30 minute travel. they even arranged movie tickets at the amc dine-in theater which is a must see when you are around.
Belgium,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"it is an expensive place for a hostel, but the location is excellent and the staf very friendly!!"
China,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,nice memory
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location steps away from the beach. the bathrooms were super clean and it was easy to get in and out during the day. a little loud outside during the day, but plenty quiet at night."
USA,Couple,18-24,6,2,8,10,6,4,6,6,"we booked a mixed 4 bedroom shared bathroom for one night during july. there was one small window which opened to the center of the entire building, with no airflow. air conditioning was not included throughout the entire establishment. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"had a very enjoyable night stay at samesun. staff are friendly, facilities are good and a nice backpacker atmosphere. this place is 100x better than venice beach hostel so if you are trying to make a decision between the 2.. choose samesun!"
Egypt,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,the room was really clean and spacious. .breakfast was really good. .it is the best on venice beach 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,6,10,10,10,wonderful hostel - have stayed there twice now and would stay there again! definitely better off booking the earlier the cheaper. only downfall is the closest laundry is a 20 minute walk away.
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i stayed at this hostel for just 1 night, and would have loved to stay another night. its in the best location and the staff are great. the rooms are very clean and spacious, but it is quite expensive for a hostel. "
Canada,Couple,18-24,5.7,4,6,8,4,10,4,4,"room was super hot, and the door had to be left open all day for it to be bearable! only two poorly kept, dirty showers/toilets for an entire floor of dorms. not very clean, shabby, small place. we didn't use the kitchen or common room much, but both were also very small. only good things were location - basically right on venice beach - and staff, who were super helpful."
Netherlands,Male,18-24,7.4,10,4,8,6,8,8,8,good value for money. really nice staf and really close to the beach! rooms are good and clean!
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"great place close to the beach. very clean, great wifi, helpful staff. only problem was there were only two bathrooms on each floor causing a lot of waiting to use them. "
Mexico,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place in venice. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere in the hostal  is great.
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,i stayed just one night. but i had a wonderful day there. the facility was so clean and bed or blanket was so nice. if i happen to visit la again i will stay here too!
Poland,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,great location and staff. people keep quiet at nights. comfty. downside: loud ventilator in my shared room.
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"decent hostel. atmosphere is average. there is no parking for hostel guest though, so if you have a car, i would not recommend staying here. you will have to find street parking, which sucks at venice."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my time here. perfect location right in the centre of the venice boardwalk. nice walk to santa monica. could've been a few extra showers, but that that's no big deal. perfect place to end a 2 month trip away. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,samesun is a great hostel. literally right on venice beach. high secuirty. we had a 4 bed shared dorm with bathroom and we wouldn't have gotten anything else around this area for this great price. very clean and helpful staff.
Denmark,Male,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,there should be more plugs in the rooms so we can charge our phones etc. and shelfs by the beds are nescessary. otherwise greeeeeat hostel!
England,Male,25-30,5.4,4,8,10,2,6,2,6,"the place really really needs some atmosphere, its just boring. the communal area is a joke...why not utilise all that space on the roof and create a rooftop terrace bar??? this would put you guys on the global hostel map!! disappointing overall."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,the staff are really helpful all the time. the location is amazing! the view from the lounge window is great. limited bathrooms but worth it for the great stay.
Germany,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,i stay here always the first nights when i arrive from overseas. it is now the 4th time i've been here and certainly will come back. 
Turkey,Male,41+,7.7,8,8,10,4,8,8,8,"upper floor rooms were very hot, like a owen. altough there were  fans.  they say that breakfast is included. in realty they could'nt have called it breakfast. the word 'poor' remain ' rich'  for it. to my opion, they could rise  a litle bit  (2-3  dollars) daily rate and  offer a more reasonable  breakfast.   i suppose that  such kind of breakfast   are not   served  even in  poorest country of  africa. please, a little more  respect to  human being."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,can't beat the location and the staff was awesome.
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was my first time staying in a hostel and the experience was great! i defintely will be staying in a hostel in the future!
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel, perfect location. staff were very helpful! can't really complain."
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,samesun venice beach is in prime location for coastal life. my partner and i loved this hostel. we've stayed in many and this is at the top. plus there was a tv in the room so we could watch the world cup if too tired to hit one of many cool bars in venice. 
Canada,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,beautiful people and beautiful views!
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,4,8,8,8,"amazing location right on venice beach. i was only there for 2 nights so didn't participate in any of the hostel activities but the staff seemed very helpful. my only complaint is there are a few basic maintenance issues that need attending too. for example, the light in our bathroom was blown for my entire stay, which made it difficult to go the bathroom at night."
Serbia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"stayed here for less than 24 hours, so i can't say much, but the location is perfect! as a girl traveling alone, i was reluctant to walk around at night, so it's a good thing danny's is right downstairs for food/drinks. i had an early flight to catch, so i went to check out the lounge instead of sleeping - i wasn't that impressed. just a couple of dudes on couches staring at their phones. i talked to one guy for a bit, but overall it was a bit boring compared to other hostels. off night maybe?"
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"had a great stay here for our time in la. brilliant staff, always welcoming and helpful. wish i knew the names of specific people to give credit where due. great location right by the beach with appropriate security measures. breakfast is included but is simple and goes quickly so would recommend going down early. would recommend! "
Wales,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"staff were excellent. very friendly, helpful and always welcoming. facilities were good. electric bobs you could use to cook if you wanted to save your money. free breakfast of toast and porridge however milk was not provided. the lounge area would have been great if it was bigger and more for relaxing rather than drinking in the evening.   rooms were very hot and stuffy however clean. air con would have been great in the room or an external window to allow a breeze into the room."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,"good hostel, an excellent location right on venice beach, bike/skate/surf hire right next to the hostel at a good price, good atmosphere. only gripes are: not enough toilets and i was put in a dorm room with no ventilation and a fan that just pushed around the hot smelly air. overall though i would definitely recommend!"
England,Female,31-40,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,"one staff member was fab, helpful and friendly. another staff member was exact opposite hence average score on staff.  i booked samesun venice beach as stayed at vancouver which is fab.  this place nothing in comparison.  the breakfast was dire."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location and clean.
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,6,8,the best location you can get being right on the beach.  just your average hostel not to dirty and just a overall good place to stay
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very helpful staff, very clean and safe. great location. "
Latvia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"beautiful location, friendly staff . lots of sun and fun."
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,sweet place right next to beach and good tours  and met loads of cool people there
England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"fantastic location and the staff were all really friendly! good atmosphere as well. but for what it was, i thought it was really expensive. definitely would recommend if you have a flight from lax and want to stay reasonably close by."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,4,8,"great location and a fair price for the area. common room is too small and hard to meet people. rooms are clean and tidy but power sockets should be available at each bed, not just the bottom bunks. rooms get far too hot and there is no cooling system installed; each room should have its own fan at a minimum; we shouldn't have to bother reception with this minimal request. key system is very outdated; nothing worse than bringing keys out to a pub/club or beach. key-cards fit easy in the wallet!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,expensive but worth it for a couple of days .... location is the best in the area hands down ..... friendly and extremely helpful staff  everything you need is close  clean 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,they defintely need more showers. or just a basic toilette so if the showers are taken i can atleast go to the toilette
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever. on the beach. nice stuff
Brazil,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"hostel really close to the venice beach, which is a famous place. but i prefer beaches like santa monica. for those who like venice beach is great place, small but tidy rooms, shared bathrooms clean most of the time, only 2 per floor, but i always found one free when i needed! very attentive staff."
Germany,Female,18-24,6,6,6,8,6,4,6,6,"staff was really unfriendly and didn't want to help us!  we got a damn 100$-ticket for parking in the red zone. we don't know anything about a ""red zone"" in europe so the staff should have told us about it when they gave us the instructions where we should park!!"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,6,10,10,6,10,4,2,"amazing location, you can't get any closer to venice beach than samsun. great staff as well, super friendly and helpful. security is incredible as you have to ring the door bell and show your key to enter. as for the hostel itself basic basic accommodation. showers were horrendous, didn't have a hot shower once and were never cleaned. room stunk of weed for obvious reasons, fine with that, but no circulation apart from a small window."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,"fantastic location! right in the middle of everything and across from beach.  bathrooms could use an update and and also better ventilation in the dorms as it gets quite hot and stuffy.  lots of different group activities each night but i stayed there to tour venice not go into hollywood in a limo, so a simple pub crawl through venice would have been good."
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,10,6,4,4,8,overall did not have a pleasant stay. the rooms  in bedding were unpleasant as well as some of the staff.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,"i was only here for 1 night but i had a good experience. room was good and the hostel is right on venice beach, so if you want to be in this area it's a good choice. there's a bar/restaurant next door that had a good atmosphere, but there wasn't much atmosphere in the common areas of the hostel when i was there."
China,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,if have more restroom is better~
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,6,8,10,"really good location, directly at the beach. really clean. the restaurant/bar underneath the hostel makes meeting people easy"
Austria,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great location directly on the beach, unfortunately they don't have a common area (e.g, a roof garden) where you could enjoy this marveleous place."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"the beds aren't very comfy but it is a hostel, the main problem tho is that the water pressure is so weak it's hard to shower and also the hot water wasn't hot it was barely warm so if that could be fixed if would be much better..   "
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,6,8,10,"nice hostel, however when we talk about breakfast... i'm so sorry but there isn't"
Finland,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,4,10,8,6,not enough toilets...and the room smelled awful.
USA,Female,41+,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,6,8,found the staff to be very helpfull. i would recommend samsun venice beach
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"great hostel, with great people. every night they have an event, so you get to know a lot of people in the hostel. it is about an hour walk towards santa monica pier, but it is a nice walk. there also busses nearby. at night they say it is not that safe, so you shouldn't be walking by yourself. they have a wonderfull security system and don't let anyone in they don't trust. good kitchen, but also nice restaurants nearby. breakfast was allright. one day they ran out of bread..."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"pretty good hostel overall. easy to get to, fun activities at night and pretty good atmosphere. mindful that 1.5 hours by bus from hollywood. staff are all pretty cool and laid back except one american chick at reception who was a bit rude (abby i think). otherwise great stay, highly recommended."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,have been traveling around america for a while now and this is by far the best hostel we stayed at. staff were excellent especially kate who was always willing to help and organize social events.  if you're traveling to la do yourself a favor and stay here! highly recommend! marco polo
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"fantastic place to stay, pretty much right at the beach. highly recommend."
Austria,Female,31-40,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"nice hostel right in venice, some of the rooms even have ocean view. staff is very helpful and nice. there is breakfast included, but it's nothing special. overall a very nice and clean hostel, would recommend it."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"however, got a parkn tx in five min load zone when i ran upstairs for a few minutes only la traffic cop to get bag from storage closet at 4 pm on my check out day:( "
France,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,8,6,8,8,"i had a nice time at the samsung hostel. it is very easy to meet people, and it is soclose to the beach."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,4,10,staff are helpful.... awful vibe can't really drink inside the hostel
Chile,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,10,8,6,"we stay in a room of 8 people, and there was bevy bad smell, the room has no ventilation, beside that everything was ok, good place to meet new people at the common area. the personal was grate also"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"chill atmosphere, location is prime, and the staff are unreal - shout out to abbey! i had loads of fun here the week i stayed, and definitely heading back at the end of my trip.   "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,awesome hostel. super friendly staff and a great location. met some really cool people there and had a blast. even though the common room is small it is a great place too meet people and go out and get on it!!! definitely recommend.
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"looooooveeee this hostel to bits. amazing location right on venice beach. close to everything you need - coffee shops, bars, shops and markets. super friendly and awesome staff who were really helpful on providing all the info you need. we moved to west hollywood for a couple nights but ended up coming back to samesun because of its great atmosphere. will definitely be coming back soon!! "
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was like a paradise right on the beach, the views were amazing! they offer awesome nightly activities to check out the city with other cool backpackers. abby was so nice and helpful! i've had such a good experience with the samesun hostels and this one kept up the reputation. clean rooms, fun atmosphere and friendly staff right across the board. thanks samesun!!!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,the shower water is cold.  good location and friendly people. 
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,10,6,hostel was in an ideal location and the staff/atmosphere were really good
Germany,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place with perfect location right next to all you need, very clean and quiet in the night.  the good atmosphere was stunning, never experienced that in any other hostel than one of the samesun's yet :)  way better service than what other hostels provide for this amount of money -&gt; value for money: excellent  i would definately recommend it to my friends."
Norway,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,i'd loved it! great location and an intimint atmosphere. i really wanna go back!
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"you can't beat this place! literally steps away from the boardwalk and the beach:) the hostel was great, the staff were very helpful and you're just steps from the entertainment of the venice beach boardwalk. next time i'm in cali, i'm staying here for sure!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"i stayed in a 4 bed room and thought it was good. nice kitchen and good staff. just needed more atmosphere as there's only a small living space. however the huge upside is the location, right in the middle of all the action on venice beach, lots of things to check out. i highly recommend hiring a skateboard or a bike and cruising down ocean ave to santa monica to check out the the pier, or watching local skaters tearing it up at the skate park. i would go back again :) "
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,3.7,2,8,6,2,2,4,2,"i didnt have a very good experience in general.  me and my other 3 friends were having our own room. basically the shower was horrible, really cold, we rented towels (paid 2usd each) and they were sooo stinky, also the sheets were smelling really bad.  there was this turkish guy in charge of organizing the limo party, and he was sooooo rude all the time. he left my friends at the first club and they had to go walking to the next one. he was also never really friendly at us."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,6,10,8,10,"there needs to be another bathroom or 2, or even just a few extra toilets separate from the showers. the main downfall is that it is quite some distance from downtown la or beverly hills, however there are buses which are $1.50 to get into town. they organise activities and take you out if you want to go."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,great spot. staff hooked me up when i really needed. kinda sketchy wifi and cold showers and really thin blanket provided though. other guests a bit lame but not really hostels fault. 
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"pretty good hostel, the area is a little dodgy at night but great by day. only thing missing i would say would've been a computer in the common area."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,great location..100 feet from venice beach. my room shower was a little weak but the hall one was fine. nice and clean. would recommend.
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,10,6,"a great hostel to meet people, with a good range of organised activities, pub crawls, etc. rooms were clean although we believe one of our party fell victim to bed bugs… however would still go back (with caution) as it's an awesome social hostel and in a great location right on venice boardwalk."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good hostel, but it takes over an hour by bus to get to hollywood boulevard. great location if you want to be close to the beach."
England,Male,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,this is a nice chilled out hostel. i stayed here twice. mainly to see the chicks rollerskating in bikinis on the boardwalk.   probably best to come in the spring/summer as the beach will be busier and the hostel rooms can get a bit cold.  but lots to see on the beach and boardwalk or walk along the beach to santa monica.  there is breakfast if you get up before 9am! or you can buy some cherios from a local shop like i did.  area is a bit ghettoy at night but mostly harmless.
Germany,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great, friendly and supportive staff!"
Italy,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it is a very amazing place.. the staff is more than great, always ready to help:-) i arrive 5 hours before chech in and i didn t need to wait because they give me the room.. i just didn t like the people that were in my room:-("
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,6,6,8,8,10,6,8,a bit of a hotel/hostel setup - common areas arent great so the atmosphere is a little lacking. great staff though
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"really enjoyed my stay! great location on the beach. staff were friendly and helpful, plus we got upgraded for free! good atmosphere and free breakfast is always a plus! "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"this is a great place to stay while in vience beach :) grab a bike from the rental dude out the front and go riding up and down the bike path , had a blast there :)"
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such an amazing hostel! i have stayed in all the samesun hostels and they are all fantastic. the location of this one is unbeatable. the staff are super friendly and helpful, sara and abby were awesome! there is great security, the bathrooms are spacious and always clean, rooms are big with great views and the free breakfast is always a plus! i would definitely stay here again!"
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my girlfriend and i stayed at this hostel and it was absolutely awesome.  first off the hostel is located in a prime location (2 mins to the beach). someone was on the desk 24 hrs which made us feel safe.   the staff themselves were very helpful with all of our questions.  abby i think was the one girl on the desks name (she wore a beanie) told us of a great bar to watch football.  sara who i meet in the bar downstairs (had no clue she worked at the hostel)  was a riot to drink with.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,4,8,10,4,10,4,10,"i stayed here for two nights, it was an okay hostel that has the potential to be really great. it is really clean, but overpriced for what it is, for $30 a night it should at least include a free towel and breakfast could be really improved. i know these things sound stupid but details like that are what makes a good hostel great. the best part of the hostel was the comedy night they arranged for us to go to! the staff were really helpful and booked my airport shuttle which was really nice :)"
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,10,6,6,8,"the position of this hostel is great and you can't really fault anything about the place itself. the directions (using coast shuttle) really should be updated as no one at the airport had heard of it an i ended having to pay more for another company. also, the staff were friendly, but not the most helpful. when asked how to get to hollywood, they basically just said it was really far away.. i had to step in and give the guy some actual info. don't let that put you off though!"
Poland,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,6,10,8,6,"the hostel is very well oriented, just in the hottest place of venice. it ok, but not shocking. they've got no parking, but you can easily find a spot nearby (especially during night). i would got there again!"
Turkey,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"best location, best staff and so much fun. one of the best hostel i've ever stay. i'll never ever stay in another hostel in la!"
Portugal,Male,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,10,a bit expensive but worth it. the atmosphere is good and the activities are good.  the rooms are a bit hot.  the location in venice is just perfect.
Netherlands,Male,41+,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"good wifi, smack up on the beach sidewalk. location is really perfect. good connections into la and helpful staff."
Finland,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,location was great! we had dorm room for 4 people and it was clean and nice!
Australia,Couple,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"all seemed good here; it's a perfect place if you're looking to spend time on the beach.  the area seems ok and safe enough, though worth keeping your eyes open when wandering around at night.  the hostel seems a bit of a party place, and sound comes through from the adjoining music venue on occasion - though not for very long, thankfully.  the hostel was a bit hot inside and had a slight odd smell, but it wasn't that big a worry.  overall i was pretty happy with my stay."
India,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,the hostel has great views to the beach and great location. events in hostel are also great and perfect for youths.
Hungary,Female,25-30,6,6,6,10,6,4,4,6,staff not very knowledgeable and not as friendly as expected in a hostel. common area is quite poor and not very easy to meet people. if it wasn't for the excellent location i would not recommend this hostel at all!
England,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great location for venice beach, my fiancé was very keen to visit muscle beach so ideal location as less than 2 minutes walk away.  we did have an issue with the hot water the first night we stayed there, so cold showers for everybody, but think this was a one off rather a regular problem."
England,Couple,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,"good hostel, good location - only issue for us was the shared bathrooms. we were in a room of 8, there were other rooms on a floor...but only two communal bathrooms. not ideal if someone is showering &amp; you need the toilet, particularly if you are in a rush in the morning."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,4,10,8,8,"a great location and really good value for money. the only downside was the limited toilet/showers. 2 single bathrooms on a floor meant that i had 3 days with cold showers...after the room being really cold and staff having no extra blankets it wasn't the best start to a day. other than that no other complaints- comfy beds, friendly staff, well facilitated kitchen and fridge space and very secure. for the price it was gat value- thank you!"
Hungary,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location is amazing, i've never stayed in a hostel with a view of the beach before. the staff were really helpful, and the clubbing tour through hollywood was a lot of fun."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,very good hostel. but don't go to the beach front after sunset!
England,Female,25-30,9.1,10,4,10,10,10,10,10,"good location for access to the beach, friendly staff.  one frightening incident that ruined the hostel reputation occurred when 2 local teenagers managed to slip past the security cameras and knocked on our dorm door, there is a high crime rate along the venice boardwalk with many tourist being held at gunpoint so be aware. in light o the situation, security measures where implemented immediately and the staff apologised."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was great and the entire staff was wonderful.  looking forward to my next stay!
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"when i arrived, i was nearly not allowed to check in because i did not have my passport.  i've stayed at hostels all over the us for two decades and never once was asked for a passport.  i understand that samesun might have a different policy, but the manager was completely rude and aggressive toward me.  i seriously thought that i would be sleeping on the beach that night.  luckily, there was a shift change and the next person let me check in with my government id."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,right on venice beach. only stayed for a stop over but would have been most happy to be there long term. my bedroom window had a view of the ocean.
Poland,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"fantastic location, right on the venice beach, clean, every day activities. i can just recommend:)"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a ball here, great location, great staff, found abbey at the front desk to be very helpful about where to go and what to do etc. p.s go to venice beach ale house!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,8,6,"air con would be ideal however the cost is probably more than its worth so even a $3 standing fan from walmart would be perfect, just for airflow and to keep you a little cooler."
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,6,4,6,8,"i reserved my 2 rooms 6 mons. prior to my stay,not only did your staff get the reservations wrong,they charged me the price for 4 persons when i reserved for 3 for the 1 room.when i informed the staff of the mistake i was offered a 2 person room ( we were 3) or i could look for a new hotel.i will never set a foot in your hotel again.but i doubt that this interest's you very much."
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,4,6,8,4,8,6,4,"would not stay here again. was awesome location right at the beach, and staff were helpful but the hostel is a bit dodgy and not very clean."
England,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,8,10,10,10,"room was actually hotter than the sun! one fan but didn't do enough to cool the whole space. lockers provided. good common room and kitchen, tv, vending machines, fridges and dedicated beer fridge. right on the beach though our room had a view of the neighbouring bruck wall. staff were full of info-even google and printed bus timetables for us."
Scotland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved the place!  awesome vibe with fantastic staff.  fun activities on every night.  great location - can't get any closer to the beach.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,good hostel in great spot on venice beach. cheap food and drinks nearby. hostel was basic and common room was big enough for a dozen or so people. was odd i had to pay for a towel ($2) which was tiny and basic... instead of renting... and then at the end of my stay i handed it back for no refund ...?! only 4 shared showers also - which included the toilet ... so had to wait. otherwise great hostel ... perfect for my one night stopover. venice beach amazing.. 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,6,10,8,10,10,10,"hostel was in an awesome location above danny's. reception staff let me leave my bags and check in later on, all staff i spoke to were lovely and very helpful. i stayed in a 7 bed en suite room, enough space, good lockers, big wardrobe to keep bags out of the way, lovely big bathroom and windows overlooking venice beach.  all very clean and tidy. "
Hungary,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed being here. this is the best place to go, i reccomend this one to everyone who is looking for sg cheap but still awesome place!"
Scotland,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,4,8,8,6,"the location couldn't have been better. you walk out the front door and you have everything. we even managed to go and see all the touristy things the city offers by booking a tour from the hostel. staff couldn't have been nicer, from the moment we got there we felt welcome. kitchen facilities were poor, only two camping stoves we could use but if you used them at the same time the fuse would blow. plenty cheap restaurants nearby though. "
Brazil,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,6,6,8,6,6,"i've spent only one night in this hostel but i can say that it's is located in na good beach. ar night, take care wen you go out out sit because there is a lot of homeless."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,8,8,10,stayed here for 5 nights. the location is great. 100 yards to the beach but there are a lots of tourists around with tacky shops. great bars though. very close to santa monica and venice canals. met loads of cool people. no breakfast included though and for the price you are paying you would exspect that.
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great location next to beach, in cool area. helpful staff, good facilities. i recommend it"
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"loud, but nice"
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,great place.  abby and staff deserve a raise.u.s. citizens  should need only a picture/photo driver license in place of  a passport  when already in the country to begin with.
Norway,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great location, just by the beach. had a room with great view over venice beach and the ocean. nice, clean rooms, same with bathroom, hot water. spacious lockers, nice staff. met people from all over the world - can recommend if staying at venice beach!"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"kitchen far too small, not much kitchen equipment..."
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,6,10,10,some staff were great and on the ball. others seemed stoned!     great place for solo travellers to meet others in the common room
Belgium,MixedGroup,31-40,6.6,6,6,6,4,8,8,8,- only two showers and toilets on our floor (toilet in the bathroom so you can't go to the toilet if someone is showering)  - loud music during night at the reception
Singapore,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,10,6,needs to update on the available parking area. the place the hostel recommended to park overnight says that it will tow away cars for parking beyond midnight.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,10,8,"fun hostel and was easy to meet other travellers. great location right by the beach and in the middle of shops, etc. too expensive for what you get though as i was paying $47 a night in a dorm."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.4,6,4,10,8,10,4,10,"staff is super great! all very nice, warm and friendly... however the other travelers we encountered weren't quite as nice. small rooms with limited to no air movement made nights crazy hot. it's right beside the beach so we put up with it, would probably stay there again and pray that there's some personable travelers staying there. "
Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"been a pleasure staying there - staff very helpful getting you from venice to everything you want see.    evening activities offered and at local or near by venues (st. monica, etc)  - you get taken to local free events as well you would not know about otherwise.  day activities offered aswell but who needs them you are in venice"
Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"this place was incredible--really glad i stayed here. this area is truly unique and 1 of the most laid back places i've ever visited. all the people i met at the hostel were cool except some friends said 1 girl at the front desk seemed absolutely miserable 90 per cent of the time. i can't imagine they'd make that up, so i didn't think that was cool. aside from that, everything was awesome! everything was so fresh so clean. all samesun locations seem to be excellent facilities. great experience."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,great light filled dorm of 4 bunk beds was refreshing to find good solid beds too.  staff were great helpful and friendly the perfect place to arrive too straight from lax to get rid of your jet lag and take on the california vibe !  will recommend this hostel to friends for sure 
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a great time staying at samessun, great spot to bass your to la.."
SouthKorea,Female,31-40,7.4,8,6,10,6,6,8,8,the location was quite good. but the locker in the room was complicated. key part was so tiny i could'nt use.
Germany,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,10,6,"this hostel is perfect to meet and get to know young people.it is 30 seconds away from the beach and you will love it there for sure! they have events on every night, it is very clean, the stuff is very friendly and open. best hostel at venice!!!"
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this place. the staff is very friendly and helpful, the location is great and i had an awesome time. i can't wait until the next time i'm back in vb. "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,6,8,10,8,6,not bad..
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent hostel right on the beach. easy access from the airport and could find free street parking pretty easily. the staff was helpful and courteous. would definitely recommend to anyone and hope to stay again :)
Sweden,Female,31-40,6.3,6,8,8,4,6,6,6,"the front desk girl let me in, but she was very indifferent. not a good first impression. checked in and went to my room and was really looking forward to a a shower.no towel on the bed! went down to the girl at the front desk and she said i had to buy one! she could have told me that from the beginning.  the room was ok.the beds were hard. no breakfast. the place was clean though, and location good. i ended up checking out earlier and went to hi santa monica, way better! go there instead!"
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really loved the location of the hostel and the bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean. also, sara working the reception was really helpful in recommending me cheap places to eat and have a few beers. all in all i had a great time at your hostel"
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,clean. great staff.  great location
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,8,8,"we only stayed for a night, so i can't give the most comprehensive review, since we didn't even use the kitchen or common room. but, everything we did use was definitely up to our standards. we were in a four man dorm, it was nice, clean and spacious, and it had its own bathroom. the area wasn't too loud at night, so we got a good night's sleep. one lady in particular at the front desk was extremely nice, but all the staff we met were friendly. if we go back to venice beach, i'd stay there again"
Turkey,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the location of the hostel is perfect if you want to stay on venice. staff was pretty helpful and nice to us. the room was fine. if you are going with a car, there are lots of spots to park (not free though). i will definitely stay here again if i come back to venice beach."
France,Couple,25-30,5.7,2,6,8,2,8,8,6,"the price is clearly overrated! we were a couple staying in a private room and we had to pay for each head. total $140 per night for a very small, hot and loud room with minimal amenities. it is even more than most motels."
China,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was perfect- the staff were super friendly, location is great for people watching/bars/restaurants, met lots of cool people, room was clean and well maintained...it was the best hostel i've ever stayed in. definitely would come back if i ever visit venice beach again."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"good vibes, great location bit noisy but your staying on venice beach so that's part of the charm"
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,8,10,"great hostel! right on the doorstep of venice beach. the staff were friendly, nights out were provided and venice beach is really colorful and busy. i enjoyed my stay and had no complaints about the hostel."
Slovenia,Male,31-40,5.7,4,6,10,6,2,6,6,"we, mother and daughter, booked the chosen room/beds in 4-bed female dorm more than month before. and was total shock at arrival to the samesun when the receptionist told us that the booked beds were not available. he offered us one bed in 2nd and one bed in 3rd floor...! obvisously an irresponsible person made mistake at our costs. in addition, for solution we were suggested that we convince people to move somewhere else... completely unproffessional, we do not recommend this hostel!"
Norway,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"the hostel is located right on the venice boardwalk, which is perfect if you want to experience everything that venice has to offer. close to the beach and to lots of good, cheap eats (try cairo cowboy right across the street!). the staff (especially the night staff) is very friendly and helpful, and they arrange plenty of stuff for their guests to do. this hostel is definitely worth the money, and you're guaranteed to have a great time!"
England,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,great hostel - brilliant location right on venice beach with a good bar just downstairs under the hostel. great party vibe (there was when i was there on 4th july anyway!) the staff are very good and helpful and there are a few activities like bar crawls organised if you want to join in. very relaxed vibe though - no hard sell and most activities are free.  there are individual bathrooms which are generally clean. good communal area with a great view of the beach. would definitely recommend!
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,4,8,8,6,8,6,8,very very basic room for what we paid. 24hr desk service which was good as we checked in really late n checked out really early. good location very close to beach but lots of homeless people around - didn't feel very safe at times. lots of young people around n the staff do pub crawls etc - would be good for singles
Netherlands,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,6,8,10,it's a nice place to stay! great area and close to the beach  
England,Male,18-24,8,4,8,10,6,8,10,10,helpful staff and trendy location with nice shops and restaurants around. a bit overpriced though
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"we had a great stay, the location was great and all the staff w ere really cool."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great hostel, great location! staff really friendly "
Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,right on venice beach and clean. nice overall. the ambiance was average. the staff didn't really do much to get people to interact.
Norway,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,only one bathroom with no lock. not fun when you have to take a shower and someone comes in...
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place! only the one night but had an awesome time! great people, heaps to do!! super friendly staff.... highly recommend locking this place in "
Denmark,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great location. friendly staff who will help you with any sorts of problem. common-area is cozy with some couches, but should be bigger to fit all guests. events and shuttles to all over california directly from the hostel. i would recommend this place and am definitely coming back. "
Jamaica,Female,31-40,6.6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,great place to rest and shower not the place to bask in the lap of luxury. location stellar.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i on,y stayed one night but will definitely return if i go back to venice. the location is perfect, the 4 bed female dorm i stayed in was very clean, comfy beds, great wireless and a great common area that looks out over the beach."
Belgium,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,8,8,"the location is great! right at the beach (i could see the beach from my room). the guy at the reception was super nice and funny. he helps you with everything. the hostel makes it very easy to meet other people, you make new friends very quickly."
England,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"hostel is right on the beach so you shall want for nothing as all main bars and restaurants are within walking distance. we were in a 4 person dorm which was standard double beds with lockers in and there are multiple showers dotted throughout the corridors so that was never ran issue. staff were really helpful when needed and there were good people to talk to, if thou are staying in venice beach then this is all the hostel you'll need."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8,6,6,10,8,10,8,8,"right on the beach so location spot on, only stayed a night but was nice what l saw"
England,Couple,25-30,6.3,4,6,8,6,8,6,6,"generally good. our first room was an 8 bed which was cramped, dark and stuffy, subsequent 7 and 4 bed dorms were much nicer though. the lack of onsite laundry facilities is a pretty big omission, we had to go to a laundrette about a mile away."
Australia,Couple,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"we stayed in a private double room with shared bathroom - it had a good tv and a bar fridge and was on the same floor as the kitchen and common room. we were very impressed with the staff, cooking facilities and consideration shown by other guests. the 733 rapid bus to downtown is only two blocks away. a very cheap way to get to the greyhound bus station ($1.50)."
Australia,Male,,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,the booking for my second night was not seen at samesun hostel so when i came back from disney world at 11pm i had no where to sleep.  thankfully the assistant at samesun hostel sorted it out and upgraded my ro
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great great place to stay. reasonably priced, right in the heart of the venice beach boardwalk. it's not too big, so it's easy to mingle with other travellers too and make new friends."
Argentina,Couple,25-30,8,6,10,10,8,8,8,6,se had a todo stay. location was perfect. we had a prívate room and it was very good. the bed could had been better but it was fine.
England,Couple,18-24,6,6,8,8,4,6,4,6,cramped dorm and disappointing communal area. staff were obliging but not especially friendly. good security for a mixed area - near the beach but not much else (although thats standard for la) not much to write home about but does the job. 
Australia,Female,18-24,8,6,6,10,8,10,8,8,great staff -  great location - cool people. venice's best location
Canada,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome staff and super friendly service. only improvement they could make is having a laundry facility on site but there are some about 15-20 minute walk away. the group pub outings should cater more towards budget minded travellers...it is a hostel after all.
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"we stayed on the top floor in a private room at this hostel. it was all clean and tidy, staff where nice. id say it was a clean nice basic hostel, no bar or anything like that, although there is a bar right next door. the only bad thing i would say is on the top floor while i was there the wifi would drop in and out all of the time. but overall a nice place to stay."
France,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. we had a room of 4 with a very nice view on the beach :)  the bathroom was clean, the kitchen is big and convenient, the common room is nice.  it's a great location if you wanna go to the beach. i definitly recomand this hostel."
England,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,4,8,10,8,8,"right next to venice beach (and all the homeless people that sleep there), above a reasonably good bar/restaurant, but very far from the centre of la. expect a 1.5 - 2 hour multiple bus journey to get to hollywood boulevard. 24 hour, friendly staff and a good size kitchen."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing experience got to meet some great people
Russia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"i just came back from my vacation, it was awsome! i spend 11 days at samesun hostel in venice beach, i ve met a really nice roommates there and i hope that we will keep in touch. this hostel is may be the only one which is so close to the beach, facing the ocean.   if you go surfing just grab your surfboard and go its 3 min, surf, bicycle and skateboard rent is at the next door with 10% discount for those who stay in samesun.   also there is a nice bar with good sandwiches and live music downstair"
Slovenia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very good location, big, clean rooms and very friendly and helpful stuff (especially ricky!). the hostel is located in venice beach so it's easy to go around. you can also take the bus. there's no breakfast and the kitchen is kind of small, but they also have big common room, where you can hang out with others. i suggest this hostel to everyone!"
France,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"good stay here, the place is clean, you can't have a better location an aby (or amy) and chris are awesome! thank you guys for your cheerfulness ;-) it's a pity there is no breakfast and no lockers."
Belgium,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've been going to this hostel for years now, back in the days when it was called venice beach cotel , but i have to say   since then it only got better now, it's even more cleaner then before , service is awesome as usual and they have free wifi which they didn't have before .  so , if you wanna stay in los angeles , go to samesun venice beach"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,4,6,10,4,6,6,8,location was great but they didn't have any lockers and only has 4 toilets/shower
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,6,10,"nice clean hostel, location is great. showers were often out of hot water. the hostel really needs a bigger social area. people tended to sit in their rooms too much."
Brazil,Couple,25-30,6,6,6,10,4,6,4,6,the place is really tacky but its very well located. it's kinda old too. don't expect a real hostel experience because the atmosphere for interaction with other people just doesn't happend there. it's a good price for a perfect location and a clean room. nothing more than that. i would advise couples to go some place else.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,excellent location and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. a must stay if in la
NewZealand,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,6,6,6,8,"the room we booked was not the room we were given, not impressed!"
Spain,Male,25-30,5.1,4,8,8,4,6,4,2,"creepy, noisy! dirty, 1 shower for the entire floor....... don't go. i've been in hundreds of hostels around the world and this is one of the worst by far"
France,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,available team  friendly atmosphere  clean room  perfect place  just some problems to book room
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,8,6,very uncomplicated stay and staff were friendly most of the time. good that outside guests are not allowed in the hostel given the location. full sized lockers for bags in the rooms would be a useful addition especially in dorms.
Japan,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,6,10,8,8,staff there were kind to me. i want to stay here again!
England,Male,41+,8,6,10,10,6,10,6,8,always a good option when in la
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"staff were super helpful and you cannot beat the location, 30 seconds walk to the beach. common areas were quite small apart from that this place is great! highly recommended."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the hostel doesn't have laundry, if you need one you need to take a bus or walk almost 25 minutes."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"brilliant stay, perfect location, helpful staff. clean room, good facilities and again the location is absolutely perfect. lockers in rooms and a very secure front entrance, brilliant overall!"
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,4,8,8,6,10,hostel is ok just if you have to sleep and anything else
Germany,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,8,4,6,8,we arrived late and checked-out very soon next day. so we didn't see a lot of the hostels. double room was very small and old. staff seemed not to be very motivated. but the location is just great to hang out at the beach.
Taiwan,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,no 2 bad!!
USA,Couple,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,4,6,6,4,the only thing great about samesun is it's location as you are literally on the boardwalk all hotels in the area are expensive and even some of the hostels are more that what you'd pay on average. but i believe that's how this hostel gets you; they take advantage of kids traveling on a budget and therefore assume you don't expect much. i've stayed in hostels all over the world and i am actually surprised at how high the rating is at this one. also- americans: don't forget your passport!
Ireland,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,8,10,great location and friendly staff
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.4,6,6,8,4,6,4,4,"room smelled badly, not really clean, dark (just small window), bathroom not clean"
Spain,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,4,8,6,8,the hostel isn't finished yet. will be good once they set it up.
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,6,8,10,6,i loved it!
NewZealand,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"it was in a good location, right on venice beach. area seemed a little dodgy at night but day time was good. staff were friendly and helpful. the limo experience was fun and well worth $40. the beds were pretty comfy but the blankets were thin and one that i was given was so old it felt like an old towel, so was quite cold most nights. other than that great hostel :)"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i met lots of cool people here. it was secure and comfortable.

Brazil,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,the holstel could have restrooms inside the bedroom.
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"we realy enjoyed our stay at the samesun in venice. i have stayed in many samesuns and there always great  (vancouver, banff, revalstoke) the staff are always helpful and there is always fun to be had if your looking for it. the bathrooms were private witch was nice and they were kept very clean, they could get a little busy in the morning as there was only two on each floor. they have the best location right in the centre of venice beach."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"samesun delivers again, awesome hostel. awesome location right in the heart of venice beach. security is great but it does also mean you cant have guests in the hostel which sucks a bit."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay here! very friendly, and informative staff."
Spain,Male,25-30,8,8,4,8,8,10,10,8,great value for money!  but the lockers were missing..
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a lot of fun at this hostel and met some great people.  loved the location being so close to the beach.  awesome staff who helped me plan my days to the max.  will be back for sure!
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is awesome!  great location, a stones throw away from the beach.  great, friendly staff that are very helpful.  could not have asked for a better place to stay.  will definitely be back."
Denmark,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"the location is really awesome - near the beach and close to restaurants and bars. the staff was very cool and friendly. could have used a private bathroom, but everything was nice and clean! will definitely stay there again of i'm ever in la again + recommend it to others"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the experience was fantastic. you are right at the beach, and within walking distance (200 meters) of many charming little restaurant s and bars. the staff glowed with positive, helpful energy, and took a personal interest in every person who came to the front desk. the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. the guests were kind and not scary.   i can't  adequately express how pleased i am with my experience of samesun venice beach. keep up the great work!"
Japan,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"so international! i met guys from america, italy, german, new zealand, australia, canada, hungary, switzerland, britain, and finland. i am sure you will have a special experience. if i have a chance again, i will definitely stay at the hostel."
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.7,6,10,10,6,10,6,6,my boyfriend and i stayed for 3 nights in the 3 bedroom dorm! it was a good size and had a tv! the main problem was it smelt like sewerage. i didn't complain at the time as i didn't want to whinge but just warning others not to book that room! also two out of the three beds were terrible they sounded like they were going to fall apart everytime someone moved and the springs were all poking out! luckily i got the comfy bed but my poor boyfriend had a hard time! all round it's an ok hostel!
England,Male,18-24,6.6,6,10,10,2,10,4,4,"samesun is a funny little hostel, it's quirky and weird. i stayed in a 7bed dorm with en-suite. the bed was okay and had clean sheets. the bathroom was clean but the shower only seemed to have a fixed temp of 'cool'. the hostel could of definatley been better organised as they could handle many check-in's, but they did say they had just got a new system. it's in a prime location next to the broadwalk but also next to all the prime weirdo's from venice, but they have a good security door."
England,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great location, and although we could understand why some people felt uncomfortable due to the homeless people, the area actually felt pretty safe to us. room was great, maids are always around so you know it's clean! although we didn't take part as i was under 21,a lot of the activities such as a club night in hollywood seemed like a good idea :) free wifi was a big bonus. tip if you want to rent a bike go to the one right next to the hostel and tell them you're staying there for a discount!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay when in venice beach. short walk/bike ride to santa monica. staff friendly &amp; very helpful. definitely will be back!!
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,8,"a large hostel but very clean.  if you like venice this is the perfect location.  many people will not like the area venice.  no breakfast :(    this location is right on the beach, you can't get closer.  also be sure to ask for a basketball and shoot some hoops at venice beach."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,10,6,8,8,8,10,8,"second time i have stayed here and i loved it just as much. it is right on the beach and a short bus trip to santa monica. venice beach is an extremely vibrant area, but it is an 40 minute or so bus trip into hollywood blvd. the buses a fairly regular and cost very little. the hostel itself wasn't rowdy at all and provided a great place to sleep."
Denmark,Male,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,6,6,10,"hard beds, hot water runs out to quick, 4 people in a room can't take a hot shower after each other since hot water runs out.  good location though, and safe.."
Australia,Male,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,2,8,8,2,"i was bitten by bed bugs and in my four days there, was lucky enough to get only one hot shower. all other showers were either cold or luke warm."
HongKong,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i like the atmosphere in the hostel, people are so nice here, and we can have our valuables deposited. however, the light in the room is a little bit too dim, at least for the room that i stayed in."
Germany,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is wonderful. i enjoyed my time there very much. the manager mrs. sara is a wonderful person, and she make all time the right decissions. her team is very friendly. it is super clean everywhere in the house.  i like to come back and recommend this place to stay !!!!"
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,8,6,pros : it's close to a beautiful beach  it's cheap    cons: smell in the room  no lockers  no bike parking  no breakfast  very few showers
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"top location, friendly staff, great atmosphere. can't wait to go back!"
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location, friendly staff and weekend pub crawls were awesome."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,the location was sickkkkkkk. also close to the beach and heaps of vegan restaurants
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,4,8,8,8,10,"the hostel was excellent, the staff were nice, the facilities were very good. the only problem was the location. venice beach at night is terrible, there is nothing to do, too many homeless people and you don't feel safe walking around there at night. moreover, public transport to other places takes too long."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"cool place, good location, good staff."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location and friendly, helpful staff"
Australia,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this was a terrible hostel on many levels, recommend anywhere but here"
France,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"brillant stay at venice cotel so well located!ambiance is brillant, should have staid longer...pub crawling is cool too and staff very friendly as well. only problem is no laundries but appart from that everyhing is perfect!    loved the aussies there, holy if you read me mizou@outlook.com"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,good value hostel. everything you need and literally steps from the sand. there wasn't much of an atmosphere in the hostel but they do nights out and group activities
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,10,6,4,4,6,"the staff were not friendly at all, except for one girl when i arrived she helped me find my credit card. management of a small situation was dealt with poorly, a staff member came storming into the room at 1030pm demanding a lady get out of the bottom bunk as it had supposedly been reserved. just was very rude."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"great place to stay on the beach, chilled vibe, couldn't really ask for more .. maybe less aussies ! haha"
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel is the best i've ever been its clean and nice and the stuff is awesome. don't forget this amazing place!! i defiantly coming back and i just can recommend it to everyone who love the beach and awesome people.
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,10,6,6,10,8,8,"this hostel is great the staff are super friendly and helpful. the hostel is located right on the venice boardwalk right near the venice sign. i didn't feel safe walking around at night in this area but if your into surfing and the whole beach lifestyle its perfect. the only issues with the hostel is that there is no elevator so i had to drag two huge suitcases up 3 flights of stairs, but other than that a great place to stay. venice is far from everything i would suggest hiring a car."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,10,6,8,10,"the hostel was clean and well located and most of the staff were friendly and very helpful, apart from one blonde woman who was incredibly unfriendly and unhelpful."
Germany,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i stayed in the cotel for three nights and really liked it. the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was clean and the view on the beach is priceless! the hostel is in a great location if you like to stay at the beach. venice beach is awesome!  i would definitely come back. :-)"
Norway,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"had a lovely stay at venice beach cotel!! the staff was great, it was clean and not too expensive. i absolutely loved every minute of my stay here, will be back for sure!!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,it was awesome as usual and i didn't want to leave.. hope i'll be back there again next year :)
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is incredible!   we lobbed in from oz after a 18-hour flight &amp; were so happy we found this place!  its right on the beach, just 100m from muscle beach. you can walk along the beach down to santa monica   the staff wer all great, especially nikki!!  they even organised some of the other people to have a little get together, we watched lakers game on the tv &amp; had a few drinks &amp; then they took us out to a local bar.   we will be going back!  its a $13pp shuttle or 2 busses from lax"
France,Male,18-24,8,8,4,10,8,8,8,10,staff was great even new staff but some look bored so dnt smile and you feel they re rude when they re not rooms are huge n clean so its cool n the location is the best one in venise i think luggage room was open all time just should be locker but in average its the spot
USA,Male,25-30,6,4,6,10,6,4,6,6,"i booked a spot but was not allowed to check in because i was not carrying my passport. i was on vacation with no intention of leaving the country, i had my drivers license, my plane ticket stubs, and other information to prove i was a valid traveler, but they unapologetically turned me down at 10:30 p.m. then got impatient when i asked about hotels near by. i asked if i could use their internet to book somewhere else. ""no."" i was turned out onto the street, late, and charged a booking fee."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"dont put ""free parking"" on the website unless you actually have parking.  finding parking on the street was really hard and a real detriment from me staying longer."
France,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"just stayed one night (thursday), clean, good staff, they take you to the closest bar in the proximity with the other traveller of the hostel, good way to meet people and have good time."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"amazing location within steps of the beach, great weather which made the stay even better and there bunk beds were pretty good to."
Norway,Female,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,2,4,10,"well.. im not the one that normally complain easily.. im usually satisfied as long as people are happy and nice..the staff seriously needs to be changed, never seen so grumpy mood!! dont ask twice, if u dont hear them!!  the location is great , right at the beach! really nice suring the day!.. but..! as soon as it gets dark..do not go alone anywhere!!! specially girls alone!! 3 episodes with guys while i was there! sooo many crazy people there!!  kitchen closes at 12pm, and not open before 8am."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,6,10,10,6,10,8,6,"definitely needs more bathrooms, or at least detached toilets. two per floor is insufficient!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,i only stayed one night but they had a very smooth and well operated hostel going here. the room was 4 bed dorm and was the cleanest i've ever stayed in. so was the bathroom. there was a shared kitchen with all facilities needed to cook and store your stuff. this hostel i would recommend for sure. as the location is fit on venice beach and security is very good.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, very clean, nice rooms with nice bunks. best location!!"
USA,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,"very nice place and great staff. quick to check in and check out, and very close to bus stop that'll get you all around la. simple and hassle-free place to stay :)"
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel experience i have ever had!
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,8,8,10,8,8,had a very nice time at the venice beach cotel. the staffs were very nice and i felt safe. one bad point is that they just open the community room at 8 pm and close it at 11 pm.
France,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,6,8,8,10,"this hostel is really good, the location is amazing!!  but the kitchen is ridiculous, you have just two hotplates and you need 30 minutes  to boil your water... it's hotplate for camping!"
Canada,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"great location, good security at the front door but no lockers if that worries you. 24 reception."
England,Female,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,6,2,4,8,"great location but that's it! one of the worst hostels i've ever stayed in. no air conditioning in the room, was like a sauna! expensive for a hostel considering kitchen was so basic, no proper cooker! there's no free parking, they are reffering to residents parking on the road 10 minute walk away which you have to compete for during street cleaning days. all our fresh food got thrown away in the fridge even tho it was labelled, staff were rude didn't even apoligise. find somewhere else."
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,perfect location and very friemdly staff!  my favourite place i've stayed in calafornia.
Slovakia,Male,18-24,7.1,6,4,10,8,8,6,8,"it was a nice clean hostel. they were changing sheets and towels everyday, but there were no lockers in the rooms, and no breakfast included. the location was really good, just next to the beach, but the price is still bigger then what you get."
Germany,Female,25-30,3.4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,"no aircondition and no windows, i felt like in prison or even worse."
England,Male,31-40,7.1,4,6,10,6,10,8,6,check out the front desk for the social events.
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved the fact that i was there alone but felt tike i wasn't. the group activities at night that's a perfect option to meet people and have  fun!
Australia,Male,31-40,3.4,2,6,2,2,4,6,2,was not happy with that place
Brazil,Female,25-30,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,"i had booked a bed in a women's room when i arrived there i received a key for a mixed room. the girl that works in the front desk was worried about our insatisfaction, so, she gaved us a upgrad (free) to stay in a room only with women. it was very good for us. another point is that you need to climb 2 flights of stairs, which complicates because we had 2 pieces of luggage, each person. it was good because i stayed only during 1 night. next time i'll prefer book a hostel in santa monica."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,this is the best location you can find in venice beach!!! we could see the ocean from our room. what more can you ask for? also the staff was so nice. thanks abby!!! you made my night!
Canada,Couple,18-24,6.3,4,8,10,4,8,6,4,"very hot inside, hear all the noise outside, lots of parking nearby which is good and free parking close by."
Brazil,Male,25-30,6,4,8,8,4,6,6,6,"the location is great if you want to enjoy the beach, but if you're looking for nightclubs and pubs, during the week the region is calm by the night. this is not a party hostel."
Canada,Male,31-40,6.9,6,6,10,4,10,4,8,"very helpful, great staff and location.  free street parking.  let down by poor character &amp; atmosphere at hostel.  no locker in my room either, but at least staff have to buzz in guests manually each time.  no a/c as well, room was very warm.  lounge is teeny tiny and cramped.  hostel is super simple, with so many rooms and just two bathrooms per floor.  i won't stay again.  no fun at all.  no place to chill out except in computer room &amp; kitchen.  not very welcoming vibe.  bland and sterile."
Germany,Female,25-30,6,2,6,10,6,8,6,4,"no breakfast, to expensive, dirty bathrooms, but located directly on the beach"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,great place to stay with an amazing location.. the staff were fantastic. can i suggest lockers in the rooms please??
Germany,Male,31-40,6,2,6,10,6,8,4,6,great location but regarding the too hot room with window to a funnel a somehow absurd value for the money
USA,Female,41+,6.9,6,6,8,8,6,6,8,"two of the three staff i encountered we're great; made me feel welcomed and safe, but the one person seems kind of grumpy and spoiled it for the rest of the staff, in terms i my rating. but i had a good stay and the gal who was cleaning really seemed to keep the place looking clean -in spite of the condition of what she was working with."
France,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,4,8,6,8,"very nice hostel with a good location.  however, only 2 showers by floor is far from being enough ! and the common room is a bit too small to rally people there."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,6,6,10,10,having a lounge that is accessible at any hour (even after people have left to go waste their money at the bar) would be appreciated.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"clean. excellent location right on beach boardwalk, close to shops skate park and surf. friendly staff."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was great, on the beach, the staff were really nice and always helpful"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,4,10,10,10,"great hostel, brilliant location, helpful staff . besides the limited bathrooms and no accon in dorms. it is an awesome hostel."
Belgium,Male,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,great place to party and to meet new friends. also surprisingly quiet at night. best of both worlds. staff is awesome. they even paid for my taxi to the airport when the shuttle company lost my reservation! would definitely go back. remind me to bring chokotoffs!
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"fun place to stay right in the middle of venice beach. nice and clean, and the staff were great."
Belgium,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"awesom stay, loved every minute of it ! great location, great staff, great people to make the best atmosphere ever! thanks! best part : evening activities permitting everyone to meat! place to recommend!!!!!"
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,8,8,8,10,10,"the hostel was really good, nice rooms, nice bathroom and clean kitchen. the staff organized a pizza night and then we all went aout to a bar a few blocks away.   the only issue was the price (almost 50 bucks). i've been in many hostels for the half of the money and much better facilities, location &amp; breakfast. anyway, still recommend it.   btw, is the one in the corner of venice with the beach, there is another venice hostel one block before that is horrible."
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,6,8,8,6,best location for seeing the freaks on venice beach good hostel over all. they have a bar that serves you your own beer! a nice touch
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,i had a great time there but there are limited toilets and showers which is annoying
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i was pleseantly surprised. this is a fantastic hostel, although i had some doubts about the location, it was a lot quieter than i thought (though i wasnt there over a weekend. it is a long way from most of the major la attractions though, be warned it takes at least an hour to get downtown or to hollywood form venice. if that doesn't bother you, then this hostel is great value for money!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was amazing,. all the staff were very helpful, had a great party vibe. the room was very clean and the bathrooms were in great condition. i would go and stay there again. was the best hostel i have stayed at in the states. met alot of nice travellers there and hang out with them. :)"
France,Male,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,10,8,everything was perfect!
Belgium,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,8,4,really good athmosphere. perfect for young poeple
Australia,Male,18-24,4.3,4,8,8,2,4,2,2,"where to start... the hostel is in a decent spot of you want to stay at venice beach, but don't its really more of a day trip thing it's dirty, unsafe, but touristy. the hostel itself is dirty and very tired, the place is falling apart and desperately needs a/c, you can get by with the window open but you have to close it at night since its so loud outside with the club next to it. also this hostel has no culture, in short it's boring... since its boring and falling apart it really has nothing!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,6,8,"great location, the staff were nice, and the dorm was fine."
Sweden,AllMaleGroup,31-40,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,6,8,"i don't really have anything to complain about, except maybe that it's a bit far from central la, but that's sort of implied if you choose to stay in venice beach..."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,8,6,great stay. kerry and abbey were spot on hosts. place was kept clean and the hostel activities were fun and enjoyable.
Turkey,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,2,10,10,8,staff is so friendly and helped to everything. there is no elevator so it was a problem and facilities are old. but its really good hostel. you have to choose that one !
Germany,Male,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the venice beach cotel is in almost every category a very good hostel. they have events every evening, the stuff is very good and it's easy to meet people. only a few more bathrooms and a cheaper rate or included breakfast wouldn't hurt. but besides that i can really recommend it and the location is just insanely good."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay here. great location and friendly staff. the dorms are pretty basic but clean and decent facilities.
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,i liked the room. it was nice and clean. the bathroom was new.

Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,i freakin loved venice beach and the hostel was so close. the hostel is also pretty nice but a bit expensive ;)
England,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"the location of this hostel is fantastic! clean room, friendly staff and a good atmosphere. a few more shared bathrooms wouldnt go a miss, but other than that was great."
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best place to stay in venice!!!!!   * amazing staff and good location : )    thanks guys    duda
Ireland,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,8,6,6,8,the kitchen was very small and very basic along with common area. the bathrooms were nice and bedrooms however more bathrooms needed. reception staff at times on the verge of being rude to their paying customers however some were helpfully. free library very nice touch. location makes up for everything.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"nick and i had the best time at venice beach cotel.   the staff were amazing, so helpful and abby was an absolute star! such a good experience and we will be back to stay there in the near future!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,4,8,8,8,they need a reform in the bedrooms infrastructure… bad mattresses and lockers and windows… the rest of it is very ok!
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"only stayed one night on my way back to the uk from nz -- loacted dead near to the beach, you really couldn't ask for a better location. was rather quiet when i was there, so no problems with noise. seemed a good place to meet other travellers. staff were friendly, facilities were clean, etc.    worth staying at!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fun and friendly
Sweden,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,great fun! a real party hostel!
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great hostel, in the best location ever, right on the beach. our dorm window looked right onto the beach and all the happenings on the street. super cool."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,6,8,8,10,"great location right on the front walk, well organized and clean. not exactly cheap but worth the money"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. great location. great staff. clean towels every day. guest night outs every night. could not recommend more highly.
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,10,6,"excellent location &amp; super fun staff. two friends &amp; i stayed here in a three person private room - which was a double bed &amp; the third one of us was on a pretty dingy stretcher bed.  together with a whole lot of other guests &amp; a lovely girl from the hostel named dora, had a crazy fun night out on the town. the place has top security too and almost right on the beach."
England,Female,31-40,5.4,4,8,4,2,8,6,6,"it was very tatty but clean, the double bed was very small- all that was bearable but the noise coming from the hostel's heating/air conditioning machine was unbearable- it went on all night, droning far too loud to be healthy- we should have made some more fuss and got a refund."
Australia,Couple,18-24,6.3,4,10,8,4,6,6,6,"the public transport is very convient in the area. we could catch a bus to santa monia which was a beautiful town, or a bus to beverly hills and hollywood easily. the public bus to the airport is only 15 mins away and you can catch a local blue or green bus to that very cheaply. the location was really the only reason we stayed here and other than that we didn't see a whole lot to do in the area. the best thing was the great pub and resturant downstairs. it had cheap food and live music."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"helpful staff, clean bathroom, excellent location. room smelt a little strange and the bed was a little uncomfortable but for the price it was fine. it would have been nice if the kitchen opened earlier, the day we left we couldn't eat breakfast because the 'kitchen was closed' and from what we could tell that meant the door stayed closed 'just because', a little annoying."
Scotland,Female,25-30,7.4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,"venice beach cotel is a charming hostel-cum-hotel. we stayed in a private room and were very comfortable. price is very high, but unfortunately this is normal for the venice beach area, and the distinguishing factor for us was access to a kitchen, which is clean and well-kept (although the electric hobs did not work amazingly well). venice beach itself is definitely one of the nicer and more interesting places to stay in the la area, so also recommend the cotel for that too."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"stayed in a private room with two friends. room was clean and so was shared bathroom. excellent location! couldn't have asked for a better spot, especially for that price!!! staff was helpful and friendly!"
China,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,8,10,10,"very good, near the beach"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a big thank you to the lovely venice beach cotel for showing us such a good time!!  had a dorm room with a view of the ocean and a restroom that was always clean.  unbeatable location on the beach, so many things to see and do.  the staff were so accommodating and friendly, we had a great night out with abby and some of the other guests.  we will be back!"
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,its right next to a really beautiful beach. after hearing some of the reviews i was really worried that this place was going to be horrible. even my taxi driver was trying to talk me out of going here. i have no idea why. the room was clean and i only had to share a bathroom with two other people. it was also near a good selection of food and cafes.
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"awesome staff and awesome spot. i would like to see more recycling there though. the communal shopping baskets are a great idea, but eco bags are probably more convenient. cheers"
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"we stayed for 2 nights in february 2012. we arrived at about 8am and were told we could check in which was great. we were also given a free upgrade to a room with a view. the room was basic but ok, the bed however was very sqeaky and there was a constant dripping noise in the room. the staff were all friendly and we had a a great night around a few local bars with joe. for the price we would stay again as the area is pretty cool."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,extremely happy with my stay. a lot of character in a great location..the hostel had a very cali feel about it. the staff were very friendly and the rooms were more then comfortable. highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good time and to meet new people
Brazil,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,6,6,10,10,6,all the staff was amazing! we had a great time because of them!
Denmark,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,8,8,10,"rally cool hostel with friendly staff, great location and a check-out @ 12pm which is awesome.   all in all an awesome place."
Denmark,Male,25-30,6.9,6,10,10,6,6,6,4,it smelled like pee in our room - it might be a strange cleaning product !?
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.7,6,6,8,6,10,8,10,"i didn't feel safe to to go out of the hostel at night. during the day, location is perfect. even to use wi-fi internet you have to pay- first hostel i stay  that charges for this. good overall"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"staff was very helpfull at all times requested. location is cool, in front of the beach! but, depending on the day, there are not too much stuff to do around."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,8,8,10,10,10,"excellent place to stay, nice and helpfull guys on staff, excellent location, just some steps from beach"
Norway,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.1,4,8,8,2,4,4,6,"staff were not very helpful, nor were they happy or nice. our room was dirty, bathroom was dirty and even though the webpage said that the hostel had blow driers, there weren't any the first night. our room was freezing cold because of the airconditioning, which was impossible to turn off. we had only sheets and a thin, brown blanket so we all got sick after the first night. there was also a very annoying sound coming from the window. not going back, ever."
Australia,Male,18-24,5.7,4,8,10,2,6,4,6,room smelt like babies nappies
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"i cannot speak highly enough of the cotel. right on the beach, ocean view, in a beautiful building with murals on both sides. the staff was friendly, helpful, and really made me as a first time hostel visitor feel totally comfortable. facilities were great, atmosphere invited meeting other guests and hanging out. totally changed my mind about what a hostel could be. have to mention the staff one more time, young, hip, and helpful. you must try this place!"
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"i was only there for one night, but it was great. the staff helped me arrange shuttles to the airport. the location was perfect to walk along the beach and along the boardwalk. i felt safe, the bathrooms were clean, and i was lucky enough to get great roommates in my room. i will definitely stay there next time i'm in venice. :)"
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,if you want to stay in venice beach this is the place to go.
Ireland,Female,25-30,5.1,2,6,6,6,6,4,6,"i only stayed at the venice beach cotel for one night but i was not at all impressed. i have no comments on the activities etc as i wasn't there for long enough to take part. my issue came from the room itself. i spent a month travelling through the us and the bed in venice beach was the most uncomfortable of my trip. i could feel the springs all night long. the dorm also seemed to have no source of heat and when i woke up at 1am freezing, the thin blanket provided was just no sufficient."
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i've been so far.
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome hostel in the best location ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"pricey due to location, but a good hostel nonetheless. clean, secure and places to sit and relax."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"this hostel looks like a lot of fun but it's actually a little bit bland, not bad really but then there doesn't seem to be much to choose from in la! the rooms are a good size, not quite enough bathrooms, staff are nice and good to chat to! venice beach is hilarious but not the safest if you're travelling alone, as a girl on my own didn't feel safe to do so after dark. met a really nice homeless guy called mike though!"
Germany,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,8,6,"we had a great time there and have been well supported by excellent, friendly staff!"

Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a great time at the cotel - staff on the front desk were awesome. venice beach is such a great place, would definitely stay in the cotel in an instant. thanks."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"if your heading to la then venice beach cotel is the place to be. the location is a good spot to base yourself with hollywood and beverly hills not to far away(everything is far away from each other in la). you can rent yourself a bike or longboard for the day and cruise the beach path all the way to santa monica, which is another amazing part of la. all the staff were unreal, going above and beyond to make their guests feel at home. i'd go straight back next time i'm there."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,8,10,10,10,staff were welcoming and threw a party for the festive season.  good location and staff  helpful in assisting you to get around.
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"really good place, only downside is there is no free wifi/internet."
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,enjoyed my stay overall.  the staff was good and fun and the location right on the boardwalk was great. the only complaint i had was having to pay for internet.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,6,10,8,6,8,8,10,clean bathrooms and great security. what more can you ask for. thanks : )
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"great stay. ideal location right by venice beach. good atmosphere in the evenings with kerry and the staff drinking with you in the lounge. would stay here again for sure. rich, england"

Norway,Couple,18-24,7.1,6,10,8,6,6,6,8,"a nice place to stay if you like to live on the beach, also close to santa monica and the airport. just be aware that going to the city is either very expensive with taxi, or takes a long time with bus (at least one hour with a transfer). clean toilet/shower and common area. one big drawback is the expensive wifi access, and a bit far to closest supermarket."
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,only negative was that there were no individual lockers in the rooms.
Australia,MixedGroup,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,geat viiew of the beach from our triple room window. soclose to venice beach.
Norway,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,"overall the venice beach cotel was a fun environment. it is only steps away from the beach and boardwalk. the bus line to take you to downtown la or santa monica is only a few blocks walk from the hostel. there is a great restaurant bar below called danny's with live bands in the evening. the employees are friendly and welcoming as well as knowledgeable of the area. security is great as well, although there are not individual lockers to put your things in. i was impressed by the cleanliness."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,good hostel. expensive (but that is more a la thing). staff were very friendly and helpful which is most important.
Taiwan,Female,41+,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,6,10,"the transportation information about bus is not correct, no free internet computer. the stuff is not clear how to transfter from venice to san fransico,  unlike s,f hostell   can order shuttle for us very passion. but i think they are still nice   if they could provide breakfast, that will be welcomed"
Denmark,Female,31-40,6.3,6,6,10,6,6,4,6,"the hostel is in a very good location right on the beach and by venice board walk, the hostel in itself is very average nothing fancy, could do with a good make over, view from my room was a wall, the bed was okay and good space in the room, the blanket felt a bit dirty. location was great, the rest was average. staff was friendly and helpful with transportation info. i could stay here again."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"the stuffs are really friendly and helpful. as i only stayed one night, i can't give other comments."
England,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this hostel was amazing! i read reviews to say it was great and it truly was. i traveled  my own and i felt so comfortable. i had problems with my shuttle from the airport so i called the  hostel and they were straight onto it, they helped me with every question. it was a great location i had a beautiful view of the beach. you get clean sheets everyday. security is great as they only let peope who are staying at the hostel in so you never get randoms, was a great place. x"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel. lovely staff. great location!
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel! staff were exceptional. my advise if your going in the winter months go over a weekend. you won't regret it
Australia,Male,18-24,8.7,0,6,8,0,10,10,8,"great party hostel. everyone there, looking to have a good time. being in venice means you are out the hussle ad bussle and down near the beach. means buses into hollywood and stuff take over an hour but it's much better being able to escape to the beach"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"the owner was soo friendly! she invited us to party with her, and let us pay separately. the hostel was in a great location with awesome ocean views. 5 stars."
USA,Male,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great location in an historic building directly on the beach. the manager is fabulous, fun and friendly, great atmosphere. highly recommend! thanks!  christian"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,8,10,staff were fantastic.  very helpful bunch and lots of fun. would definitely recommend!
Germany,Male,31-40,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,8,8,"good location, easily accessble by public bus (30min) which is cheaper than offered shuttle service ($2.50). rooms are ok and clean, some offer ""free"" wifi from the below pub."
USA,Female,25-30,7,0,8,10,0,10,8,4,"the staff was extremely nice and personable, but sadly that didn't quite make up for the lack of cleanliness or the overwhelming feeling that something bad had happened in our room years before we got there.  it's a great location, but i don't think i would stay here again."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"the location is really priceless, the staff at the reception were really nice and helpful. they were very accommodating as i arrived too early for my check-in and asked to store luggage, get a towel and call a shuttle for a friend who was not staying in the hostel. if you are looking for a guided tour of l.a., i would not recommend the one that they offer you in the hostel (at least not the one l.a. by night). it is not the hostel's fault though! the company offering the tourjust wasn't too good"
Belgium,Female,41+,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"the whole place could have done with a fresh coat of paint, but it was clean, cheap and friendly. plus the women's dorm i was staying in had a beautiful sea view!"
Australia,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,fantastic staff / great location - perfect a+++
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"the staff were very friendly and keen to help. the area seems intimidating when you first get there, but is actually quite safe and wonderful to watch. the atmosphere on the beac was just amazing. there is also cheap transportation. dry close by, although it does take almost 40 minutes to get into hollywood."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"the location here was excellent, right on the beach. it was clean and the staff were really helpful.    the wifi is paid and not great but there are starbucks and other wifi places within walking distance that have good free wifi. the kitchen is not amazing (stove consists of two portable electric burners), but if you are not doing anything to complex or just doing breakfast and microwave stuff it is good.    i definitely recommend staying here for the location and cleanliness alone."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"well i just stayed in venice beach cotel for three nights! and i really enjoyed it!   very friendly and helpfull stuff! no matter what question i had they helped me to find an answer!  very clean for a hostel that hosts so many people! (2 bathrooms for one floor is not many, but okay).  directly located at the beach and free parinking in the direct neighbourhood (staff is very helpfull there)!  security could be improoved (no lockers in my room, had to / could leave my stuff at the reception...)."
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"for me this was the best hostel i have staying in in a long time!  it is functional and super clean, the location is great, though venice is a little sketchy at night so the good security on the hostel door was very reassuring. the staff are lovely, i felt safe and happy there, i would defo go back."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,frigin insane time t the venice beach cotel. staff were great and helpfull. met some great guys and girls. deffo good time. would be nice to have a big locker but no worries!
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"awesome crew of people, really secure, great location, heaps of fun."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,only downside was that you had to pay for wireless internet. in this day and age wireless really should be free at a hostel
Germany,Female,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,the staff taks a very good care of their guests and try to make everyone  feel like home - or somethink like that ;-) what i liked most was  that everybody can hang out at the bar in the evenings und that people that seemed strange were not allowed as guests.  especially for backpacker it is a great place to stay.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"unfortunate they didnt have free wifi, but you could use the restaurant downstairs, so more of an inconvenience.  staff were really helpful and had great personalities and were super helpful with any navigational questions. generally good time.  laundry mat is quite far away"
Australia,Male,41+,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,"good hostel, great position, enjoyed the beach and all of the characters wandering around and living in the area."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,8,"i enjoyed my stay at the cotel, the area is slightly dodgy and i didn't go out after dark but everywhere in venice beach is the same, you just need to have your wits about you. the hostel itself was pleasant and i recommend the tour of hollywood if you've got limited time too."
Australia,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,perfect every-thing a+++
Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,"very good hostel, clean and safe, directly located at venice beach. staff was very helpful. only minus: they charge $7 per day for wi-fi."
England,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"fun, friendly hostel with staff that go out of their way to please. situated right on the beach. very clean, they even changed my sheets with crisp new ones every day of my stay. highly recommended."
Australia,Male,25-30,9,0,6,10,0,10,10,10,"great atmosphere and staff, great location to venice beach and a nice hostel to stay in."
Australia,Female,41+,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,the staff were wonderful &amp; everyone was encouraged to meet in the lounge in the evenings to have a few drinks &amp; get to know all the other people staying there &amp; after we would go out as a group to the surrounding entertainment venues which is great esp if you're travelling alone.its right on the beach &amp; the markets &amp; food stands are right there. the rooms &amp; bathrooms were clean &amp; rooms had lockers(you just had to provide the lock &amp; key) i made alot of new friends &amp; would def return.
France,Male,25-30,5.7,0,6,4,0,6,6,4,"have to buy for 2 person to have a single room and impossible to have guest....  room done but not fully. really noisy. not on the best place(as soon as you go out, you're in front of homeless people and their putbull...). i don't think i'll come back one day..."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,8,6,"pretty good hostel... great location right on venice beach, good vibe and common room. rooms were hit and miss though - some were large and airy though the one we stayed in (3 bed mixed dorm) was tiny, stuffy and smelly... air didn't circulate at all. bathrooms were okay and quite clean. staff super bubbly and helpful. would be great if the internet was free... you even have to pay for wifi which is a huge pain.  would probably stay again."
NewZealand,Female,31-40,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,8,"there was no free wifi, however you you can buy for a reasonable price.  the rooms were large (4 bed female dorm) with own sink which was good  there was a lack of shared showers, which was disappointing but actually didnt prove to be a problem  overall the inside of the hostel is better than looking at it from the outside  free off street parking a short walk away as well which was a bonus."
Canada,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this is one of the best hostels i've stayed in. the staff is super friendly, the location is awesome and you meet great  people. just walking down venice beach is a relaxing experience, one see so much people from different backgrounds that enriches your own. so bad i had to left earlier than expected !!!    kerry, keep it up. much love for you and your people  !!!    hector"

Denmark,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i had the greatest time at the venice beach cotel. the location doesn't get any better. the staff were always helpful and the atmosphere was very loving and personal. i will definately recommend the cotel. thanks again for a super fun stay.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"epic location, don't bother with the rest of hell a  venice beach has more characters and colours and fun then the rest of the city combined. hostel is right on the beach, has a bar which serves your drinks you buy from a general store (cheap). cool staff, cool people, rad area."

England,Male,41+,6,0,6,2,0,8,6,6,"have just come back from a trip round the world including russia, china, japan, korea and lots of america.  this place was the worst i stayed in.  the whole area was very dangerous and very depressing.  the hostel was ok.  and i have stayed in a lot.  but not one that had noisy parties most nights til well gone midnight like this one.  definitely not the place for a brit of my age."
Russia,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"thank you for everything, it is the best hostel ive ever stayed in= ))"

Austria,Male,31-40,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"the hostel has an excellent location, just on the beach. in fact, i could see the beach and the sea from the room. it was quite clean and the staff was very friendly. there is a bar with a good atmosphere where every night people can meet and socialise. no wifi, no internet - that´s a pitty. good place to stay!"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,the best location ever! right at venice beach and near to santa monica. (the best area in l.a. anyway!) met very cool people there. it's clean and the rooms are nice.
Sweden,Female,25-30,7.3,0,6,10,0,8,6,8,an elevator would have been a huge plus.
China,Female,41+,6,0,6,8,0,2,6,8,this hostel overcharged me 72$ without any explanation. sent them 3 emails to ask but no feedback!
Chile,Female,25-30,5.3,0,6,6,0,4,2,10,"one of the worst hostels i've ever been. however it was very clean. the front desk is located in the 2nd floor so the first impression is how i'm gonna get upstairs with this luggage? don't have free wifi, free breakfast, or activities everyday so is not a good place to meet other people. just one block from the beach but its located in the middle of a really nasty place in venice, you have to be careful if u go out at night, there are lots of homeless people around. definitelly not recommended"
France,Male,41+,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"it's a youth hostel, but i appreciated that, despite i'am a mature adult, i was treated as the youngs."
Denmark,Male,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,"this hostel got the perfect location, it's literally  on the beach, and right next to muscle beach, venice beach streetbasketballcourt and you can easy go out surfing. like 0 min away from santa monica with bus."
England,Male,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,great! but i think the staff should be paid more so that they have more incentive to work!
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"thanks to the staff for being so helpful, especially the guy on the front desk who lent us his phone when we were having trouble booking flights!"
Canada,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,very good hostel with friendly staff and guests.  unfortunately the area where the hostel is located at is somewhat unsafe at night and would recommend going out in groups at night.  very interesting place during the day though!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.7,0,6,10,0,10,8,10,really good hostel. friendly staff and right on venice beach in the best spot. close to the busses into laand to santa monica. they have something to do every night  which is good. some rooms dont have lockerswhich is annoying but they can put them behind the front desk for you in a safe. if i came back to venice which i will i'd stay here again w/o a doubt.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,best location for venice. staff are excellent and there is a great social vibe. best be back around the hostel by sundown because it is a little shady at night. this is okay because the restaurant underneath the hostel is great for dinner and during the day venice is a blast; there is so much to see on the strip without having to spend a dollar. its worth renting a bike for the day and riding to santa monica and back.   free wifi from restaurant on north side of hostel.
France,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"the only negative point was having to pay extra fees in order  to use the  internet. i  had never had to pay extra, and surely didn't think i would have to for 40dls a night..  free towel service is great.  the rooms are hot though"
Argentina,Male,31-40,7,0,4,10,0,4,8,8,"the hostel is very well located near airport and venice beach. they don´t offer breakfast, neither lockers. internet connection is charged. i took some tours with them (night club tour and observatory tour) and the cost-benefit is not good.  the people and ambient is very nice, but there are many things to improve."
Canada,Female,18-24,8,0,10,8,0,8,8,8,"good! no negative comments really. a bit expensive, but worth the price.  it's clean, secure, and right next to venice beach.  good hostel in gerenal"
England,Couple,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,the staff were so helpful and answered any questions we had. check in isn't until 2 though. the location is right on the beach and its fairly easy to get the bus to hollywood and downtown la. the room was a bit boring though but it was cheap so its all good :)

Australia,Couple,25-30,7,0,6,8,0,8,8,6,"ideal for younger crowd, location great right next to venice beach and possible beach views...and 10 mins from santa monica.     kitchen wasn't great...too small and while they offer free tea and coffee there were no mugs to drink it in."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,10,8,4,everything was good except that it was ice cold at night and we just had really thin blankets.
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,8,8,"had lovely stay at the venice beach cotel.  being an avid hosteler having travelled all over the world, i wouldn't call the venice beach cotel an it spot to stay. however, what it may lack in a state of the art facility is made up by the service provided. had an initial issue with our rooming situation, not at the fault of the hostel themselves,  kerry, the manager, took care of it with a very professional manner. just goes to show, doesn't matter the cost, costumer service comes first. thanks!"
England,Male,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"the hostel location was awesome, and the reduced rate car parking was a lifesaver in this car unfriendly city!  helpful and friendly staff, also, the $5 evening meals were very good - more than worth the money and saved a lot of hassle.  very friendly - i met some great people to subsequently travel with. i have recomended this hostel to othera already and would defintetly stay here again."
USA,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i had a great time the 1st time i went to the cotel  in october ! i had so much fun i went back for another week!  it is a great safe and friendly place , you meet new people from all over the world and it is just a all around great time!the staff  they are great, lovely cleaning ladies sweet as can be, the girls that work at the desk friendly and very helpful ! i can't wait to go back to stay again!!! thank you for making my stay so great at the cotel!!!!"
Netherlands,Male,31-40,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,what a fantastic hostel with fantastic staff and guests! we celebrated nye in venice beach and couldn't have found a better place! epic!
USA,Female,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,very nice place to stay
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great hostel, very friendly and helpful, have no complaints. good security with a warm welcome."
Austria,Male,18-24,8.7,0,6,10,0,10,8,10,"the hostel is very close to the beach, staff is friendly and it was good to relax there. annother good thing  is that they make your bed. i recommend to stay there when you are at venice beach!"
Scotland,Male,31-40,5.7,0,2,10,0,8,4,4,"if you want to live on venice beach this place is best location.  when i arrive there is a smell in the air, rooms are dirty, but bedding seems clean.  bathrooms are very clean but no ensuite available.  staff were good, as the sink in my twin room was broken and a plumber came to fix it immediately.  security is bad, as i had no lockers and i had to stick my valuables in the safe at the main reception. lounge was cramped and full of guys in the evening, and fairly dirty."
NewZealand,Female,31-40,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"don't let the dirty stair-well put you off, the rooms are kept super clean and the beds are sooo comfy.   the staff were all very freindly.  my one complaint would be that smoking is allowed inside the upstairs lounge area, and it does make the whole place smell, i really think this lets the palce down :("
Switzerland,Male,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,it was just awesome! met great people in there!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,6,8,great location for a quick stop in venice.  friendly and very helpful staff!  good size rooms and pretty good value for money.  we had a great time in venice!
England,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"i love venice beach cotel, will def stay here again if i came to venice beach. the location is perfect and you meet so many new and friendly people, it's a really good place to stay when travelling alone. def a must stay if coming to venice beach."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.7,0,10,8,0,8,10,8,really great stay and super close to the beach nice as guy who runs the airport shuttles that we booked a ride with cudnt take us in the end so gave us cash for a taxi.nice clean little double room with shared bathroom
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great location overlooking venice beach and walking distance to many pubs and restuarants
England,Female,31-40,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"an excellent location right on the beach. on arrival, parking is very difficult to simply be able to unload, i had a parking ticket although parked in a 5 minute waiting zone while checking in. the parking enforcers seem to simply sit and wait! i was also charged for a night that i had cancelled and i was told that i had to e mail the manager rather than the staff sorting it out for me. however the matter was resolved quickly the next day with a different reception staff."
England,Female,18-24,5.3,0,8,8,0,6,2,4,"perfect for those wanting the slummin' it backpackers style, are if you are one of those you will love the area, very nice and alternative just be weary at night!   it's a simple hostel, fine for one night but you really can't relax there, not really my scene, ashamed as i am to admit it i've come to expect hostels to be like hotels only with more bed in each room, really  wish they could have fitted us in the h.i santa monica for another couple of nights."
England,Female,18-24,6.3,0,4,10,0,4,6,8,"stayed 9 nights, thanks to the ladies who cleaned our room it was great, although the bathrooms and kitchen were dirty. 1 helpful member of staff all the rest extremely unhelpful. on arrival, having called in advance to make sure our room was ready, we were made to wait a good few hours before it actually was. people smoking everywhere despite clear no smoking signs. great location, although we feel we paid far too much."
Canada,Couple,25-30,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"front door security very good, as reception was 24 hours and you had to buzz in at all times.  but we were a bit concerned by the fact that the window in our private room could not be locked.    many of the staff weren't overly helpful; seemed like they were travellers themselves who lacked knowledge of the hostel/area."
USA,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"good: stone's throw from beach, cheap places to eat nearby, byob but still having a pseudo-bar is a cool idea.    bad: closest parking was pretty damn far. wi-fi isn't free."
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.3,0,10,10,0,8,4,8,"very close to the beach and the boardwalk, a clean hostel.  the room was good, a double bed and single bed with en suite.  the are is not very safe after dark, so taxis are recommended if it's late.  there didn't seem like a lot to do in the hostel either."
Sweden,Couple,18-24,8.3,0,10,8,0,10,8,6,"great location if you want to spend time at the beach. the rooms are okay, ours was a little bit dark since we just had a windowview over a wall. the staff was nice and the kitchen was good for cooking."
England,Female,41+,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"venice beach cotel is a lovely friendly hostel, right on the edge of venice beach. the rooms are comfortable and clean. you have to climb up a flight of 32 stairs to get to the hostel. all the staff are really friendly and helpful. i stayed  here at the beginning of my four week road trip round california and liked it so much that i came back for four more days at the end of my trip. its the best place to stay in la, and venice beach has a magical atmosphere. below is a fab bar called danny's!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,6,"get yourself a free coffee and meet lots of nice and crazy travellers, any time of the day. perfect location in the more interesting part of la."
Spain,Couple,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"the hostel is very well located as it is in venice beach.  the rooms and toilets are clean and fine.    if you are lucky (or not), you can meet the governator by accident when riding a bike."
Sweden,Female,18-24,6.7,0,4,6,0,6,8,6,ok place but the staff was a big rude.
Belgium,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,10,8,8,8,"perfect for the price! kitchen, bathroom and tv in each shared room!!! however they should insist on the fact that the place is very noisy by its situation on hollywood blvd and because they put loud music till midnight and organise activities each night. so that's very cool for clubber and people who like that! i recommend this place anyway. just don't go there if you need calm ;) "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great atmosphere! the vibe at this place is chill and i loved my time there really didn’t want to leave.
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place love coming here when i fly to los angeles!!
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,8,4,6,6,10,8,6,location was about 20 min walk into main area of hollywood boulevard/ tourist attractions. did not feel safe outside of hostel and alone at night. was in a share room with ensuite and kitchen. clean though could be better. common room was dark and had unpleasant lingering odour. ground level becomes a car park at night and therefore outdoor activities become limited. staff super friendly. breakfast free with affordable extras options. heaps of activities put on by the hostel which was great!
England,Female,25-30,5.4,6,10,8,4,2,4,4,"dust, dirt, smelly and mess everywhere, however i will also contribute this to the fact that you are staying with other housemates. the rooms are tiny, hardly any space to move around let alone allow 6 people to put there luggage and move in the room... the staff have attitude and can be quite rude. i guess you get what you pay for... i learnt my lesson.. late night parties... very noisy.. its like living in crowded noisy student halls. parties, free alcohol and weed most nights. "
Sweden,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,4,8,"good place, not the best atmosphere but still it’s location is the best u can ask of a hostel "
Peru,Male,31-40,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,worse hostel experience of my life. terrible staff. extremely unprofessional and not safe. the guy at the office showed someone the copy of my id which happened to be my passport. this is not safe. the lady who checked me out was impossible to talk to. this is the worst hostel i have ever stayed in.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,aye i loved this place! i felt like i was back in college again! loved all the fun each night and the free breakfast made my long nights of drinking so much better! 
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,6,8,6,"a central hostel with a party atmosphere. alright facilities, but a bit dated, and dirty. the hostel is a party hostel with lots on but don't expect to sleep to well with noise travelling to the rooms from the main outdoor area. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,the dorm bathroom has a bath! had a long hot soak for the first time in months and it was amazing.  strong social atmosphere   breakfast was pretty basic  staff were helpful. there was an offensive person in our dorm so we told staff they had her kicked out.   no complaints
Australia,Female,25-30,8,10,8,10,6,6,10,6,it was fine 
Canada,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,10,10,4,"loved the hostel! all rooms have a tv, ac, heater, kitchenette, and full washroom in the rooms, the rooms are spacious and secure. only complaint would be the beds make lots of noise, mattress covers are broken &amp; not sure if they are sanitized.. found a condom under the bed, but the hostel is so worth the money and somewhat questionable beds.    hostel has lots of activities and even free meals and free booze some nights! they had a band, basketball, pool, ping pong, taco night,bbq, karaoke etc."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.1,6,2,6,6,4,4,8,"checked in and quickly checked out 30 minutes later. the girl at check in provided me with zero information about anything, she didn’t even give me any indication as to the direction of my room. i would’ve left without any sheets if i hadn’t remembered to ask as i left. once in my room, a parade of ten or so (in my dorm of 6) drunk, rowdy people were in and out every few minutes, so there goes any security. fine if you’re just there to party i guess. the whole place was just unwelcoming. "
Canada,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,staff was terribly friendly but i survived well enough
Canada,Female,31-40,8.3,10,8,10,8,6,8,8,my first hostel experience. great location and great dorms. they have washrooms and kitchens right in the dorm. i felt comfortable and safe. it's great to meet people from around the world. all in all wonderful first time experience.
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,good times here! free parking 
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,2,4,8,6,"stayed there for 3 nights, and didn't have blankets on two of the three. was only able to get blankets because someone from the bedroom was there during the day to grab it for me. when i inquired about it for the second time, staff told me ""i already told management, what do you want me to do?""  you better get breakfast as soon as it opens - 30 min after it starts there will be no bread (good luck to find bowls/plates/cups - they were always out of at least one of those). heating was terrible."
Malaysia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,10,8,"banana bungalow is a very good hostel. staffs are really friendly. nice location which is accessible to many places. i like all the activities organized by hostel.  it would be perfect if there are cleaner coming in everyday.  another point to improve is every bunk should have their own charging port as this would be more convenient.  overall, i’m satisfied "
Italy,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"i liked the atmosphere at banana bungalow hollywood, but i think the management should set a quite time. that's because in the night other guests were really loud and for me and my roommates it was difficult to fall asleep."
Colombia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,everything was very well !! i can recommend it !!
Indonesia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,6,8,10,8,8,overall staff were nice and helpful  price is cheap and pleasent stay here.   overall i felt safe here
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,"this is a good hostel and a pretty decent location. we had a private room for two people and was much bigger then expected!  we felt super safe the whole time as you need a code to get into the building. it is a bit of a walk to the centre of hollywood blvd and the hostel is located at a bit of a dodgier end but as i said, it’s super safe.  the flyaway bus is great - i would recommend this to anyone traveling to/from the airport.  breakfast is regular cereal and fruit but great an easy meal. "
Germany,Female,18-24,4.9,6,2,6,8,4,2,6,"good was the breakfast. bad was the rest. the staff was unfriendly, the room didn't match to the one i booked, it smelled like pot everywhere and the atmosphere was scary. i didn't feel safe. "
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,great spot if you are out to explore. was worth the money since la is so expensive. the only thing i would like for the next guests is that they actually put a mattress on the bed in room 105. i slept on a box spring. i thought it was just a hard bed but no it was actually a box spring. the hostess was nice and so were the people staying. 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,"best hostel of my trip! great location, great people and a fantastic atmosphere! i miss this place already! thank you banana bangalow! "
England,Female,18-24,4.3,2,4,6,4,4,6,4,"staff not helpful at all. the only decent person was the breakfast guy - which is free, so a bonus! (toast and cereal)   rooms arn’t that clean - found bugs in the room.   location is alright, i’d personally stay out of the city and venture in for the day as there really isn’t much to do in the centre.   uber pool is the best way to get around!   wouldn’t return!! "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,10,6,i really enjoyed my time here and made some long term friends! definitely recommend! the bathrooms and floors are only kinda clean but clean enough. it's located on hollywood boulevard but in a little less busy area what is nice. i would definitely stay here again!
Spain,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,8,8,8,8,4,"it was ""mostly"" fine for a budget hotel. it seemed clean, however within my one night stay i had encounters with 3 different small cockroaches in the room: one in the metal rail of my bunk bed, one in the cutlery drawer of the kitchen and one coming out of a ventilation opening.    "
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,very calm warm friendly fun family like atmosphere ...i would stay for as long as they would let me:)
England,Couple,18-24,6.6,6,10,8,6,4,6,6,"the breakfast was nice, but all served in disposable, non recyclable tableware. too much plastic waste, especially when the communal kitchen is fully equipped with reusable plates, mugs and cutlery. the location was quite close to the griffith observatory and the hollywood sign as well as many restaurants and a metro station. some members of staff were not the nicest towards guests, as if any question was too many but overall was nice but defo some places where improvements could be made easily!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.3,6,4,8,6,6,6,8,"good location to visit hollywood, but a little sketchy looking and set up with a motel in the same building.  staff was a hit and miss, 3 really cool people but one awful one that seemed to think she was doing me the greatest favor in the world for booking a bed in a room that was half empty.  overall decent at best.. worth it most for its location in my opinion, maybe the weekend activities are good, i’m not sure since i was there during weekdays.average in my opinion"
Netherlands,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here for 8 nights, great place, staff is amazing and the atmosphere was aslo really good. made a lot of new friends and would definitely go back there!"
Chile,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,10,6,6,10,6,"it’s a good hostel for solo travelers since it’s easy to meet fellow travelers and also the histel has got several events every week. however, i saw cockroaches at the bathroom most nights and also at breakfast i had to double check on the toast i chose because once it was expired and moldy."
USA,Male,41+,7.1,8,8,10,6,8,4,6,the place is conveniently located near the high way exit. but parking is limited  (free) and i have to pay $10 parking outside the hotel after going around the hotel for 15 min without finding a free street parking. it should marked as limited free parking. also the hotels is kind noisy when people come back from outside and talking after 2:00 am.
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"banana bungalow is my favorite hostel yet, and i’ve stayed in my fair share of hostels. the little kitchenettes are perfect and the stafd is lovely. i also love that they lend us both sheets and a towel , the only downside is the shower really . the water pressure was awful and it went from  cold as ice to boiling in seconds and back again with no warning.   all together though, it was awesome. a very party and socially oriented hostel. perfect for travelers looking to meet other travelers. "
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"good hostel in a great location! fun activities in the evening, although the dinner was cancelled one night and we weren't informed until we turned up for it which was annoying as we would have eaten elsewhere before coming back to the hostel. they lied and claimed the chef was ill when in fact i was speaking to someone the day before who the chef had told he wasn't going to be doing the next dinner so they clearly knew in advance and hadn't bothered to find a replacement or inform guests."
Belgium,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,"really nice place on hollywood boulevard, close to the main restaurants/places to visit - the staff is nice, while the rooms are not always clean; however, they made me change room when i complained. there is a bus from the airport directly to holywood boulevard, 10 minutes walking from the hostel (only downside: no indication of this bus at the airport). greatly recommended.  "
Japan,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,i couldn’t use a blanket. the night was a little bit cold.
England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,8,10,8,10,6,"really lovely atmosphere here, you will meet lots of cool people! dorm rooms are fairly basic but not bad. really enjoyed staying here:) "
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,"stunning place, really great feel to it. doesn't feel as much like a business as it does just a place for travelers to hang out."
England,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,"great for travelers, lots of trips and events daily. good facilities and staff and good free secure parking. location was ok, ubers are very cheap. room seemed cleaned however i got bitten a few times and found mites on my clothes. the windows are very thin and our room seemed to be next to the bins and building works going on so was very loud in the morning. not a bad stay, i would recommend for travelers who aren't too fussed, it personally wouldn't be my first choice to stay again."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,6,10,6,10,10,"i had the best time! the hostel made it easy to meet so many awesome people, the activities they planned were really fun. "
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,8,6,6,"stayed in a shared dorm. reallt noisy outside as there seemed to be no curfew or ""quiet hours"" so there was a lot of noise even after midnight including people playing basketball. the bathroom in our room was only seen to once our of 3 days stay, and with 6+ people using it it got pretty gross really quickly. "
England,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,10,6,4,6,2,"old converted motel. very secure parking with gate entry off street.   pros: location, price, facilities (apple computers, table tennis, pool table, sport equipment)   cons: really unclean, staff were pretty unfriendly (bar one), weird dirty kitchen in room, fridge didn't look to have been emptied in some time, shower didn't work correctly (didn't switch on and off properly).   personally, wouldn't stay here again. "
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,6,10,10,"i had a really positive experience with most of the staff, they were welcoming and helpful. there was only one staff member that was pretty rude towards me and it felt like she was very annoyed and irritated by just me being in the room trying to check in and check out, i wasn't asking for anything special or anything. the facilities were great, i loved how there was a kitchen, lockers and storage space in the mixed dorm. i loved how they had cool activities for the guests every day of the week."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,10,6,4,10,6,4,"we booked a 6 bedroom dorm and were checked into an 8 bedroom dorm, with only one shower this gets pretty crazy.   everything is dated and old and possibly the worst beds you can sleep in.  breakfast is super basic cereal and bread, but they do have almond milk if you can’t have regular milk so that’s a plus.  it’s in a really dodgy part of hollywood if you turn right at the entrance instead of left.  it communicates badly with the other banana bungalow in regards to events and stuff !"
Colombia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"better than i expected, excellent option to be in la, good atmosphere, nice place. totally recommended."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,"the staff are amazing, and great at organising loads of activities. our room had a bathroom and small kitchen which was perfect. no particularly clean, but everything worked. breakfast is excluded, and sufficient. would recommend staying here, as you are within walking distance of most sites, and have good transport links close by. "
Canada,Male,25-30,7.7,10,6,8,6,8,10,6,security gates open when a car pulls up so people can just walk in from the street. also there were not enough electrical plugs (less than 1 per bed) to charge electronics.
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,4.9,4,6,4,6,6,4,4,"2 particular staff members were unapproachable, rude and unhelpful. we met another guy i think from oz who was so friendly and helpful. rooms were downcast. the window fan overlooked another guest’s bed so was turned on/off at their convenience(probably because of the noise they had beside them). this was during the oct heatwave,making the rooms very uncomfortable to sleep in aswell as smelly. the building looks great and has a great vibe but with the negatives mentioned made it disappointing"
Brazil,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel, really close to walk of fame and a lot of eating options around. staff were nice and friendly.  complete private rooms, full kitchen ;-)"
Ireland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,8,6,"not the cleanest hostel or in the nicest of areas. but they 100% make up for it with personality. the guests are all really chill and down to party, there are tons of activities every day. you will never be bored and its super easy to make friends. recommend it, if you like to meet people, have a couple of drinks and go on nights out. had an amazing time."
Canada,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i would recommend!!
Australia,Female,25-30,6.3,6,10,8,6,4,8,2,an old converted motel. was weird to have a kitchen inside even though no one used it. there was food left there from previous people. it was quite dirty. the cleaners don't clean everyday so the carpet and bathroom were filthy after a couple of days. good common areas and easy to meet people. front desk lady was a bit unfriendly.  many chances to go drinking and clubbing with free shuttles. super squeaky beds and no power outlets. the more you pay the better the facilities which is a bit unfair
Ireland,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a seriously good spot to get your hollywood on.  as near to most things in l.a. as it could ever be possible to be.
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,10,6,"great hostel with good vibes. very generous with food and free alcohol on the club nights! staff are super helpful, shoutout to sol who was just awesome. "
CaymanIslands,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"first hostel i’ve ever stayed at and i wasn’t disappointed. great location to most attractions, friendly staff, good facilities (pool table, imacs, printer, tv, basketball court, lounge/stage area.  you can see the staff make an effort when hosting/organizing events.  i was happy with my stay and would stay there again. the best thing about this place is the price per night and it’s location. "
Mexico,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"me encanto la estancia ahí, estuve 5 días y el ambiente super juvenil, las fiestas en la noche, hice algunos buenos amigos, el agua caliente a toda hora, definivitamente me quedaria nuevamente sin pensarlo dos veces"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,10,10,8,8,6,8,8,"stayed in a private room with a queen bed.     pros: room, bathroom and kitchen were very spacious and clean. good location, only 5-10 min walk to walk of fame, and easy to catch the subway anywhere else. good value for money.  cons: music playing till late in the night, it would be nice if the staff turned it down as it's 24/7 reception. only 1/3 staff members i spoke with were friendly. it would also be nice if the breakfast staff wiped the tables from the night before."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very cool place! be aware that hostel world call the dorm rooms different to what the hostel offers. we order a 6 mixed private dorm, and there was 8 people all together in our room. but banana bungalow was awesome, great place and would highly recommend"
Finland,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,8,8,4,"location was handy, parking spot was super easy &amp; safe, breakfast ok. in one of the corridors, there was a strong smell of puke for a few days. also, our room had a ""tipping envelope"". i haven't seen these even in that many hotels earlier, and they feel weird in a hostel environment."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,each room has its own kitchen! really cool set up and very social environment 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"pretty good value for money . rooms were cleaned daily, staff were mostly helpful and welcoming. would definitely book again for a short stay in hollywood. "
Portugal,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,10,6,6,4,2,"be careful! this hostel is full of cockroaches and insects. the cleanliness was the worst i've ever seen in many years, and the hostel staff didn't apologize or did nothing to us. we had to sleep inside of our car! the only good point of this place is the location.     "
USA,Female,41+,2.6,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,"it turned out to be a different hostel. im registered with hostel international. the place i went to said ""vibe"". i lost my next day of work as tgeir alarm clock did not work. cotinental breakfast was ""downstairs can't get even a cup of coffee""! i was over charged ($47not$33 and next day i was asked to pay for a 4 seater for myself!! $100)( this is attrocious for a disabled person in a wheelchair! )from the rate online and i'm still chasing to find the reimbursable booking fee($7.?) "
Germany,Male,25-30,6.6,6,6,6,8,4,8,8,normally hostels booked via hostelworld take a 10% deposit and you pay the rest on arrival. this hostel took all the money after the booking so i had trouble getting the rental car. be aware of that !!!  the hostel is pretty chill direct on the hollywood boulevard. party isn't that good due to california law closing pubs on 2am.  if i would to my trip again i would prefere a hostel close to the beach.
HongKong,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"roommates are friendly, staff is helpful &amp; nice. fair price in la &amp; good for backpackers. location is fine, near to hollywood/highland:)"
Canada,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,"the ladies at the front desk were not very informative when we checked in in regards to where rooms/lounge/activities were. didn't feel overly welcomed. but the breakfast attendant made up for it as he was chatty, energetic, and informative about the area and nearby events going on. it's nice how the two bungalow hostels get together for certain night events. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,nice hostel with great events and lots of socializing and fun. definitely would stay again. 
Scotland,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,6,4,10,each room has a kitchen rather than a communal one. the female staff seemed disinterested but the male staff were friendly. the location is good as it's close to a metro &amp; shops but i felt unsafe in the area. there was no atmosphere when i was there and the activities which involved driving were cancelled because their driver was ill. the breakfast was good and i was happy to see they supplied non dairy milk :)
Argentina,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"recomiendo mucho este hotel! todo muy nuevo, estaba lleno y súper tranquilo. no tiene aire pero dormimos bárbaro con el ventilador. resultó mucho mejor de lo que pensábamos!! "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,8,8,10,8,6,"staff were really accommodating and friendly. free breakfast was a nice plus. free drop offs to venice beach, universal studios and griffith observatory. beds were not very comfortable and rooms were hot. "
HongKong,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,6,10,6,8,8,"i don't think the location is safe enough. except this, everything is fine, value for money, good breakfast. "
Colombia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place, i definitely going back, thanks!"
Malaysia,Female,25-30,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,4,a little bit far from metro. nothing much i recommnd of this property. facilities just so so. breakfast their provide was a bonus but just cereal and toast.
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,10,6,good decent place to stay if you there to party.
Brazil,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"helpful and friendly staff. parking is very important as the region does not have many free options. however, if you are arrive late, there’s a chance it’s full. provate room is fine, considering its price. very good price-benefit ratio."
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"fantastic atmosphere, great location and staff. will definitely stay again"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first ever hostel stay! was great :)
Philippines,Female,25-30,5.7,6,8,6,4,8,6,2,"the staff were nice. they let my friend and i stay in the party room when we arrived early. the facility cleanliness was disappointing. there were roaches in the room, crawling on the dining room table. the bathroom was not the cleanest either. the bed was okay, loud and squeaky but pretty comfortable. the free breakfast was a plus! "
England,Female,25-30,4.3,6,6,4,6,2,2,4,"we did not enjoy our stay here. the manager is not friendly at all. parking is rubbish. only a few spaces first come first served. very noisy, party's every night and screaming in early hours of morning. didn't feel in a safe area. breakfast was not good. we stayed in hi fishmans wharf in san francisco before this and this was 10x better and cheaper. "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,6,4,8,good location but not much atmosphere. reasonably priced for the location. kitchen in the dorm rooms is great. very clean. 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i will highly recommended 🍌 banana hostil. very nice and kind  people! !!😃😄😍
USA,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel! there is so much for guests to do. they have fun activities set up to get the guests together. the private i stayed in was awesome, it was equipped with a kitchen and its own bathroom and tv.  the breakfast was decent. "
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,8,6,"great place to stay if you’re looking to meet people and party. cleaniless could be better. staff were so nice, mo and sol were especially friendly and great, we had a fun night out with them. "
Wales,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,i  had issues with my original roomate as it was a non smoking room and he continued to smoke in the room and i have asthma which caused problems. i told reception and was moved and was happy where i was placed in the other room. the rubbish left after other guests was not cleaned away properly. the wifi not reaching the rooms was annoying. overall it's an awesome place and warming people make it a cool place to be. it's location is awesome you just walk up and see the stars!!
Turkey,Male,18-24,6.3,4,8,8,6,2,8,8,we had problem about parking and night personel behave us rude .
Australia,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"bearing in mind you get what you pay for, banana bungalow is top value for money. the rooms are clean and the dunny and shower/bath in the six person room my son and i rented was functional. there is a free breakfast of toast or cereal and a few times a week a $5 dinner which was good and plentiful. it's probably more a a young person's hostel but i'm 59 and didn't feel out of place and there were a few other older souls too. it's also close to hollywood and the metro. i'd stay again. "
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"best hostel i have ever stayed at in terms of atmosphere! met so many great people and the karaoke night and organised nights out cannot be missed! most guests were solo travellers, i was with 2 friends but it is the perfect hostel for individuals as everyone is so friendly. rooms are standard. definitely a hostel for the younger generation which was perfect for us but if you are seeking a quiet place to stay i would recommend elsewhere. loved it and would definitely return!"
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this was my first time in l.a, it was also my first time staying in a hostel and i've got to say it was an amazing experience. the hostel is a short walk from the walk of fame as well as amazing places to eat and drink.  the hostel its self has a fantastic atmosphere with its various different party night and it's chilled and welcoming feel. i made a bunch of new friends and made some fantastic memories.  and to top it all off when i messed up my flight the staff were very helpful! i'll be back!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"i really like the location but i prefer the other banana bungalow, i know this isn't the hostel's fault but even the other travelers seem more friendly and fun comparing to this one. other than that, it is an okay. it is clean, safe, have a good breakfast. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,10,8,very easy to make friends here! atmosphere is a big 10/10 for a hostel.   tip: don't underestimate the parties they offer during the weekend! to much fun :)
NewZealand,Female,18-24,4.3,2,2,2,8,2,6,8,"was totally unsafe, checked about early due to an altercation with another patron. would not recommend to anyone travelling by themselves "
India,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,10,6,8,10,"great location,great rooms.. it's a motel converted into hostel beds.. which makes it more interesting!  i had a great time in l.a.. they have good freebies and activities.. good social gathering..  breakfast not so great!   and  reception isn't as informative or personal as one would expect.. but i guess that's more like the american way!   in all would definitely come back if i had a stay a couple of nights"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place to stay in a terrific location, just a 5-10 minute walk from the main strip of hollywood boulevard. staff are great, accommodating and friendly and arrange activities pretty much every night for all to join. plenty of space to socialise with others but also to isolate yourself and have some time on your own. metro and bus stops are nearby so getting across the area is easy. definitely recommend staying, would 100% return to banana bungalows if i visit la/hollywood again. "
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"this place had amazing events in the night time, a variety of things to do during the day. the rooms were well insulated as well from the noise so you couldn't even hear the crazy karaoke unless you left the room. its location on the boulevard may seem confusing at first - as in you think you're miiiles away from the heart of it but in reality it's only a few minutes walk away. also very near a bus stop and a variety of places to get food.  wifi was spotty and could be improved. "
Hungary,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was the best hostel what i have ever been ! our room was large, we had an own kitchen ( !!! ) and bathroom as well. they took us to the universal studio by shuttle for free. the breakfast was simple but enough and you can get omletts for low budget. they organized many programs for us for example karaoke, beerpong, stand up comedy"
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location was perfect, close enough to easily get to attractions, but far enough that you got some quiet time. the layout &amp; breakfast area was great. staff was very helpful &amp; so much fun. we were there friday &amp; saturday nights, there was a great party/get together, only $20 for all ypu could eat &amp; drink. they offered shuttle service to the clubs &amp; made sure everyone was safe. i was very happy with the experience, would stay there again &amp; highly recommend to anyone wanting to enjoy hollywood."
SouthAfrica,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,really enjoyed my stay here:) super vibey place and kept clean and tidy ✨🙌🏼
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay. it was clean, full of life, and awesome location. i highly recommend it!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"i stayed in a 6 bed dorm and it has its on bathroom and kitchen which was great. location is very good, walking distance from hollywood and highland (busy section of hollywood boulevard). the hostel had organised events most nights so would probably be good for lone travellers. there is a free breakfast which is cereal, tea/coffee, toast with peanut butter and jelly or nutella. it was nothing special but it was free so no complaints!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,6,6,8,absolutely nothing to complain about. i got the impression this place had recently turned into a hostel from a former motel. they have daily activities and a table tennis table but due to the motel set up didn't quite have the perfect hostel vibe. our room faced onto hollywood boulevard so there was a lot of traffic noise. 
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,this place is amazing. definitely would recommend if you are willing to socialize. i met so many people around the world. everyone is friendly. i am so sad to have left - i cried. 
France,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"good value for money considering the cost of accommodations in la. the hostel is pretty stylish and location is awesome. atmosphere was okay but they could try to organise more events, pub crawls etc. breakfast was not great, only some lousy bread and pb (skippy:( ), cereals, at the end the best thing was nutella........ all the rest (eggs, bacon etc.) isn't for free and even pricey!! (6$). that could definitely be improved with at least some juice, fruits, jam and better products!"
Israel,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,great atmosphere and the staff are always available to help and recommend.  the location is awesome really close to the walk of fame and there is a metro station close to the hostel.  a great place to stay in hollywood!
England,Male,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,6,6,6,6,"good and with some great travellers, and also some terrible ones. also, lots of the 'free' elements included were cancelled without mention or apology. comedy night was great though.  "
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,i had the best time at banana bungalow. met some amazing people! would go again.
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,8,8,very nice location and fhe staff was great.
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this hostel is in a great location for people looking to explore hollywood. in a half day hike through griffith park, you can see the griffith observatory and the hollywood sign. the hollywood walk of fame is right out the front door. there are two world class comedy clubs a very short cab ride away (the laugh factory and comedy store). i stayed in one of dorms and found it very comfortable. there was an ac unit and a mounted wall fan for hotter nights. i'd stay there again and i'd recommend it."
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,8,10,10,10,6,fab place! and only walking distance from walk of fame but a little bit sketchy if you walk on other side of the road. great staff and facilties and fab that the sleeping area was separated within the rooms. 
England,Male,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,good all round
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,10,8,8,10,"good location close to universal studios, hollywood sign and the walk of fame, although the walk of fame really isn't much to see. was a bit disappointed with hollywood, it's a pretty grungy place and around 1 hour from santa monica pier. i would definitely recommend staying in venice beach which is a much nicer area if you're planning on staying in la for more than 2/3 days (especially in summer). otherwise, the hostel was nice and the rooms were a good size with the kitchen being a plus!"
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"all perfect, the only thing i didn't like was that they do so much waste about plastic plates in breakfast for example. but i think is a la thing. i saw it in the other hostels as well. it would be better if they give us regular dishes and we wash them ourselves to don't do so much plastic waste. "
Egypt,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,8,10,10,"excellent hostel, location is good not to far from metro and 5 blocks away from walk of fame. staff was so helpful, especially mo he is such a great person though! atmosphere was so good for solo travels  i would definitely come here again."

Brazil,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,i loved there !!! really great vibe 
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,you cannot beat the location! major land marks were 15 min away. fun bars were nearby. love that there was free parking in a secured location.  i stayed in a private room and it was very clean and in a quiet location. great hostel overall.
Chile,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place. from the attitude over the phone to check in to check out. everyone here is good vibes. room was super clean and had its own kitchen and bathroom with shower. there are planned activities everyday. there was free food and beer. the guests all seem to be in a friendly mood as a place like this would have that effect on people. i recommend this place very much. i would definitely go back!
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,10,6,8,6,8,6,4,"good location, short walk to the main attractions of hollywood, but there isn't a designated smoking area"
USA,Male,25-30,7.4,10,10,4,4,10,4,10,"upside:   affordably priced.     downside:   it's a party atmosphere here, if you are looking for a peaceful time, that will be difficult.  "
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,friendly staff. down to earth. perfect place just blocks from downtown hollywood.
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great place. much more social than many hostels in the us. i wound up not being a huge fan of hollywood boulevard, but it was good to get to see it. i thought that the atmosphere here was really nice, and my dorm had its own bathroom and kitchen."
Ireland,MixedGroup,18-24,3.4,2,4,8,2,2,4,2,staff were extremely rude and mostly unhelpful! apart from when they were trying to scam money of you! one member of staff offered to help us get to 6 flags and it was only when we returned we found out he was overcharging us for an uber and lining his own pockets! rooms were disgusting and looked although they hadnt been cleaned in weeks and the shower so was so dirty it was unusable!  also booked a 6 bed room and was given an 8
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome hostel!!
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"the hostel is in a great location if you want to stay on hollywood blvd and the price was extremely affordable. the room i was in had its own bathroom and kitchen area and everything was clean. the staff were extremely nice and helpful, and the guests staying there were very friendly. guests also have access to wifi, tvs, computers, pool table, basketball court, ping pong table, and places to hang out and visit. there are also scheduled events for guests that the hostel coordinates. "
India,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,hostel is located at far end of hollywood boulevard. rooms are spacious and clean. staff was helpful and free shuttles help explore la. 
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,10,8,"very good!  coded security door to get in, key cards for the rooms.  my 8-bed ensuite was split into 2 rooms so it wasn't a mass of people in one area.  it also had a full kitchen (more or less), never seen that before!  they had event nights (open bar, food, and entry to bars) both nights which was great for meeting other guests.  they interact a lot with the sister hostel in west hollywood so you'll meet two hostels worth of people on the event nights!  lockers are small-ish.  would stay again"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"we stayed in the west hollywood banana bungalows before which we did prefer, although the location of this one is great for exploring hollywood. the rooms didn't have air con so they were boiling and there was a kitchen in the rooms but very little in the kitchen so you couldn't really do much with it. the organised nights put on here were really fun though! "
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,10,6,8,10,we had an overnight in la and wanted to visit the hollywood sign and santa monica. the hollywood sign was easily accessible in an uber and santa monica was a bit of a hike (about 1.5 - 2 hours) via a bus or uber. when we arrived we were told it was taco night so ended up getting dinner and breakfast for free which was awesome!! the room itself was spacious and had its own bathroom and kitchen. beds were comfy and air con was fine for the time of the year. 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,such a great place to stay! 
Armenia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, friendly staff , free breakfast, walking distance to hollywood sign, a lot of freebies "

"
England,Female,25-30,5.4,2,8,10,6,4,4,4,"this hostel is in a great location. some of the staff are very friendly and helpful but there was one who was in a consistently bad mood and not very helpful at all.  we were in a room with three bunks for a total of 4 nights. there were 10 people including us who were there these four nights and the bathroom was cleaned once the entire time. also if you do go here bring hand soap as there's none. i've never experienced this before at a hostel, especially one that charges so much. not worth it"
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,6,6,6,4,"an ok hostel in a great location. the staff were often not very friendly and asked as though they didn't want to help you. quite expensive for what it is, despite this i would stay here again if in la based on location."
Austria,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,10,6,great hostel to explore hollywood. events are on every night. staff is great.
Colombia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i will completely recommend this place !! friendly staff, helpful and smily ... i'm happy i could had met the people at this place "
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,nice place. easy to get to things within hollywood. a bus ride to the observatory. i was there on the 4th july and they had a bbq and party there which was good. friendly staff and guests. clean place with en suite and a kitchen in each room. 
USA,Female,31-40,6,8,8,6,6,2,4,8,my arrival time to the hostel said 10am but the rude blonde lady at the front desk said that i had to wait until 2pm to check in. she had a really bad attitude when i brought this to her attention. it made me decide to never stay at banana bungalow again! i am not going to be paying for this level of poor service. 
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"one of the best hostales that i've been, great locations, great rooms and great people and the best good price "
Canada,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,"if i was someone who really wanted to just sleep this is not the place, every night there was a party going on in the bar. in saying that i had so much fun and met a lot of awesome people, it's a bit of a walk the subways and food but would definitely book here again!"
Russia,Male,41+,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,"good location, friendly staff always ready to help, and overall very positive experience."
Colombia,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,"the room was not cleaned in the 4 days we were there, eventhough we left the sign by the door. the location was pretty good. "

England,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"staff were friendly, great breakfast, atmosphere was good, but spoiled by loud music from hostel speakers (not even from other guests) blasting 24 hours a day. if you want to sleep, earplugs are a must!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"great location near hollywood and super friendly and helpful staff members! i'm horrible with names but there was a british guy who gave us so many tips about things to do which was a fantastic help. free parking was great and well organized by staff, just wish i could have stayed a little longer and timed my trip better in order to enjoy the activities that were on!

Australia,Couple,25-30,8.9,6,8,8,10,10,10,10,great hostel had a great time here.

USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"this was the first time i ever stayed in a hostel, and it was an excellent experience. the people were fun, the location was great, and i would definitely stay here again. the only reason this review doesn't have a 10/10 is because on several accounts my key stopped working and sometimes the 24 desk wasn't staffed. i just would have to go downstairs to get it fixed but it was still hassle when you're up and down the stairs and sometimes someone wasn't there to help. still, i would go back!  "
Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,10,6,8,8,had a awesome time. stuff wasn't allways nice and helpful. location is really good.. metro and bus isn't far. 
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,"loved the banana bungalows, had a private room for me and my boyfriend and it was huge with its own kitchen and bathroom. only complaint would be the air conditioning wasn't good enough, we only had a fan in the bedroom and a vent in the kitchen window. social side of it was great was lots to do bar crawls comedy nights bbq's plenty of opportunity to meet new people. it was far from the beaches though, about an hour in an uber to venice beach. definitely recommend! "
Scotland,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"pretty quiet when i was there. clean rooms and although i'd booked my two nights separately, they offered to sort it so i could stay in the same room, easy. walking distance to attractions on hollywood (including nice farmers market on sunday mornings) and easy to get to and from the airport using flyaway bus. "
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.4,8,8,4,10,6,6,10,"free breakfast was great, and the private rooms are really good value for money - they are huge and the kitchen is nice.     location isn't perfect, though can walk (about 15 - 20 minutes) to central hollywood district.   "
England,Female,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"would definitely recommend this hostel. clean, great location and friendly staff. lots of activists going on, breakfast available and free parking. "
England,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,2,8,8,8,"booked this hostel because it's advertised to have free parking. given that we had a rental car we were counting on secure parking, particularly because la can be 'sketchy'. when we arrived at check-in there were no parking spaces and cars all squeezed in behind each other. when we asked reception about this they advised that parking was on a first come first served basis. had i known this prior to booking i'd have booked elsewhere! "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"good location for exploring hollywood. clean, comfy, good breakfast. felt very secure. i could have stayed there much longer and would definitely stay there again. "
NorthernIreland,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"we stayed in a private room and were very pleased with the room and facilities. the room was spacious, and the kitchen and bathroom were good. the room was fitted with a safe. i can't fault the cleanliness of the room, and the staff that we spoke to were friendly and helpful. the location is good, but it is about a 30 minute walk along hollywood boulevard from the hostel to the main part of the strip where the dolby theatre etc are located. i would be keen to stay here again if i'm in la again."
Israel,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay so much that i extended it for few more days so i can hang some more! great location, the rooms are big with a privet bathroom and shower and a full kitchen! the parking is awesome, free and right downstairs! great activities almost every night and the staff is amazing!!! highly recommend!"
England,Couple,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,10,8,10,8,"banana bungalow is at what seems to be the slightly dodgy end of hollywood boulevard however once you get into the complex its a lovely place and the rooms are equipped with everything you need for your stay as well as offering free breakfast, great events almost every day and loads of activities like ping pong and basketball. there is also parking which is very helpful given la is so hard to get around without a car. if you want to explore hollywood then banana bungalow is a great location."
Wales,Couple,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"homeless men in our room. one whom had paid for a night but the other was obviously a mate who kept ""forgetting"" his key card multiple times. felt uncomfortable and unsafe. staff were not approachable, vacant! did not feel we could speak to them about this issue in confidence. man smoking weed in the dorm during the night, stinking the place out. extremely noisy until early hours of the morning. location quite far from main hollywood attractions and did not feel safe walking back in the evening!"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,8,4,8,8,2,"nice atmosphere and great location but they don't give you any blankets, only sheets, so i was freezing every night!! room was very dirt and smelt awful and common kitch was also extremely unhygenic and had a bad smell. nice courtyard area"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've ever stayed in. loads going on, loads of amazing people and staff. centrally located and free or cheap events, food and drink."

Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"-security was pretty good, didn't have anything stolen except for sunglasses but i'm pretty sure it was a guest in the room who is responsible.  -location was pretty good since it was close to the main hollywood area which has lots of places to eat, thoug"
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,6,10,8,"good location and very good atmosphere if you want to socialise and have fun (but if you want somewhere quiet this isn't ideal. breakfast is fairly good and our 6 bed room had a kitchen and bathroom so was really practical. not there for too long but seemed like they organised a fair few activities and is fairly close to public transport, 7eleven and liquor stores. only problem was the staff were a bit inconsistent - some were really nice, helpful and friendly but others weren't at all."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,my girlfriend and i went there for the memorial weekend and slept in 8 bunk beds with two rooms and one bathroom and a shower for all. no issues at all and no complaints. can see the the hollywood sign view from the room. the parking is fine. they will ask you to drop off your key in the front office to keep it safe. 
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,realty great hostel. everyone was so friendly and the nightly events were great for getting to know each other. 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,brilliant!! they do events every night inside and outside the hostel. they also link events with their sister hostel so always new people
Australia,Male,31-40,6.6,6,10,6,6,6,6,6,the hostel is located on the outskirts of the main hollywood area. the hostel is probably ready for some renovations. with the wear and tear from years of travelers staying. its a good option for 1 or 2 nights if you are on a budget. 
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had an amazing time in this nice hostel. they offer parties and free food. employees are veryfriendly and the rooms are very comfortable!!! you will definitely love staying here.
Australia,Female,18-24,5.1,6,6,4,8,2,6,4,staff were very impatient and rude all the time! 
HongKong,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the staff are really friendly and helpful. the atmosphere is good with a lot of activities going on every day. however, if you want to get some good sleep, remember to bring your earplugs because they host singing events with loud music during some evenings!"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"the banana bungalow hollywood is in a great location. it's close to many restaurants and hollywood attractions. the hostel held daily, free events which i recommend taking advantage of. the hostel is all ages, there were families there. if you're looking for that party environment, my friends and i enjoyed the bar crawls that were hosted by the hostel and it's location in west hollywood. overall, great stay at the banana bungalow hollywood!"
Latvia,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great location, great staff, definitely will stop over there again next time"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,"had a great stay at banana bungalow - mainly due to the incredible friends that i made there on my 2 week stay. the hostel was great because it has a really social area on the ground level where they have a table tennis table, pool table, lots of chairs and tables and had music playing. one of the staff ladies' at reception never semed to have a smile on her face and always seemed angry. also noticed one male staff member that had inappropriate relations with guests. great hostel though!"
Malaysia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,6,8,6,8,8,"the location was neither here nor there, it was in between the griffith observatory and hollywood walk so depending on what is the aim of your stay the location works! you would still need to walk out to get to anywhere including the public transportation. there are good options of food not too far. secondly, bring your own locks if you would like to use the lockers provided!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,staff and place was great. they hosted epic free dinners and parties for both hostels and it is value for money staying at this hostel.
Scotland,Couple,25-30,5.4,6,8,8,6,4,2,4,"the worst bed i e ever slept in after 4 months of staying in hostels, uncomfortable and very squeaky, couldn't make a simple move without it being noisy.  the place is very run down, needs a quote of paint and the breakfast. at area needs a good power wash...  the night time receptionist had a bit of an attitude too... i hated it. "
Estonia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i liked this hostel, it was clean and stuff was very friendly:) "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8,6,10,10,6,8,8,8,had a good time here - good open style accomodation 
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,"this hostel was pretty well worth the price. i did not see staff too often but they were helpful when i needed them. free parking and free breakfast (although if you want a filling breakfast you'll have to pay). bathrooms are inside each room, which means one bathroom for six people... proximity does not equal convenience. but it was clean. very international and met lots of great people. i would stay here again"
England,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,8,10,10,8,"great atmosphere, nice staff, the tiki lounge is a great place to relax in the sun and get chatting to other people, and i met some really lovely friends during my stay. the karyokie and night out on a wednesday is great fun, with free mexican food! everything is clean, showers work well, wifi is good and always reached my room. beds aren't that comfy but manageable, no individual lights by bed which can be difficult if some are trying to sleep and u are awake or vise versa. lockers in room. "
Taiwan,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this is a good hostel in la. good atmosphere and provide breakfast like coffee, milk and bread. i lived in a 6 mixed dorm, we shared a kitchen and a bathroom.  there were about three wall sockets in a room. the hostel has different activities every night like movie night, bbq or party...etc. it takes extra money of course. the parking lot can park around 15 cars. first come first park, you have to park outside when it is full. overall it is a good hostel, i'd like to stay here again."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,staff were amazing &amp; there were a ton of free activities/food/etc. location was great and they offer shuttles to major attractions.
Denmark,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the staff was so welcoming and friendly and helpful, especially mary in the reception. the place was cozy and the food (you can buy different breakfast meals with eggs and stuff) was excellent. we were very pleased with our visit."
Paraguay,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,i loved it! one night they gave us free drinks and food! and the breakfast is awesome.
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,very good vibe hostel. nice people and the fact each room has a small kitchen and a bathroom is really convenient. 
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved my stay here!!! the staff were friendly, everyone was so nice, and the room was great. i ended up having wonderful roommates the entire time i was there, which was lucky!! the courtyard and tiki garden were above my expectations, it was amazing. i would definitely stay here again, overall just a perfect hotel experience in my opinion. "
Switzerland,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,6,6,8,very noisy stay. i used to stay there in my early twenties but not sure i would do it again now... the room was great and very clean but the karaoke night lasted well past midnight and made me feel very uncomfortable with an early day awaiting me the morning after.  
England,Male,31-40,5.4,4,10,8,4,6,4,2,other than a v friendly host - dishing out wine and serving breakfast - everything else was pretty average 
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,8,8,nice place to stay in hollywood. good facilities. would stay here again.
Italy,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,8,6,we had to change room 3 times because somehow someone checked in with my name few hours before. we also had to wait 45 minutes before leaving since an hostel van was blocking our car and the couldn't find the keys 
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i met such cool people here, when i was traveling for work. everyone was super friendly and welcoming and that is something you need if you travel alone constantly. i made instant friends and i could have stayed there for weeks. i will definitely be back!!"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,this hostel is great if you are looking for somewhere right in the centre of hollywood.  there is a great atmosphere and the majority of staff are absolutely lovely and willing to help.  points for improvement could be the cleanliness (fairly standard for a hostel of this nature).  last note one of the receptionists is essentially useless in explaining anything that you may need to know about the hostel but there are usually others around who have a bit of an idea so just look out for them :) 
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was not able to go to the hostel but i got a refund by the people that work there and they were very kind
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,8,overall staying at the banana bungalow was great. good value for the $. you're right on hollywood blvd so you are not to far away in terms of walking to the walk of fame and nokia and chinese theatre. the only problem i faced was the check in. we confirmed a check-in for 12pm but were only allowed to check in at 2pm. so instead of getting are stuff settled after coming from the airport we have to keep our bags in a holding area with other guests and kill 2hrs. 
France,Female,18-24,3.1,4,2,2,2,2,2,8,"worst hostel i've ever stayed !  i've stayed in about 30 hostels across as many countries and this one is just not good. staff is rude, rooms and lockers are small, beds are not comfortable at all, its super noisy. there was a problem with my booking and they woke me up at 11pm to make me change room because mine was overbooked. yes you're closed to hollywood blvr but that's it. you're an hour away from anything else. go to banana bungalows west hollywood instead, i've stayed in both.  "
China,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,10,8,stayed here for 2 nights really love the all games ppl is nice and friendly. location is good. second day nothing to do just play sport games with hostel new friends. nice one hostel to stay.
Austria,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"this hostel is a great place for a sightseeing trip to l.a. a 20 minute walk down hollywood boulevard are lots of attractions and entertainment. the staff is also very nice and helpful.   a negative aspect about our stay was, that the heating didn't work. with outside temperatures at about 15 degrees celsius, our room got very cold over the night, since the room is hardly insulated.   apart from that i would absolutely recommend this hostel."
Netherlands,Male,25-30,4.6,4,6,8,4,4,4,2,party hostel. do not come here to sleep.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel in hollywood by far, everyone on the staff was amazing and polite. great vibes at the vibe hotel forsure. i'll be back!! "
Pakistan,Male,25-30,8,8,6,10,8,10,8,6,"it's a pretty decent hostel and is definitely in the best location. griffith observatory is 1 hr hike, walk of fame is 5 minutes. they include free parking + breakfast which is amazing.    cons: in hostels, most people are concerned about their belongings. although this hostel provides lockers, you have to bring your own lock or buy one for $2. this is the only thing that bothered me. otherwise it's. a pretty decent place for $33."
Australia,Male,41+,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,"good place close enough to hollywood and vine station though a bit of a walk from all the action but not that far....  not as much of a party hostel as usa hostels down the road but about 10/15 dollars cheaper, though it does have stuff with its sister hostel.overall a very good choice you won't be disappointed with. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,da best of da best
France,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,that's a really nice place to stay in la. 
England,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,well located near to the hollywood walk of fame and not far from amazing views of the hollywood sign. the organised transport and trips are really helpful to avoid public transport getting around la and to meet others in the hostel. the room wasn't the cleanest but this was more likely the other occupants than the hostel itself. overall a good stay! 
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a private room, was clean and close to everything"
Colombia,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,loved it! totally recommended
China,Male,25-30,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"i booked a 6-bed room, but was given a 8-bed room. very chaotic. some drunk people were walking inside the wrong room in the midnight and trying to find out their beds.  the shower and toilets are limited.  worst hostel i had.   only good thing is that it is close to walk of fame. "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,excellent place to stay. value for money. friendly staff and welcoming people. secure and safe.   recomend it to everyone 
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my sister and i only stayed at this hostel for one night but we enjoyed our stay regardless. we had a rental car and it was nice to be able to park it for free in a gated area so we didn't feel unsafe at all. checking in and out was easy and the staff were friendly and helpful.  
Taiwan,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staffs are soooo nice! everything is so good here, i stayed in a dorm which has our own bedroom and little kitchen with microwave and tablewares. the tiki garden is very nice for enjoying the sunshine! other facilities are good too, just having fun with friends. the activities are very good and enjoyable for everyone!  i have to say it's really hard to describe how great the hostel is! i really had a great time here and will go back as soon as possible! "
Ireland,Female,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,10,10,6,10,the private kitchen in dorm room was handy. the wifi was very poor
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,this place is good fun! staff are all friendly and helpful! good breakfast! chilled out atmosphere! bathrooms could be slightly cleaner but i think that may have been down to the people we were sharing a room with and not the cleaning staff! would definitely stay again :) 
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great spot, great people, great vibes.  only place to go in the small us hostel scene but they have done it well. only stayed 3 nights but 1 of them included free drinks and karaoke, for which everyone got up and about for.  breakfast was good and facilities were great. "
Chile,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,6,8,8,6,4,"the hostel have some very nice things, like pool, table tennis, basketball hoop and a complete breakfast. nevertheless the beds are awful, horrible mattres and bed sheets. also the towel had some strange dirt stains. also the atmosphere wasnt so good. maybe if you want to stay a long time in la this hostel is good for you because you will have time to use all the infraestructure, but if you want a place to sleep good this is not your place."
SouthAfrica,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,"the marketing team for this hostel deserves a promotion. the video portrayed this hostel  as a 10 out of 10 but it was definitely the most disappointing one we stayed in while in california. it did all the basics right and definitely has the potential to be a 10 but we found the rooms a bit dirty and the staff relatively unwelcoming. breakfast was pretty average, and if i were to stay in la again i would probably stay closer to the beach. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"my first hosts experience in the usa.   rooms are big, with ensuite bathroom and little kitchen.   daily drop offs are to universal studios and other attractions. cheap dinner nights a couple times a week at the hostel. nice free breakfast.   staff is very nice and helpful. however, not all of them are very knowledgeable about activities in the area or travel hacks in the us.   common area is mainly outside. amazing when the temperature is nice. unfortunately i had cold days.   great hostel !"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"food rooms with kitchen inside, breakfast is sweet and the hostel is a raid layout. old motel."
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hotel i've ever stayed at. and this is coming back traveling europe. we were greeted right away and had free alcohol with karaoke! (thursday nights) we met people from all over the world and roommates were respectful. hollywood is in my backyard but i would love to stay here once a month!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,6,10,10,10,"easy walk down to the centre of hollywood. about a 5-10 minute walk to buses and metro. have your wits about you when walking alone in the early morning/late nights - lots of homeless people living on hollywood blvd and sunset blvd. staff are very friendly and helpful. activities run by the hostel are great - when they say ""free drinks"" they mean it! free dinners provide plenty of food and breakfast is decent! room was well cleaned daily. heater kept the room nice and warm."
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is so much fun, staff is great, super friendly, walking distance to all the fun hollywood attractions, dorms have full kitchens, so many choices at breakfast, karaoke night is so much fun, best hostel i stayed at do far"
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,4,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great location if you want to see hollywood.  otherwise a pretty average hostel with limited facilities.  having cars drive around in the common area seemed weird.  considering the price, i expected more.  i would recommend the other banana bungalow in west hollywood, as i felt it was a better deal.  "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"probably the best and most relaxed/laid back hostel i've ever stayed in. couldn't recommend it high enough, from the various events and services to the atmosphere and staff. everything was great for the price!"
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,10,8,very solid choice for a budget stay in l.a. i would come here again.
France,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,10,6,"for los angeles, it's great value for money and i was pleasantly surprised! the staff was fun and super friendly, there are tons of free stuffs (free shuttle, drinks, food etc.), there is a great social atmosphere and the location is really close to hollywood bars and sights. we felt safe although it was a bit dark at night and not super lively in the immediate neighborhood. there were many storage space in our dorm. only complain, 1 bathroom for 8 people does not seem much!"
Australia,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"good location, great staff. facilities are a bit old but all good. free breakfast of cereal and toast, plenty of nightly activities and tours/shuttles."
Philippines,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent
Australia,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,6,4,6,6,2,"this is the worst hostel i have stayed in on the entire west coast (vancouver bc included). the bathroom looks like it hadn't been cleaned in about 2 weeks. the rooms were filthy as well. there was no security for your stored bags, nothing gets tagged and people can just walk in and out of the room. wifi is basically non-existent. if you're looking to plan your time in la when you're here, forget it. i had to go to a starbucks down the street to even book my train. "
India,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,10,8,6,8,"this is a good hostel, some things i liked here:  1. the hostel rooms have their own shower and kitchen, which is rare in hostel dorms  2. you can see the hollywood sign from the hostel  would recommend"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"i stayed in the jungle room - fun for a night but for more than, pay the extra and get a proper room. this is a tree house, without windows or proper walls. every time someone walks on the stairs the whole room shakes. and just outside the room is where everyone spends the night singing, drinking and talking. earplugs are a must. there is no breakfast included. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"the staff was friendly, some people around the neighborhood were kind of sketchy but i felt very safe while in the hostel. you can find sketchy people anywhere.  close to the metro, a bunch of places to get food nearby. i enjoyed the rooms, they weren't bad. it was nice having a bathroom in the room. however the beds made a lot of noise so everyone in my room was worried about waking each other up haha. however, i would definitely stay here again!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a great place for fun. very big rooms for what we paid for and definitely better than a lot of hostels we've stayed in so far in the united states. 
Australia,Female,18-24,2.9,2,4,6,2,2,2,2,"no light or plugs for bed. noise from party inconsiderate to non-partying guests. cigarette smoke filtered into room. pillow not a real pillow, more like small bag of fluff. staff unable to advise on basic transport issues (told to just look at google maps when i asked how to get to moca which is just a train trip away). staff do not listen to what guests say (key stopped working and i asked for it to be fixed - they acted like i was checking out). uncomfortable. high rating a mystery."
Australia,Female,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,loved it - perfect location and has a good la feel.  
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"extremely friendly and down-to-earth staff, who have huge knowledge about hollywood and l.a. during the three nights i stayed, there was a free dinner/drinks, and a party on the first night; free shuttle to universal studios hollywood on the second day; and free breakfast all the way through. the hotel provides a very cosy environment which encourages guests to meet and greet a variety of other guests from around the u.s. and the world, especially in the hostel rooms. extremely sociable!"
China,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"good staff, good location. "
Finland,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"i've stayed here several times and it's always good value for money in la. location is good: away from the craziest part of hollywood blvd but close to restaurants, bars, shops, metro etc. dorms are basic but good, showers and wifi great. if you have a car, the free parking (when available) is an amazing perk in la and can save you a lot of money. at this hostel you can definitely party and be sociable or just do your own thing and get some rest.

Australia,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,6,8,10,10,10,"friendly staff, good breakfast (even soy milk) good activities, bit of a walk to places, use uber. clean and comfortable."

Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"perfect place to stay, hollywood area in general is a bit run down , but all in all it was nice. really cool set up. you get a bathroom and kitchen which is great especially for the hostel. staff were great, always making sure all felt included in group excursions, would have done a lot more but couldn't afford much after already being in the u.s for 6 weeks prior. highly recommend! :)  wifi not great but hey, there's so much to do in town :) "
Australia,Female,31-40,6.3,10,4,10,4,6,6,4,"people smoking weed everywhere, homeless people outside the front door, save your money and stay else where, i couldn't wait to leave this hostel"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,i was told there were no blankets left when i arrived and the staff were not very friendly. however the shower and kitchen in the room were nice and the free breakfast was chilled. good for a short stay.
Brazil,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,"i recommend this hostel! i spent 2 days in hollywood and was very good!  the location is very close of the all turist places!  have many options to eat, shopping and other stores!   my friend and me really enjoyed!   luana"
England,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,10,6,8,"a fairly solid hostel all round. price is good for the location and has good facilities, clean rooms and friendly staff. more effort could be put into getting everybody together for nights out and socialising. also, having to make your own bed and sleep on a noisy waterproof mattress cover is a joke and should be changed. enjoyed our stay altogether. "
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"stayed here for my brothers 21st for 5 nights. good vibe, oddly enough during the week rather than weekends. make sure you're there on wednesday night (free beers &amp; karaoke!!) staff were really cool, especially chris ""brown"" who does the night shift - you know who you are haha! cheers guys! nik &amp; armaani "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"amazing location, party central so expect loud noise late into the night. everthing you need provided!!"
Australia,Male,31-40,6.9,6,8,8,6,6,8,6,"it's a basic establishment in a seedy area of los angeles.  the staff are moderately helpful, but the rooms lack not only character but cleanliness and character.  the breakfast, however, is decent, and there's plenty to go around.  the environment is conducive to socialising, though, and meeting other travellers.  during the day, the surrounds are okay (although they befit only a certain variant of travel limit to a minute shoestring budget).  it was okay for a one-night stay.    "
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,6,10,10,"very nice room, it has private bathroom and kitchen, good for the price. not all the staff were as friendly as we expected. atmosphere was great. "
Canada,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"the hostel is overall nice but it has a weird set-up. it's a converted motel so all the rooms circle a central courtyard/driveway. they installed a basketball net in there, which seems like a good idea but the sound of balls banging is very loud and they don't have rules about when people can play. so basically, nice hostel but not for the light sleeper."
USA,Female,25-30,6,6,2,6,8,6,8,6,"i did not feel safe here. my first night staying here (i had a private room), someone walked up to my window and tried to peer in through the curtain for several minutes, and jiggled the window. it was terrifying. i went to talk to the front desk management and described what happened, and she thought i had been saying on the first floor. she said it must have been a homeless person, that they often tried to break in and steal things (!!!) do not stay here if you are a woman traveling alone."
Mexico,Female,18-24,6.3,2,8,8,6,6,8,6,"we reserved a private double room, where they say that you pay for room and not for bed, but they asked us to pay for the extra people without telling us before. the worst thing is that the weather was cold and they didn't have enough blankets so we spend the night freezing, i also saw a cockroach in the bathroom. i definitely won't spend another night in that hostel."
Chile,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,10,4,10,frendly staff and clean rooms. my single complaint is the noise levels late   at night. through the ventilation ducts i could hear the loud laughs of other guests.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,4.6,2,4,8,2,6,4,6,"the only nice part of this hostel was oscar, the receptionist that greeted us. everything was okay, but there was one night where the ""maintenance"" guy came into our room, which we assumed he changed the paintings on the wall (even though they seemed perfectly fine) and to paint a door. there was no prior notice of maintenance and no one gave us notice afterwards either. we only found out when we came back and our room lights were on and left blue masking tape on a nightstand. "
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great place to stay - close to attractions in hollywood, clean rooms and friendly atmosphere. good value for money. "
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"the location was really good, though the staff were travellers rather than locals, so their answers to questions were often to look it up online which is not excellent.  the kitchen facilities are not great if that was what you were after."
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,10,8,8,10,"good place for the money. it is very well located, the rooms are very clean and spacious, and the people there are really nice. there were just a few things that i hoped would have been different. the breakfast was very basic, which is understandable for the price that we were paying for the rooms. one staff member was pretty rude with me, because i didn't understand his question. there were a few sketchy people there, even a homeless guy that was asking for me and my friends personal info."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,8,10,"stayed here as a first stop on my backpacking trip. arrived at about 8am from lax and they let me store my bag and have free breakfast, which was appreciated. the rooms were a good size and clean. i loved that our room had a mini kitchenette and dining table - i've never seen this before. walking distance to the metro and is on the same street the walk of fame, chinese theater etc is on so is in a great location. great social atmosphere if that's your thing. i'd stay again."
England,Couple,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"overall very good place to stay. great room and bar. fantastic location, all staff super friendly and helpful. only downside was that the wifi was terrible."
Turkey,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,8,8,"pros: friendly staff, events, location, atmosphere  cons: there is an ongoing high-pitch sound all around (and in) the hostel that may or may not bother you"
Switzerland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6,6,8,8,8,4,4,4,"the location is great and the rooms are big enough. but when we arrive, they were over booked so we had to get another room, then change again the day after. they say the manager will give us a discount for that inconvenience, but it never happened: the manager was never there. the bathroom wasn't that clean. the rooms have heating, which is great during winter."
India,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic place for international students to stay at when in la! great atmosphere and chill crowd. friendly staff and good amenities!
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"my travel buddy and i enjoyed our stay at banana bungalow. we stayed in a private room, and found that it suited our needs perfectly. i was larger than i expected, clean, and comfortable. it seemed as though the management understands their clientele fairly well and does their best to provide a decent experience for everyone. from the laid-back staff to the readily available amenities i felt like banana bungalow is a great find for any young person hoping to explore l.a. "
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,8,6,would be a rad place to stay minus the cockroaches in the bathroom. staff very friendly and accommodating. location is just touching out the outskirts of dodgy but building very secure. 
Australia,Female,18-24,6,6,8,8,6,6,4,4,great location but extremely noisy if the hostel has an event on which is annoying when you have early morning commitments. lots of free transport although we had to wait over 45mins for a shuttle bus to the griffiths observatory we ended up getting an uber instead - so don't fully rely on them to be on time but can't really complain for a free service. the common area is a car park which is a bit pointless in the winter. 
HongKong,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,6,10,10,value for money!  good location  friendly staff. 
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"all staffs are very kind and location is pretty good as well. but this hostel has a party at night, so it is a little noisy. it is a good hostel for sure as long as you dont mind noisy outside at night"
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"i didn’t stay here for long &amp; i was jet lagged so i didn’t get involved in the group activities. the staff seemed friendly, the breakfast was good &amp; it was clean. as a female solo traveller, i didn’t feel safe going out on my own in the dark. the location is ok but there’s a lot of homeless people around at night &amp; people with mental health issues (not that i’m judging - just for personal safety &amp; the stories i heard). overall, it was good. "
Greece,MixedGroup,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,8,10,"very good, parking and breakfast included. though a bit expensive and sometimes a bit too noisy"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,"overall a decent stay. right on hollywood boulevard, staff were friendly and they had cheap dinner nights and yummy included breakfast. overall atmosphere was a bit off for me, and i probably wouldn't stay again.  "
India,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"its a bit shady but that's part of the whole vibe, i guess. its on hollywood boulevard at the center of all the action. hostel activities are good and covers things to do in hollywood and la. i had fun there so i would recommend it."
England,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"we had a pretty good stay at banana bungalow, it was in a brilliant location. you could walk five minutes down the road and be at the metro station, making it easy to get to different locations in the los angeles area. the evening activities were fantastic. for example the first night we were there we paid $15 each for all you could eat lasagne, unlimited drinks and free club entry! however on the other hand if you want a quiet night these activities can be quite annoying, they're very loud. "
Canada,Female,25-30,5.1,6,6,6,4,4,6,4,"this is a party hostel - don't stay here if you want quiet evenings. nobody showed me around and i was sent to a full room of people upon arrival because the records were wrong. i had no blanket  for the first night and the staff did not seem concerned. i was told to hurry back the next day at 2pm because the blankets go quickly. when went to the computer room someone was sleeping in it. better security organization and ""caring"" from the staff would help. a communal backup washroom would be nice"
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,6,10,10,6,excellent staff! everyone was very friendly. each room has it's own bathroom but the bathrooms kind've suck. it takes forever to get hot water (although it was the same at another hostel so i'm not sure if it's an la thing.) decent breakfast. the pillows and bedding are the worst of any hostel i've ever visited....they're that bad! they have great deals on meals/drinks/club.    location is right off the walk of fame (or whatever that sidewalk is called).    
Netherlands,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an amazing time staying the hostel! i met some of the interesting and cool people i've ever met anywhere! the hostel also offers all kinds of cool free stuff like comedy nights, parties and trips. the location was great as it was close to a lot of touristic sites. the staff were very chill and friendly and everything was perfectly clean. it was simply an amazingly chill place to stay!"
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,6.6,8,10,8,6,6,6,2,it is not too far from hollywood/vine station. just bit cold at night. ask for more blanket. i saw a cockroach in the kitchen.. the breakfast wasn't good. overall was ok if u wanted to save some money
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was fantastic.  it is on hollywood blvd (from the street, you can see the hollywood sign) about a 10-minute walk from the museums and theaters.  i had stayed at the lax hostel (adventurer/backpackpackers paradise) and santa monica hostels and banana bungalow was in the middle price-wise.  it was clean and secure but maintained a laid-back party vibe.  the staff were kind and helpful with my changing itinerary.  best hostel in hollywood "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"vegan friendly breakfast!  positive: en suite kitchen w fridge, stove, plates, and table area. en suite bathroom. hostel provides many fun &amp; free/cheap activities. i felt like i was at a resort with all of the activities, and the friendly staff. fire in outside communal area.  if you don't want to party there are many of quiet spaces to relax, play pool, internet rooms.  location is accessible to buses, subway, lax shuttle (flyaway)  negative: metal bunk beds. bath in room 219 drained slowly."
Australia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,great place to stay. very clean. each room has its own kitchen complete with fridge and microwave. only problem i had was surly staff member on the sunday morning. wouldn't smile. didn't want to help. all of the others were fantastic. free tea and coffee all day. wifi good
Switzerland,Couple,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,"the hostel is close to the hollywood blvd, which is really nice. also the staff was ok but when we arrived around 5am in the morning, the man didn't really help us to get a room or anything. this was so annoying because it was cold and too early to do anything. after we got a room around 10am after asking another guy we shared one bed for two hours to take a nap. but unfortunately it was freezing in the room even if there is a heater."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"very nice staff. great atmosphere and great location. the rooms are great with a kitchen and a bathroom and they have a pool table, basketball hoop and more. they really encourage socialisation. good breakfast. "
England,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,8,8,6,10,6,"a good atmosphere at this place ,  lots of things organised by the staff, and is a good location for the hollywood area. the only thing i didn't like was the darkness of the place , poor lighting in the outside common areas and the wifi didn't stretch to the rooms "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"i had a great time here! made some friends and had an awesome night in la. the staff are great and friendly, the atmosphere is great and i would definitely recommend it!"

Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,10,"good hostel.  location was a bit far away, but most backpackers usually are.   good for what it was.  free rides to universal / disney much appreciated, and free breakfast in the morning was a delight!"
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really cool place in decent spot along the boulevard. great facilities with nightly activities.. really easy to meet ppl as a single travellor. will def  stay again when in la
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,8,8,"recently stayed here for 5 days. it was in a low season area and there weren't a lot of people until the last night i was there. but the staff are terrific, tom cooks gordon ramsey-esque tasting dinners every couple of nights. there is nothing bad to say about this place."
Slovakia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"vanja on reception was perfect. tell him my ""spasibo""  next year we shall come again."
Germany,Couple,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"we stayed here during thanksgiving and probably that was the reason why it was relatively expensive but still much more affordable than any hotel around. the private room was spacious, the bathroom clean, only the (private) kitchen could need some ""update"". the hostel was busy, many young people around and there were loud activities in the evening (bar, karaoke, etc.) but that's what i expected from a hostel, ha ha. staff was very friendly and helpful, the location perfect."
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i had a great time at the banana bungalow hollywood. it was nice and i could go there another time. the only problem i had was the parking because it was full all the time. the parking lots at hollywood seems to run only till 2am... to overnight i could not find any. great location, nice staff. the breakfast was good but i prefer to use the  kitchen in the room that i stayed.

Turkey,Female,25-30,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,great with fun and breakfast included in the morning! 
USA,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,my girlfriend and i stayed in a private room with a little kitchen that was nice. the water pressure in the shower was super low so we ended up using the bowl a bath method. other than that the hostel was accommodating. no a/c so thankfully we were in la when it was cool out. very open courtyard conducive for meeting people. close to everything.  
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,10,10,8,8,8,6,8,"when i first arrived the lady at the counter was rude and insisted to  charge us extra and told us we would have to speak to a manager at a later time.   which we did, and she was lovely as were all the other staff.   i was with two other girls and we stayed in a private dorm. awesome, large room.   ara, boogie and nial were awesome at getting everyone's vibes up! 100% recommend this hostel. "
England,Couple,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,8,10,6,"there was a great atmosphere in this hostel, everyone was really friendly including staff. it was a great place to meet other travellers. the only thing i would say is that the place is a bit tired looking. it could do with a bit of a makeover. also it would have been nice to get a proper duvet at night instead of just a sheet."
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,6,10,8,8,"it is a good hostel, staff friendly and the rooms are ok. the lockers on the rooms can be improved because some are bigger than other and this causes guests to leave the clothes on the floor.    the tours and transportation facilities are great as los angeles is quite big."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"love this place, second time staying here, love the basketball hoop"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,really cool set up with heaps of places to chill.  i was only there during the week and it's a pretty quiet location not really too close to the nightlife but if you want a good night be there wednesday.  i'd definitely stay here again

England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,such an awesome place to stay! has a really nice vibe during the day and in the evenings. all the staff are super friendly and are always organising events in the evenings which is great for meeting new people! the rooms are clean and tidy and even have their own little kitchen! highly recommended!! 
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,"friendly stuff, rooms were ok - clean but older, breakfast was really simple (too simple, even for a hostel), free use of the storage room and facilities (shower etc.) before and after check in and check out."
Portugal,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i am giving this a straight 10 of 10. this was one of the best times of my life!  i came to this hostel, right after staying at a nice hotel in las vegas. the banana bungalow hollywood blows any ""fancy hotel"" in vegas out of the water! the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is great, my god: the night program is unbeatable! stretch limousine to a downtown club, with a stopover at another banana hostel - including drinks and snacks! best breakfast ever (including nutella!). great people! love you!"

Australia,Couple,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great location! super friendly staff. we only stayed one night but loved that they had so many organised activities everyday &amp; cheap $5 meals on offer. cool little chill out area/garden. rooms have ensuite &amp; small kitchen with dining room, fridge, microwave, stove top etc. awesome!  only complaint was it's a bit noisy with road traffic &amp; beds are very squeaky but you just need good ear plugs. would definitely stay again.

Netherlands,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"nice vibe. lovely breakfast. clean bathroom, only the bath was not emptying quickly, which was kind of disgusting... they use plastic cutlery and cups, not good for the environment! "
Ireland,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"as a solo traveller, i was very pleased with my stay here. booked a private room which was spotless when i arrived. i had housekeeping come change my bathroom towels most mornings. housekeeping staff were lovely, friendly and very helpful (whislt doing my laundry) these guys deserve a pay rise! :)    the atmosphere was relaxed and there was always lots of activities planned everyday. reception staff were great and very helpful. i will be returing upon my next visit to la. thanks guys!"

USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i arrived about 8:30 in the evening, worn out.  i was greeted with cheerful helpful staff.  it was sunday and they prepared a special meal for the meager price of $5.00.  we got a giant plate of great food.  there is no elevator, but my stuff was taken upstairs for me.  my room had a small kitchen, sparely stocked, there is large kitchen,  really hot water, air conditioning.  the bunk beds had great mattresses, with protective covers.  bed linen and a towel are provided.

England,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"fantastic hostel, on hollywood blvd, plenty of decent places along in the area, 1 block from metro. free parking (seems to be plenty)   secure, looks fantastic (though the rooms could do with an updated paint job) even a kitchen in your own dorm room.   plenty of atmosphere if you want it, or a tiki lounge out back which is more chilled out.   "
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice location, and have parking, wonderful bathrooms :), free breakfast"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"rooms were cleaned regularly, $5 dinners every other night which were delicious, guest were quiet. every other night there was generally loud music playing that could be heard from the rooms but usually finished by about 11/12pm anyway. area felt safe enough. a single young women travelling by herself there was plenty of lighting on the outside street and feels a lot safer than proper hollywood. still would be cautious but generally pretty good. "
China,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"good location, an easy walk to the walk of fame &amp; a not so difficult trekking to the griffith observatory, breakfast a bit late starting at 8am &amp; quite basic, top bunk bed not easy to access, bunk bed quite shaky &amp; creaky, in-suite kitchen/dining area a bit inconvenient as some people were cooking after 9pm while the others in bed already"
Netherlands,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"good value for money hostel at a good location.  parking is a really nice feature  room (we had a private) was a bit dated but had everything and was clean    breakfast can be better. next to toast with jam/peanut butter and oatmeal it would be nice to offer a bit more (e.g. eggs/tostadas with cheese, yoghurt) there is one personen doing the breakfast shift. he/she could easily do a bit more."
Argentina,Female,25-30,4.3,2,6,8,2,2,8,2,"says it has parking, the reality is that they have few places to the number of people who get and you always have to leave the car outside.  cleaning leaves much to be desired.   the shower water goes or cold or very hot and varies alone.   the tub lid continuamemte.  breakfast is very poor and very few options.  the staff always attends with bad vibes.  you do not have plug next to the bed.  no place to store your suitcase.  we went to many hostel around the world and never one as bad as this  "
England,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,8,6,"atmosphere was good and you could make friends easy. the rooms were a bit of a weird set up, having to cook, shower and sleep together all in very close quaters. would have been good if there was a communal kitchen as that provides a social space. no aircon so it got pretty damn hot in the room as it was 36 celsius out. the breakfast wasn't great, firstly all cups and plates and cutlery were disposable which is bad for the environment. nothing was covered or refrigerated=bad food safety"
Canada,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"the banana bungalow was excellent for my visit to hollywood.  great atmosphere and friendly staff.  decent continental breakfast and good people about.  was in the perfect location for my jaunts to the hollywood sign, the hollywood bowl, and the sunset strip.  thank you b.b.!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,4.3,4,2,6,4,6,4,4,they took my things out of the room while my stay and end it up loosen my necessarie! only found when i was already on my way to another city. i'm very unhappy with this  whole thing because i had to spend money buying things like toothbrush and lotions that i cannot stay without. they don't have parking for everybody. the room is very noisy. not very clean. there's no plugs for everyone. also the breakfast is very simple. it's not worthy.

Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,great facilities and excellent location!! staff were really friendly and helped me book tours and organised free shuttles for me. only negative was i was the only girl in a 6 bed mixed dorm. 
Belarus,Male,25-30,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,8,"it's located on noisy hollywood blvd but in a quiet zone of it, so you will be able to sleep if you're sensitive. the hostel is an old motel and looks realy cool.  there was one thing i didn't like. i've checked in there twice during a week, and both times different receptionists after giving me the key didn't give me bed linen and a towel which are included in the price. i had to come back and personally ask about it. other people i stayed with  had to do the same."

Ireland,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"this place is perfectly located on hollywood blvd, like a 2 minute walk from the walk of fame. there's a different theme for every night of the week, movie nights etc. i stayed here for four nights but i wished i could have stayed more as i met a lot of like minded people from all corners of the globe! staff are very friendly and helpful and also the hostel is very clean. my particular room was more like a little apartment with a neat kitchen and fridge! i wish more hostels were like this! :)"

USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was my first experience in a hostel and in the hollywood area. the staff was super helpful and the others staying in the hostel were wonderful people. highly recommended.

Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"good hostel, rooms are big and clean, beds are comfortable and showers are good. location is not close to the beach (not a fault, just a heads up) but hostel offered a bus on the weekend to take you there (make your own way back). just be warned as by public transport, beach is aboit 1 and a half hours away!   they offered cheap and good sized dinners on some nights and breakfast in morning is good and sufficient.  nice way to end or start a trip!"

England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,6,8,6,8,8,"not a bad hostel at all, rooms were nice if a little warm, and quite a walk from public transport links as well as being in quite a rough area, but overall if wanted a cheap bed in hollywood id stay again!"
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place was awesome. i&amp;#39;ve stayed in a lot of hostels and this might be one of the best. i was station in an 8 bed dorm and the dorm had two separate rooms so it was more like staying in a four bed. not only that but there was a kitchen and bathroom in the dorm. i&amp;#39;ve never seen that before and it was amazing. they also has a great breakfast in the morning and lots of fun events to attend. not to mention, you can&amp;#39;t beat free parking. it was also a block away from the stars so perfect location. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,8,10,"good hostel to meet and chill with people if you were a solo traveler like me or with friends. events at night could have been better advertised; i didn&amp;#39;t know anything was going on until i asked explicitly. good facilities and things to do (basketball, foosball, ping pong, etc.) otherwise, it was clean, safe, and in a pretty good location (i could easily uber to anywhere from there).

Egypt,Male,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,10,10,8,8,i enjoyed my stay there  but there was only one drawback as i forgot my shoe in my room and when i called to ask about it they didn&amp;#39;t seem to care much or call me back saying if they found out or not. 
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,8,8,"everything was good however the only downside is the parking, its first come first serve,  if u don&amp;#39;t make back before they fill up u have to find a place to park on the street and the parking in hollywood is horrible!!!!, the second day we left the car parked at the hostel and took the metro. overall i can say i was satisfied.

NorthernIreland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,10,8,banana bungalow is a great place to go for young travellers. it has a fantastic atmosphere and everyone chats to you and the staff are friendly. there are great facilities and the breakfast provided is very good. they provide activities and nights out which is excellent and overall i had a great stay. 
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.1,10,8,8,8,4,6,6,a member of staff  with black hair and a pony tail messed up a booking for the celebrity house bus tour.the next day when ready to go we were told there was no tour.we had to walk 4k to another office to sort another tour.that member of staff had a really bad attitude.the rest of the staff were quite helpful and friendly.

Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great great time
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,"whilst i wasn't blown away by this hostel i certainly wouldn't mind staying again. my 6 bed mixed dorm could have done with an extra fan or 2. it was nice to have a kitchen in the room even though i didn't use it myself. for some reason there was air conditioning in the kitchen- i was tempted to move my mattress! there was a cool vibe to the place, great for a session! the ensuite was a plus but could do with a facelift. shutout to the van driver though!   all in all i would recommend to others."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"my review really is a 10/10 but i had to knock security. while the gates to parking and the front pin pad are secure i feel like anybody could let anyone in at any time. but that didn&amp;#39;t really phase me because that&amp;#39;s true of any hotel. when checking out, they said they&amp;#39;d hold our bags. which was great! but they didn&amp;#39;t tag the bags or anything so i feel like anyone could&amp;#39;ve gone in my bags and taken whatever without anyone knowing who or when. that was the only downside to this place!    "
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,i loved the activities that the hostel organised! this hostel is great if you want to meet people and explore la.
Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location. really nice staff, cool activities"
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,great location for where i needed to go.having a kitchen as well as a bathroom in the dorm was a welcome plus.the crowded conditions were to be expected;it only got on my nerves when my bunk mate started snoring.
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,"funky hostel. parking is free, but usually fills up before 8 pm. has ac, though still warm in the rooms. nice relaxing common area. fairly clean. kitchen in each room. area somewhat dodgy, but close to the main attractions. "

USA,Female,41+,8,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,"very chill environment. especially in the courtyard in the evening. met some really cool people.  it felt like a little village. the  roorm was cool, set up like a mini apartment. full kitchen and bathroom.  the only issue that was irratating was the water. while taking a shower the temperature would change, throughout.  and the sink&amp;#39;s knob were missed labeled. the cold was really the hot. overall my stay was good. i&amp;#39;d do it again."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,"had a great time here, really good vibe, i had a friend but it would be perfect for solo travelers, lovely helpful staff and good to have bathrooms connected to bedrooms. not the biggest fan of the area though.. not much there but i think that&amp;#39;s just hollywood for you"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the value for money is unbelievable, all rooms seem to be equipped with their own bathrooms which is nice. they did just a great job remodeling the old motel, the place is filled with loads of outdoor areas to hangout, you feel like your in a tropical oasis, not on hollywood blvd. the staff are friendly and fun and do a great job of always scheduling nightly activities whether is comedy shows or taco night and karaoke. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,this is definitely party hostel. if you are trying to sleep early you won&amp;#39;t be able to do there as parties continue till 3 am.
England,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,10,6,first hostel i have stayed in but really enjoyed it. it's a party/friendly atmosphere and the location is good if you want to explore hollywood 
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,it's very well located and quite big the hostel.. i missed a kind of common area to meet people but i would stay again there.
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,8,great hostel overall but be careful if you&amp;#39;re planning on parking here. they have a strange policy where even though give out more parking permits than parking spots so if you don&amp;#39;t he in/back early enough you won&amp;#39;t have a spot and will be forced to park in the street or pay for parking.
Denmark,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great place near all the crazy hollywood stuff. i don&amp;#39;t much care for the party atmosphere of the hostel, but for those who do like that sort of thing it&amp;#39;s a great place. the walls seem pretty thin as you can hear every game of beer pong in great detail. but super place!"

Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"awesome location, met some awesome people who i still speak with today would recommend to anyone!"
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"well the wifi is dreadful. prepare yourself for constant reconnecting and needing 4 hours to watch a 25 minute tv show.  but it&amp;#39;s been the best hostel i&amp;#39;ve stayed at this summer. free shuttles around town, free shuttles to nightclubs, live bands, free drinks, free breakfast, ping pong, karaoke, satelite tv and with hollywood literally on your doorstep, you don&amp;#39;t even need wifi. so make friends and have a blast. i did. they look after you so well here."
Brazil,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel! the common areas are so great and it was one of the best places i&amp;#39;ve been to make friends! too bad it was for just a little time.
India,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,8,10,10,"easy access to hollywood walk of fame, disney studios and universal studios. good security and friendly staff. parking spots are not available later in the day as they are first come first serve. but overall a good setup."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff is super friendly, as well as very helpful and easy to locate should you need something. can&amp;#39;t beat the location - it&amp;#39;s walking distance to most of the major attractions, metro stops, and grocery stores.     the facilities are great and they host events multiple times a week with discounted/free meals and fun parties."
Australia,Male,41+,6,8,6,4,6,6,6,6,"stayed at better hostels, but tiki garden was the highlight. would i stay here again?  nup !"
Austria,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"convenient location close to the highway as well as the metro. rooms were clean and had bathroom, kitchen and refrigerator. a couple times a week the hostel offers cheap dinner (usually some pasta) in the evening which was awesome. parking is limited, and it is a bit annoying that you have to hand the car keys to the staff (although you can get them 24/7 if you need to leave/access your car)."
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"look no further. this hotel, turned hostel has everything you need. it&amp;#39;s centrally located to attractions and public transport. when i arrived i was greeted and checked in my a friendly staff. the room was spotless and had everything i needed. i would 100% stay here again.

Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,10,4,"i was really lucky with my roommates! they were awesome and we had a great time. the staff were really friendly and offered me an early breakfast, because i had to leave before breakfast. even tho it's not that clean its location is very central and great to access. all in all i had an amazing stay!

Argentina,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,it may be the best hostel of the city for young people. 
England,Female,18-24,7.4,10,6,8,10,4,8,6,"very nice hostel, the breakfast was great and it seems like they encourage activities and socializing which is good but sadly i was only there for one night, but i would definitely stay again! "
USA,Couple,18-24,7.4,6,10,8,8,8,4,8,"this hostel is a converted motel and includes parking that felt safe, we had a private room which included a private bath and kitchen, which was nice even included dishes and pots. location was nice we spent a day and walked down hollywood blvd. worst thing about this hostel was that they had chairs and ashtrays by all the doors so we had groups of other people outside our beds smoking at night making it unpleasant for us nonsmokers they should move them away from our bed"
Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"conveniently located a few blocks away from hollywood/vine metro station, and centrally located with easy access via public transit to most tourist attractions and sightseeing. very lively and loads of events, perfect for a more social traveller or solo travellers looking to meet others with whom to hang out/explore."

Australia,Couple,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,hostel was overall a good experience. lots of activities to take part in. all staff were really accommodating. location was pretty good just don't head east on hollywood boulevard bit of a sketchy area. beds were a little hard but apart from that we had a great stay :)
Germany,Couple,18-24,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,2,"our experience at this hostel was influenced more on the dorm mates we shared the room with. though not all were, there were individuals who were inconsiderate. one person kept going in and out of the room until early morning (the hostel is in hollywood, so understandable if they went partying), but the other individual made so much noise, walking around the room at all hours of the night doing who knows what, farting, and using tv/radio, opening/closing doors/cabinets. couldn&amp;#39;t sleep at all. "
Argentina,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome!! just awesome hostel.. the atmosphere is great, the guys at the reception are very cool and friendly.. rooms are fantastic, with their own kitchen with fridge, microwave.. location is great too.. i would definitely stay again there"
Poland,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,10,6,6,8,"staying in this hostel was a really good experience, especially considering location and its relation to the price. bathrooms assigned for each room were something exceptionally positive; prices in the vending mashines were also quite low. i only regret that it was not so full during my stay, hence the atmosphere wasn&amp;#39;t that great."
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,wonderful hostel from the moment i entered the gates to the moment i reluctantly left!
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,8,8,8,6,6,"activities were great and the bus driver (can't remember his name) was so great, just a really funny guy. free breakfast was a nice inclusion. bit of a strange hostel vibe as it is also part hotel, and there seem to be lots of people 'living' there looking for work etc. overall great location, area wasn't shady at all, close to everything you need including public transport. staff were always friendly, only main downside was the lack of power outlets, but you can get by "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"this place was awesome. if you&amp;#39;re looking for 5-star dining and room service, this might not be the place for you. but that takes nothing away from this adorable abode. the staff is super friendly and welcoming, and the inclusive environment allows you to get to know all the other guests that are staying there as well. whenever i visit la i plan on staying here every time! xo"
Colombia,Male,31-40,6.9,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,"the hostel is just ok. old rooms, but 15 blocks away from the action on hollywood blvd. they offer free parking, which is great, but is also limited, we had to park on the street in one of our 2 nights. good breakfast.   "
Wales,Male,18-24,8,10,4,8,10,8,10,6,"had an amazing week at banana bungalow, really good social areas to meet a lot of people from around the world.   the only real negative was security as one or two people got in the hostel and stayed for a couple of nights without payment. but other then that i would highly recommend staying here. its right on hollywood boulevard so you are already right in the mix of the la lifestyle. its perfectly situated and the staff do a great job of bringing everyone together. great week! thank you!  "
Brazil,Female,25-30,3.7,6,2,6,2,6,2,2,"i had a very bad time at this hostel. only mixed dorms when i booked, very disrespectful guys, i had to ask to change rooms every night. bathroom where groos, the water wouldn&amp;#39;t keep the heat..  same as carpet. the food was good but that&amp;#39;s it. i&amp;#39;ll never recommend this place to a friend."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great place. awesome location and value for money, unfortunately there were this strange guy in our room, very unpolite and impatient like he was the owner of the room. except that, we had a perfect time during our stay in this hostel, and in the following night, there was this awesome karaoke night. i would certainly stay in this hostel again if i come back to la."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,awesome hostel.  a lot of party and amazing people. great property and very clean rooms and the location is very nice too. 
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"free breakfasts, taco dinner and free drinks for a night while we were there made it really great! especially on a backpackers budget. a short walk from the walk of fame and the metro station. really helpful staff 👍"
Australia,Couple,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if we were visiting hollywood again - this would be the place to stay. everything about it was wonderful. really liked the cheap but wholesome meals put on for guests every few days - that was appreciated.  walking distance from all main hollywood blvd  attractions, and transport. "
England,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,"i had read online that it was a party hostel but i did not expect such loud music after 11.30pm, i was on the opposite side to the bar and it was still crazy loud. this happened every night i was there apart from the saturday but instead people played basketball till really late.  it&amp;#39;s in a decent area if all you want to do is hollywood tourist stuff but bear in mind that even a 2 mile bus journey can take up to an hour!   they did have name brand stuff for breakfast though."
England,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,10,6,outstanding hostel - one of the best i have stayed in. very minor issues with cleanliness be t otherwise fine
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,this is an excellent hostel! everyone is super friendly and the atmosphere is great. free breakfast every day and $5 dinners 3 times a week were good- nothing super fancy but did the job and were also a great way to meet more people.  there&amp;#39;s a pin code to get into the hostel from the street and each dorm requires a swipe card. the only security downside was that there were only 2 full-size lockers in my dorm of 6 beds (the other 4 were just big enough for the essentials) but i always felt safe.
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,"when i stay in hostels i want to meet fun travellers.  banana bungalow was the perfect place for doing just that.  they organise events most nights (including a free shuttle to their sister hostel in west hollywood for a free burger and beer night).  the dorm room and bathroom were nothing special, but for me that didn&amp;#39;t matter as i was too busy having fun with exploring la by day and going out to amazing nightclubs of an evening.  amazing clubs: dirty laundry &amp; no vacancy (just up the road). "
USA,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel! friendly staff, walking distance to tcl chinese theater, connections at the front desk to other activities and sights. it was awesome!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i definitely loved this place. the staff was super friendly and helpful. the middle common area is the best i was always there hanging out with people and drinking beer...meeting new people and having  a great time. i highly recommend it :)
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic location, staff, security, fun, i really enjoyed my time here and i will be back :)"
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"great hostel with a lively atmosphere. only 6 to a room, each with private bathroom and kitchen was a big bonus. free breakfast in the morning was also decent. not located in the nicest neighbourhood but security was good and always felt safe. also a great hostel for meeting new people with events organised by the hostel and always stuff going on in the quad, however probably not the best place to stay if you&amp;#39;re looking for an early quiet night&amp;#39;s sleep. "
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,8,6,6,"if you&amp;#39;re looking for a hostel with a &amp;#39;partying&amp;#39; vibe, then this is the place to stay. it was fun a couple of times, but parties/gatherings happened every night in the courtyard, until late, and it did get a bit annoying and hard to sleep.   but, there&amp;#39;s free breakfast, shuttle rides to landmarks and points of interest and surprisingly cheap vending machines ($2 for vitamin water!). location-wise, this hostel is a 10-minute walk away from hollywood boulevard and you can see the &amp;#39;hollywoo"
Wales,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,i enjoyed my time at this location and i am looking forward to receiving free accommodation/vouchers from the venues in la.  they have freebie nights etc. which they can also filter through this platform.  please inform them i would be interested in the freebie accommodation also at all la venues.  this can include all hostels in the la area and venice beach/santa monica areas. please call/text at 505-459-0485.   thank you
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"this is an awesome place to stay if you want to meet awesome people and party. the events the hostel puts on including $5 dinner nights are the best. we would stay here again but i will mention that it can be quite loud until 2 or 3 am. the bunks are a bit unstable and our shower/bath did run both taps at once and on our last night bubbled up with dirt, when we told the desk they responded quickly but were unable to get maintenance out to fix it until morning. staff were super friendly + helpful"
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.6,10,10,8,8,6,8,10,"had a good experience there. it&amp;#39;s clean, have good breakfast and they drive you for free to universal studios and disney (they have a schedule). if you like parties, they have good ones, if you don&amp;#39;t usually is over by midnight, so i don&amp;#39;t see a problem... there was a tv in my room and a kitchen. quite comfortable!"
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great private room with kitchen and toilet. lovely garden outside, and nice location in hollywood boulevard."
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"banging hostel, really love this place definitely reccomend. "
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,nice hostel in a good location. bizarre to have a kitchen in room as it can make the room smell. other than that though a good experience 
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"fun vibe here, my friend and i stayed in a 6 bed mixed dorm with 4 guys. it worked out fine! there is an ac in the room and convenient outlets around the room. they played a movie late one night and it was nice to sit outside and watch! breakfast was basic and everything needed. no issues at all :) we will definitely return!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i had a good time in this hostel. simple breakfast, but with infinity nutella. nice atmosphere: there was free tacos, free beers and karaoke when i was there. good location: near hollywood hall of fame. the rooms were good and clean: for improvement, i would suggest that there were sockets near all beds. at any rate, i recommend that you stay there."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"awesome hostel! staff were really friendly, rooms were clean and heaps of activities and things to do organised by the hostel. 10 minute walk to the hollywood walk of fame. i definitely recommend this hostel."
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing, the only word needed to describe this hostel. what a great way to end my 5 weeks in the states. everything you need is at the hostel and it is in a great location. the night activities put on are great to interact with the other guests. only bad thing i&amp;#39;d say would be the shower had a mind of its own, going from hot to freezing quickly. but hey a cold shower wakes you up. i&amp;#39;ll happily book banana bungalow if i visit la again. thanks guys . "
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,4,2,6,6,4,4,4,2,"we stayed in the private room with ensuite. it was one of the loudest rooms i have ever stayed in. the ceiling seemed to be paper thin and any movement in the room above seemed to be extreme! although i&amp;#39;m pretty sure there was a dance party going above our room. all good though, it stopped at 1am, so we were able to get some sleep..... until 5am when the party started again.    not worth the money, wouldn&amp;#39;t stay again.      "
India,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,"people seemed to look creepy at times. overall a very good place to stay, hangout and make friends."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i stayed with my younger sister in a 6 bed f dorm  the location is a little out of the way from the main attractions, but public transport is available close by (both train and bus) which will get you to where you need to go.  the upside to this is that it is a relatively quiet, with minimal street noise, just the occasional helicopter (i mean, it is la)  the breakfast is basic but filling: toast with spreads, porridge, coffee, and fruit.  staff are a+, as are the shuttles offered.  would stay again!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,meet some great people here and would definitely recommend it to people in the future
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"definitely a little expensive as far as hostels go, but i suppose that&amp;#39;s hollywood for you! close to the metro line and walk of fame and great chilling area by the bar."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,10,8,6,10,8,6,6,"this hostel houses some down and out people, weed smokers, tattoo&amp;#39;s, smokers, drinkers... like one guy with full body tattoos and face inked in like nothing you have never seen before. with that said, the place is worth every $.  free breakfast, cool events during the week and staff that are awesome. it&amp;#39;s edgy, and if you like edgy and want a place that is close to hollywood. all in all, great value for money, free car park!  i would stay again. "
Mexico,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location. great staff and facilities. the rooms are big, clean and have their own kitchen and fridge. the daily activities are so much fun. "
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"i really enjoyed my 3 nights. the fact that the common room is an interior but opened to the outdoor parking lot, makes people just go outside and hangout together. at the other hostels i've bee to, everyone was going out to hang out but banana bungalow is pretty chill to hang out until whenever you want! i loved the activities that were organized and there were at leadt three per day! all the facilities that i would have expected. had a blast and made good friends."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,6,6,6,10,8,"spacious room with full amenities (kitchen, shower, toilet, tv). though the shower/tub seemed clogged, couldnt keep up with the water flow. clean rooms, helpful staff, though sometimes seems to be in their own world. location is a fair walk to anything if your there for a while. not value for money, but seems to be the norm for la hostel pricing."
India,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this place was absolutely adorable. the hostel was so pretty and the little tiki backyard is very nice. the people are very helpful and lovely! the rooms were clean and also had it&amp;#39;s own private kitchen fully-equipped with fridge, microwave and stove and a dining area! would definitely recommend. "
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,having gone to the wrong hostel initially (there are two banana bungalows in la) where we were given directions to the correct one by a helpful member of staff.  when we arrived at the correct address we were assisted by a member of staff in finding a parking space and checked in quickly which was good as it was 2am!    the room was fine and bedding was comfortable.  the free breakfast until 11am was great!  the member of staff who checked us out was really friendly too.
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,8,8,4,6,8,8,6,"you get what you pay for! it&amp;#39;s an okay location but sometimes seemed pretty far away from everything, and the streets surrounding the hostel are a bit dangerous. lots of my uber drivers warned me to be careful in the area as i was a female travelling alone. the water also smelt weird from the pipes... otherwise i enjoyed my few days here and it did the trick."
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic place to stay!all the staff were lovely and helpful. it&amp;#39;s perfect location for exploring hollywood-only 5 minute walk away from the famous walk of fame!we booked and stayed in a double private room and had our own kitchenette and bathroom.  if you do book a double room it comes with an extra single bed at no extra cost(don&amp;#39;t worry they won&amp;#39;t put someone extra in your room :) )  the only bad points of this hostel is the internet from your room is bad and the shower pressure is very low.
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first time at a hostel but it was amazing! so many activities and everything was super secure and great!

Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,i had a wonderful stay at banana bungalow hollywood at the beginning of april.   i stayed in a co-ed 8 bunk room and shared a bathroom with the other hostellers.  i had a lot planned around la and the staff at the front desk helped with bus schedules and recommended routes to my destinations.   the bathroom was fine but could get &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; considering 8 people were using it. one morning the tub was not draining- i found a wad of hair blocking the drain. once this was resolved- the water was great! 
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,4,10,8,8,10,8,"cool place, great atmosphere. security at front door seemed suspect later in the night (during one night i had to walk through multiple thug-types who were smoking inside the entry from the doorway)."

Canada,Male,31-40,8.3,10,8,6,8,8,8,10,"i enjoyed my time at this hostel. friday night was amazing as they planned a dinner and night out for the guests. cheap night out including a meal and vip entrance to a pretty good club. most of the staff were friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations. the rooms were pretty clean, but small, especially with 6 people. the lockers were also very small as you could not put much in there except a small backpack. i liked the bathroom and kitchen in the room, as that was a plus.  "
Brazil,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,4,"the staff was super great. but my friends and i stayed in differents rooms, what i didn&amp;#39;t like. the sheets were dark what i didnt like so much either. but the breakfast was aewsome! and we had parking."

Japan,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,like this place so much that we will be back!

USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,6,10,10,8,8,"the vibe here is pretty laid back. but overall, interesting and chill.    the first night i got back, my couch was replaced by a chair and table. the second night i came back, my chair and table was replaced by another couch. i didn&amp;#39;t mind, i just though that it was humorous.    i&amp;#39;ll probably be staying again."
Argentina,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,we stayed 3 nights in a comfortableprivate room with kitchen. staff was very friendly and  helpful. very good value for money. i will choose it again.

USA,Male,31-40,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,"nice spot if you&amp;#39;re looking to be near hollywood and meet other travelers. the drain in my room&amp;#39;s bathtub was continually plugged and hence mostly grimy while there. they do clean the units everyday, though. friendly staff and guests."

USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,so they messed up my reservation! for the first day only. so had to share a room when i wanted a private room with me and my brother.     they accommodated us well so that missed hap was ok.     overall the stay was good. it was nice hostel with good activities.     might stay there again in the future. 
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel so have ever stayed at and atmosphere was amazing with really good travelers and staff. the hostel was located in walking distance of pretty much everything in hollywood. i slept in a mixed dorm and everyone is really nice and respectful. none of the staff or other travelers messed with your belongings. the hostel had many events to attend each day and night which was really awesome. i actually traveled alone and had the best time of my life. i actually extended my stay 3 more days:)
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"originally booked for 4 nights but ended up taking a spontaneous trip to vegas on the first night. staff were kind enough to take the first night&amp;#39;s fee out of my booking and let me store my luggage overnight. room was spacious with a built in bathroom and kitchen! convenient location, just a short walk from the metro station, local shopping malls and food outlets. the atmosphere is very laid-back but can get a bit loud at night. great affordable accommodation, will definitely stay again!

Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"was awesome. people were so nice. good spot. free breaky. awesome set up with open courtyard. definitely recommend. we had a party at the bar area drink supplied by hostel, perfect for young people travelling. "
Sweden,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,6,8,"stayed at the hostel for four days, had a good time there. the room was clean and the staff was friendly. we had a lamp outside our window that made a terrible noice the entire night, and though it was not on the hostel property it did have a negative effect on our stay. the breakfast was average, at the level of our expectations, though it would have been nice with something a bit healthier (maybe some fruit). parking was only free if you came home early (very limited amount of spaces)."

Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"good hostel, walking distance from the main attractions. they provide shuttles to a couple places and organize activities, which is nice. bathrooms could be cleaner but oh well, it&amp;#39;s a hostel. bathrooms are shared in each room so less people in the same bathroom. nice little tiki spot with a bar."
Canada,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"very nice hostel, reasonably clean, with lots of amenities. met some cool people from all around the world and shared good laughs. wednesday nights are the most fun, with free food, drinks and a karaoke. the dolby theater's in walking distance, which is nice because we were able to go check out the oscars."
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,10,6,6,"great location, about 10-15 minute walk to good clubs and bars as well as to the main part of hollywood. a few minutes walk to the metro line if you need to take that. also, the style of the hostel is really cool, there is an open area with a basketball hoop. there are also chairs and foosball table that you can hang out and meet people. the hostel room was pretty old and not the nicest, but the rates are good. staff was also really nice and they give free breakfast."

Colombia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it&amp;#39;s a great place for young people because they have a lot of activities at night and also during the day. it&amp;#39;s safe and near to the principal activities in hollywood. they have a big truck that takes you through the city and observatories for free. the place is clean and the staff is very friendly. i will recommend it a hundred percent. 
England,Female,41+,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,close to hollywood vine and lax flyaway - good activities in evenings and v friendly helpful staff - basket ball late at night annoying!!  but handy location and great view marathon!

Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"great location, decent breakfast, helpful staff, thin pillows - only stayed for one night but would definitely go back. could have had a bit more space in rooms (6 beds to one small last room) but had its own toilet and bathroom."

Taiwan,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"staffs are really kind to help, and there are many activities to participate, though if you want to sleep early, it might be kinda noisy. others of this hostel really good! (if there are different foods in breakfast, would be better)"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,10,10,6,8,6,4,was really good. offered so many activities and social nights which are fantastic for a solo traveller. questioned the cleanliness at times. 
Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel was very well run, a lot of good extras like free breakfast as well as free taco night/free beer. the 5$ spaghetti and lasagna were very good. close to everything!"

USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"it's was what i needed for the shirt period of time i spent, however ,i wish the beds were single and not bunk beds.."
China,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,my bed is too high and it's not easy for me to climb
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,8,10,10,4,6,8,4,the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned in a while and i had to unclog the drain on my first day there in order to use the shower.
Brazil,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,6,10,8,some of the guys that work there were hitting on the girls in our group and this made them feel very uncomfortable and harassed.
Taiwan,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,8,4,6,8,6,8,6,"location isn't bad but need to take bus or uber to hollywood avenue. do not have many restaurants near by. some free activities during the night, ex: free bbq, free shuttle bus to universal studio. however, the locker in the room is useless."
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"we really much enjoyed our stay! great location, friendly staff, nice rooms and good price, and with included breakfast!"
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,6,10,8,8,10,"one of the better hostels i've stayed in. they have great free facilities and the rooms are big and clean. there is a kitchen and bathroom in the room which is awesome! the location is all right, even though you're staying on the hollywood blvrd it's still a half an hour walk to downtown hollywood."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,this hostel is in hollywood and its not far from the walk of fame. it is not far from bus stops or the metro.  there are also events scheduled everyday which helps keep you busy if you have no plans.
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,8,8,"a really good hostel located near the main section of the hollywood boulevard. obviously an old hotel that has been turned into a hostel which is great cause each room has a kitchen and bathroom. facilities were good and atmosphere was good for the younger crowd i suppose. can be noisy at night but they crank the music off before midnight, so all sweet."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever!!! made our stay in la unforgettable. nights out are so much fun and location is perfect. lots of activities and free shuttle around the city. good breakfast with nice varieties! will always come back there when i got to la!
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"great ambient and common areas, i stayed at some other hostels during my trip but for some reason people in this one seem to be more friendly and party people. great location for the most touristic attractions in  los angeles. the breakfast was one of the most complete i get during my trip also."
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nothing to complain about. i even decided to stay an extra day.
Denmark,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,6,6,4,4,6,"karaoke night isn't fun for the rest of the guests not participating.   unipersonal staff in reception, but nice at breakfast"
Russia,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,one of the best hostels in usa i ever stayed.
Ireland,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,10,6,the place had great atmosphere with parties twice a week including bbq.  i liked the idea they brought you to the other hostel they have for the party and vice versa.  one thing i did not like is it wasn't clean with cockroaches climbing the walls beside where you sleep so i wouldn't be staying there again.  prefer to pay little extra for a cleaner place. 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel, very cool vibe and great nightlife activities, good location. coming into the cooler months i think you need to provide more than just sheets on the beds, it gets cold at night!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,10,6,"a fantastic hostel right in the heart of hollywood, la. every night they organized social events which even sometimes included free food, alcohol and comedy! definitely one of the friendliest group of staff members i've found. only issue was some of my friends were in a really grungy room where they fit 14 people across two connected rooms which reeked constantly."
USA,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,10,4,8,"very loud, even in your room with doors/windows closed. recommend to bring ear plugs. if you are not a partier, this is probably not a good hostel for you. it was a bad fit for me."
SouthAfrica,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,we enjoyed our stay in the hostel. it is located in east hollywood close to all the main attractions. hollywood/vine metro station is also just 3 blocks away. the rooms were nice and each one has its own bathroom and kitchen. the overall atmosphere in the social area is also great and we met quite a few great people!
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"first time in a hostel and it was one of the best experiences i've ever had. endless activities, amazing people, and great staff. will be staying here again asap "
Mexico,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"party hostel if you're looking to sleep at least 6 hours per night, do not stay here! but if you're looking for having a great time, socializing, meeting great people and partying around, this is definitely the place. all of the staff are mega friendly and fun, they do a great job. the beds are noisy and there's plenty of noise even late at night. very fun hostel. they provide 3 mac computers for us to use, they also offer some free open bar nights which are amazing and have different activities"
Norway,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent hostel in every single way!
England,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"excellent hostel with a great vibe, always something going on."
Finland,Couple,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,"it really is a party hostel with lots of activities and stuff, but the music is very very loud and it plays very late, so it's hard to go to sleep before the party is over. breakfast is just cereal and toast and coffee, and since the vending machine was broken there wasn't any bottled water in the whole place. lockers are super small and the beds are shaky. everything is ok clean and ok condition, but nothing is too special."
Spain,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,6,10,10,10,8,"great hostel to stay at. wonderful staff,facilities and atmosphere. they even let us to stay in the common room till late drinking and talking. definitely a must."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great place! on the saturday night you can pay $15 and get dropped off at another hostel for a party with free drinks (spirits and mixers!) and appetisers. i can say that i was smashed when leaving so the drinks and value for money. also gets you into a cool club downtown for free. very sociable place, very easy to meet people as there is a lot of common space. the guy with the beard at the front desk is amazing - our booking was wrong and he sorted it all out and went above and beyond for us :)"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,4,8,10,6,6,10,6,rooms have kitchen/dining areas and good size bathrooms but there is no aircon and the beds are very wobbly squeaky metal bunks wit uncomfortable mattresses.  common area does free food some nights and free drinks all night some nights as well which is incredible.  i left early because i was sleeping terribly in the heat and had a top bunk which meant everytime i moved even slightly i would make heaps of noise.
Netherlands,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,"if you come to hollywood to party, this is the place to be!. else you can better find a different overnight stay."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,6,8,10,8,10,"great location if you want to be in the middle of hollywood, was a bit hot when we stayed which made it hard to sleep as the sun sets on most the rooms. was clean and the comedy night was mint but would stay at west hollywood banana bungalow if your looking for more vibe and atmosphere."
Germany,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,"the stay was nice, such an all the people around.  the room wasn&amp;#39;t ba, you habe your own bath and kitchen, wich was very nice."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,8,8,"great hostel and a lot of fun, only negative thing for me was that the staff thought my bed was empty and gave it away to another guest and through out my towel and shorts in the process."
Lebanon,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect hostel. very large rooms with their own kitchen and bathroom. lots of common area, people are very friendly, a lot of meetups, programs and free tours. perfect location. the place to be in l.a. without any hesitation!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great hostel with a cool atmosphere! the location is ideal!  was just a little put off by the lady at reception who seemed bothered every time i asked her a question! however, how definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend to others."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,10,6,"if you plan on partying until wee hours in the morning, fine. if you want peace and quite this is not the place. parties went until 2 am,  constant roommate changes (more often then normal), over price excursions. didn't bother me as i was on vacay and had a car to do my own thing (which i strongly recommend doing). the breakfast was a joke, so don't get your hopes up. 3 types of bland cereal or bread with jelly, coffee or tea and banana or orange. -_-  no juice, so don't ask.  overall its okay."
Germany,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,8,4,"upon our departure there was one guest / employee (he had a broom in his hands) who was really obtrusive. you asked us couple of times if we can take him with us for 40 bucks and also walked infront of our car. i already saw him once i checked out in the entrance room, but the employee behind the desk just laughed at him..."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,it was a convenient place to stay for a night. easy to find and everything you needed was in your room. it was interesting though to be put in a mixed dorm full with males and being the only female - surely they would have considered it before putting me in there. but it worked out okay.
Canada,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,8,4,6,4,2,"me and my friend had done hostels in vancouver, seattle, portland, san francisco and santa barbara at this point and this was by far the worst. if your younger and just want to party and don't care about cockroaches in your room then this might be an ok place for you. we checked in at 10 and checked out a 1030 because it was so horrible. they said they would give me my money back for the inconvenience but ended up double charging me. still trying to get my money back from september..."
Lithuania,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,6,10,10,6,"nice hostel at the end of hollywood boulevard. location wise at night you can meet various types of people, looks safe but wouldn't wonder far from the main street. atmosphere at the hostel was awesome, however cooling in the room was just a warm breeze in the room. rooms large and had kitchen and bathrooms. very pleased with the stay"
Brazil,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,10,8,4,i stayed at banana bangalow west in a private room for 4. overall the hostel offers a fair value for the money and staff is really attentious; however my biggest complaint is regarding the cleanliness of the room. i had trouble with some bed bugs (3 out of 4 girls in my room had it) what caused me a big injury and marks all over my body. back to my home town i had to go to the hospital and today (1 week after my return) it is still very bad. hostel staff should give more attention to it.
Poland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel with a cool party vibe! ideal location, good breakfast, good wifi, spacious room and really friendly staff.  i'll definitely stay here again when i come back to la"
England,Male,25-30,5.7,4,6,10,2,6,6,6,definitely avoid unless you want a party hostel. 
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.1,8,4,10,4,6,10,8,"breakfast was not so good ! staff was a little unattentive, but the ambience is awesome ! great place to mwet people and party!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,3.1,2,2,6,2,6,2,2,"hostel was disgusting! we found roaches in the closet and in the bathroom and the guys were complaining about bed bugs!! seriously the dirtiest hostel i've ever stayed at and i usually don't complaint about anything.    also, the kitchen inside the rooms made for a horrible smell in the room. they advertise that as a positive thing but its not!!people were boiling chicken and the whole room smelled horrible.    def will never stay there again. be ware!"
Hungary,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"so nice i extended my stay for the rest of the week! then again, it also really depends on the company."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,"i stay with this hostel at least 3 nights everytime i come to hollywood. if you are a first time traveler, book with this hostel. the staff is so friendly and welcoming and they put together all kinds of fun nights out. if you dont meet at least 3 people who will be potential friends, you must be hiding in your room and not trying to have fun. good vibe only here! :)"
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the long hair guy who works there is so nice and friendly! i highly recommend this hostel.
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever! :)
NorthernIreland,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,really enjoyed our very first stay in a hostel!!
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"very good atmosphere. lots of young people looking to party, which was exactly what we wanted. good size room with private bathroom and kitchen."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.1,8,6,4,8,10,8,6,"excellent hostel, great facilities and party room. would go back there!"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,"i didn't exactly have the most pleasant stay - the staff were having their own conversations with others in reception while i was checking in, the breakfast was minimal, i wasn't really told about the facilities available and i came back to my room at 1am to find someone in my bed and a note on the door saying 'angela, please come to reception asap'. i had been moved rooms without notice so had to collect my stuff (which was all across the room), remake my bed etc. which was very inconvenient."
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the staff worked together to provide great service! each individual was helpful, minus the guy checking us in. breakfast was fantastic, and the atmosphere was great! i appreciated that we did not need to worry about what time we came in at night.     parking was rough. we usually had to park right next to the facility as the lot was full at night. still, definitely a secure area and worth your money.     i recommend this hostel, and i look forward to future visits."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very cool place has its own parking inside. hostel room had kitchen and bathroom. nice towels fluffy unlike most places. laundry on site and breakfast. it's near the hollywood sign. the guy who checked me in i think oscar was his name explained everything well and was cool about everything.  this is a great value one of the best i've been to.
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,very well run hostel. good events! the beds were awful though....
Greece,Male,25-30,4.3,2,4,6,4,2,6,6,"the property itself is not bad the rooms are decent and well furnished although the blinds are destroyed in most of the rooms and privacy is not present. they have a good shuttle service and decent food. however, the staff are terrible: unhelpful, rude and only interested in hitting on female guests. although there was too large a number of staff on the property (there were actually too many compared to the guests) present in the property they were not doing their job properly."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"really great place to stay! lovely staff and lovely people, great for a solo traveller. had good security and comfy enough beds with hot showers. can't complain at all!"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"easily the best hostel i've stayed at . staff were great , breakfast and dinner good and great location . will come back for sure ."
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,6,10,"hostel clean and tidy. as the rooms all have individual kitchens it's not as social as some of the other hostels i have stayed in. good amount of activities going on, and hostel organises free shuttle rides to various places too which is really good. on hollywood boulevard but will take about 30 minutes to walk to the main theatres etc. much better location than the west hollywood banana bungalows. "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love the banana bungalows!. this was my 2nd time here &amp; there is always a great vibe!. rooms are awesome with your own kitchen &amp; bathroom in a 6 person dorm. close walking distance to certain sites and easy to drive anywhere from here. breakfast included is a bonus and the day / nightly activities are great!. one of my fav hostels!. 
Austria,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"that&amp;#39;s a good party hostel! cool trips, nice staff."
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,6,6,8,4,6,2,8,"if you really need o try downtown, being on tour all day, this might be okay. else there basically atmosphere"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great atmosphere and reall good fun. staff were really helpful and they work hard to keep everyone happy and really enjoyed the different nights of entertainment they put on. and the rooms were clean and fresh. would defiantly stay there again and highly recommend any one else to
Sweden,Couple,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,the hostel was nice with good location on the end of walk of fame. the breakfast was a bit late and one day they have forgotten to order breakfast so there were nothing to eat except cereal.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,8,6,"great fun and good choice of nightlife activities, highly recommend for your la stay."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome atmosphere here.  met a lot of people here that ended up extending because it was so good.  will always stay here while in la.
Germany,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,6,6,8,6,"the hostel should change the password for the front door more often, because you get homeless and weirdos in there."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,the most important thing you have to keep in mind before booking this hostel is that it is a party hostel. there a lot of activities involving a high volume of booze. i personally liked it because it's one of the reasons why i booked it. it's a bit pricy though but hostels in la are generally expensive.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,10,8,"pretty good location, easy walking distance to public transport, which i used to get around as i didn't have a car. activities every night which were great for meeting new people! "
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,great hostel but a little out of the way. would prefer a little closer to the action of hollywood. but the hostel itself is awesome with loads of things to do. and great people to meet.
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"very nice place to stay, would definetly come back!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,didn't mind it here. i think the west hollywood is the more party one if you're looking for that.  location is just a few blocks away from the main stuff on hollywood blvd which is handy 
Brazil,Female,31-40,3.1,4,2,6,2,4,2,2,"there is no security in this hostel. apparently anyone comes and goes from there. the breakfast is very weak, they only give right to two slices of bread per person, there is no type of cheese. partying until midnight making it impossible to sleep early, however tired that a customer has. there is only one common bathroom. i divided the room with seven others people and was an inconvenience to use the bathroom of the room since there was no bathroom available outside the room."
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"well to kick off, on arrival this place was like a top night club, busy n bustling with life; you felt like this is the place i was looking for; a hostel with life and friendly people. this must be the best hostel i've experienced a party atmosphere in, made some good connections and friends for life; the day tour is fab and well worth the $35 for humor alone, big shout to armani the driver n all the team taking us on bar crawls. 5 star hostel n service... close to restaurants n transport"
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel great staff nothing to fault. will definitely be back
USA,Male,41+,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,"it's a good place to stay when you visit la with the following provisions:  you can tolerate a party hostel- with courtyard noise every night,   you can tolerate a large range of housemates. cleaning up after roomates who threw up after drinking is a regular occasion, though they were good enough people.  the rooms actually have kitchens and refrigerators in the suites, and they are kept clean enough.  they have cable tv in the suites.  the wifi works well.  filling breakfast of carbs."
Ireland,Female,18-24,9.1,8,6,10,10,10,10,10,"all over it was good but i think security could have been a little better. i know that one of my roommates had friends come and stay in the empty bunks without paying. it made me and a fellow roommate feel a bit anxious because they weren't accounted for or on the hostels records if they did anything. we probe should have reported it but we didn't want to get into anyone's bad books, still it's still an issue to consider!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,10,8,great hostel with friendly vibe and something going on each night so be prepared for a bit of noise. having a kitchen in each room is handy and the location is great for getting around hollywood. close to the metro too if you're looking to go to downtown la.  had a broken shower head in my room but after notifying staff was fixed the following day.  no complaints
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"it is an awesome hostel, but since it is right in hollywood and a bit far from west hollywood or downtown you may spend sometime riding a bus, metro or even with your car.   the staff is always busy but helpful and the atmosphere inside is awesome."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"love that there are individual kitchens and bathrooms per room. excellent activities and great location just 5 mins from the walk of fame, easy access to hiking to the hollywood sign and staff were very helpful and friendly."
Spain,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,10,8,best hostel i have ever stayed! great atmosphere!
Portugal,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,"great place to stay. the atmosphere is great and the staff very friendly. location is also great, within walking distance from the dolby theatre and the famous hollywood sign. "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is my favorite hostel by far. very cool vibes as well as kitchen inside dorm rooms. great location and entertainment during the week. i highly recommend staying here! 
Estonia,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,10,8,8,8,8,10,"it's an old motel converted into a hostel. there is a kitchen and bathroom in each hostel room which made the space very crammed, too many bunks in a tiny room! also, the kitchen wasn't best equipped, however, they offer daily free breakfast and cheap dinners on many of the nights so you don't necessarily need to cook. they organise lots of day tours and nights out, great party hostel for young people (they stop loud music at midnight so not too bad if you are interested in sleeping either)!"
Canada,Female,25-30,6.6,4,6,6,8,8,6,8,"the hostel itself is clean and secure. we had the bad luck to be in a room with the dirtiest girl i have seen. the bathroom was disgusting. we went to the office to change room, but the hostel was full. plus, there was no more bedsheet available this night.   it is a party hostel, so if you don't want any noise, choose another place. it's located 10 minutes away from the subway station, in the middle of hollywood boulevard."
Australia,Male,18-24,4.6,2,8,10,2,2,6,2,all but one member of the staff ( i would name him if i knew what it was) were so much more interested in their own problems/ stuff  didn't seem to want to help when required  the fact that the main communal area was also the carpark and the only place you could smoke made it difficult to enjoy the stuff the hostel had to offer. the large rooms were good but the beds were still jammed together  the only good thing i can see about this hostel was the fact it was so close to the walk of fame etc.
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"had a nice time. good breakfast, nice rooms and cool common area."
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place! good party!!
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,6,10,8,6,10,6,8,"staff are friendly and the hostel is located within short walking distance to most of the sites in hollywood. my only complaint for this hostel is the noise level. although i was staying in la on a friday night, the party went on in the center courtyard until the early hours of the morning with music blaring and bass pumping. great pick depending on your reasons for passing through la; for me it didnt entirely match up."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,10,8,a good hostel that becomes a sort of night club on weekends so a great party hostel if you're into that. free booze on weekends too!
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,good location and friendly staff. also they gave us lots of things for traveler! this hostel is kind of pricey. but they have nice breakfast and good sociality area! 
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,10,10,8,8,"i loved my stay at this hostel! the room and the bathroom was really cleaned. the breakfast was okay, not a lot of options, but it's a hostel... it was maybe a little bit far from the main attractions on hollywood boulevard, but after you figured out how the transportation works in l.a., you should be fine!    just one thing : a staff member told us that the greyhound station in downtown l.a. was really closed to the subway exite, but it was at least 15 blocks away. we almost missed our bus..."
Germany,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"nice place in an amazing location (2 min walk to walk of fame), lots of free food (nutella for breakfast :) !), spacious rooms and helpful staff. would go there again!"
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel i have ever been too !  there was nothing negative and i just loved it !!   the activities are great there !   if you are in la, go there !!"

China,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,10,8,4,"the hostel is very close to the walk of fame, but also sufficiently away from all the actions, so not too noisy. the staff are helpful and kind. i didn't stay for too long, but i noticed there were washing facilities, and a kitchen in the room. the only problem is that the room smelled a little bit funny (but that's what happens when you are sharing the room with a bunch of people i guess...), and there were an army of cockroaches to greet you in the bathroom and the kitchen."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a great hostel! they had so much to offer like bbq's, tour's and much more. it was a very relaxed atmosphere and i felt like i had gotten to know everyone so well!"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"was a fine place to stay. it is a fair walk down the boulevard to get to west hollywood but that is to be expected. don't get confused between the hollywood and west hollywood bungalows. both are fine, but west hollywood had better parties."
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,good friendly hostel something on every night staff are great would deffo stay again

Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,10,8,"very convenient location. close to highway for travel to universal and beaches, prime spot for the hollywood walk of fame.  there was night activities at the hostel every night."

Mexico,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,10,8,"this place is really well located, clean and with a good atmosphere. it has wi-fi and common areas so it is really nice to be around. can't wait to come back."

Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is great! people are nice and the rooms clean with kitchen and bathroom. my favourite hostel by far, recommend it!"
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,is a place more likely for youth. awesome atmosphere
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"had a great time at the banana bungalow, there was heaps of opportunities to make friends and they had a wide range of activities to sign up for at a great price. lots of free dinners and beer, would recommend especially to a single traveller or if you don't have a car as they do lots of trips to popular spots on the cheap"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay at banana bungalow. very chill and relaxing environment and the staff was super nice and friendly! would come back here again!

Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"very friendly and always helping staff, the dinners are amazing and so are the social events at night!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay - clean, comfortable rooms with lots of included activities"
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i booked a 4-bed room but realized that there are in fact 2 rooms linked together to share one bathroom and a kitchen. it's nice to have a tv in the room but sometimes it can be noisy if people in another room are chatting and watching tv. it is convenient to go to nearby metro station and only 2 metro stations away from universal studios.
Bangladesh,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,"great location in hollywood, next to metro station and all iconic things of hollywood are within walking distance on the same street. facilities are clean, staffs are friendly. nice hostel"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"could not recommend this hostel more, i had the best time here, everything is amazing, except could do with a swimming pool and duvets in winter! big shout out to armani (apologies if i have spelt that wrong!), best driver ever! stay here and get involved!"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best thing about this hostel for me was the social atmosphere, as i came to la for the first time as a solo traveller for only a few nights. something was going on almost every night, so i got the chance to meet lots of other people. in particular the wine tasting evening and free taco/karaoke night was surprisingly fun (beforehand i could only picture it being somewhat cringe-worthy), helped along by free drinks! i found the staff to be friendly and helpful, and a good laugh to boot!"
Finland,Female,25-30,5.4,4,8,8,4,6,6,2,"this hostel is full of mold. me and my friend got really sick (really sore throats, hard to breathe) after the first night and were sick the whole time (5 days). the symptoms were familiar and we got better soon after we left the hostel. also our room mates got sick and they didn't have the flu either.  the free breakfast was allright: toast, jam, peanut butter, nutella, fruits, oatmeel, tea, coffee, juice. the parties were ok and it's also a good thing that there's food every night (not free)."
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"great hostel. rooms have own bathroom and kitchen which is so useful. shower was good. wifi didnt reach our room on second floor very well and was slow at peak times but good in common areas. breakfast was great, as were free tacos for dinner. lively and loud hostel great location for hollywood and easy access to bus services/station."
Argentina,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,super mellow helpful staff. amazing common areas and great activities offered
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"i only stayed here one night coming straight from the airport (intercontinental flight) so i mainly used it for sleeping. but the rooms were awesome with ensuite bathroom and kitchen, never seen that before in a hostel. the bed was squeeky but comfortable. they seemed to offer a lot of activities but i didn't look into them very well. would come back here"
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel. one of the best ive stayed in!   lively atmosphere, free food, kitchens in the rooms, what more can you want?!     wouldn't do some of their tours / shuttles, can get to all of the places offered cheaper on public transport (just may take a little longer)"
France,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"first time in hollywood, i already went in west hollywood and i loved it. i love it in hollywood too, clean, nice staff, if i'm going in la again, i will go there! fiew blocks from hollywood boulevard where the names of famous people are. really good breakfast, i mean for me the toast and tea and coffe were enough, but you have cereal and milk too."
Argentina,Female,31-40,7.4,10,6,10,6,8,6,6,"it was not a bad hostel. it is closer to the walk of fame and the chinese theatre.  however, music was loud and all the rooms windows go to the patio, where all people are listening to music or talking until long hours, so it may be hard to sleep with the noise. the parking is free but you need to leave the keys with them. breakfast was decent."
France,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"very nice hostel if you want to party and have fun, a bit loud if you want to have a good rest during the night. lots of activities organized like parties, dinners, etc. good location to visit hollywood boulevard, runyon canyon park and griffith park. neighborhood quiet during the day and, let's say ""lively"" during the night, but still safe. very nice and helpful staff with a lot of facilities (like printers, towels, breakfast, etc). no big lockers available though !"
Switzerland,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"one of the best hostels i stayed so far regarding to facilities, location and value for money. the hotel is a 5 min walk away from the metro and the hollywood walk of fame. prices are low for the us and the dorm i was in has its own bathroom (roomy and clean) and its own kitchen! the hostel proposes many activities every day, however not a lot of people sign in. the inner court is nice even though music is a bit loud in the evening."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,6,10,6,10,6,8,10,"not the best location.. yes it's on hollywood boulevard but its a good 25/30 minutes walk to get to the main section.. but otherwise, i liked this place. the rooms were nice and homy, with a kitchen and a good bathroom. some staff friendly, some not so much. good vibes though, party atmosphere but not obnoxious, and very secure. breakfast very basic."
Spain,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"very nice hostel: clean, nice staff, and tasty breakfast. good value for money in the area of hollywood. it's in the opposite part of the walk of fame, far from the crowded areas of hollywood boulevard, which made me feel slightly insecure at night. but, in general it was good.    ah, another thing is that there are parties held in the outdoor common areas in the hostel, so it's a bit noisy at night. i used earplugs!"
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10,10,4,8,10,10,8,"awesome place to stay! staff were very helpful, rooms were awesome i was expecting alot worse! the location is close to hollywood but hollywood isnt what its cracked upto be but thats not their fault!"

NewZealand,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything you could ask for in a hostel! all the staff were really friendly and tried to get everyone involved with hostel activities. room was really clean and shower was amazing!
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,came to la for business. this was great location close to train. beds were comfortable. nice bathroom with hot shower.  comp breakfast was added bonus. $5.00 sunday dinner was great.
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,hostel was conveniently located about 4 blocks from train. great value for the money. was able to get everywhere by public transportation. fair breakfeast and $5.00 sunday night dinner was great!  would have preferred for them to have quiet in courtyard with no music after 10pm. beds were comfortable and good bathroom facilities.

USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"only stayed for one night, but it was friday and i joined for the night out in hollywood. had a blast and would definitely recommend as a party hostel."

England,Female,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"2nd time at this hostel, 1st time was ok but things seemed to have improved this time as hostel seemed cleaner &amp; more organised. great location on hollywood boulevard, good free breakfast, &amp; a comfy clean bed. happy with everything &amp; will return next time in la. thanks"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"loved this hostel! helpful staff booked day tours, transfers etc. great breakfast. organised night activities were great for socialising! free alcohol and karaoke is always a win. would recommend"

Mexico,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"the staff here is amazing! people are so chill here, i was able to make so many new friends that sadly i have to say bye to,  i would definetly recommend this hostel to anyone who is traveling to la"
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,8,6,8,8,"location was great, right near everything. events were decent. the reception staff apon arrival and departure were just plain rude. tip the bloke at the convenient store across the rd. hes a legend. he deals with all type of riff raff and still puts on a happy face."

Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel to stay and party! they organise events all week long and have great deals on dinner, drinks and entry into clubs. the pre drinking here was better than actually going out. rooms have own bathrooms &amp; kitchens too. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"fun hostel located in hollywood! would not recommend to anyone looking for peace and quiet, definitely high energy and party orientated. they have awesome events on most days and nights, perfect for anyone not wishing to stay in downtown la and who doesn't mind parties in the inner driveway/courtyard until late most nights."
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,it was a great stay and if you don't know anyone just participate of any activity they are cheap and you will meet lots of cool people.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,really good rooms. i had a kitchen and bathroom in my six bed mixed dorm. everyone is really friendly. i got there early and was able to leave my bag there until my room was available.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"this is one of the most fun hostels i've stayed in - always a great, social vibe with events on every night and plenty of free/chesp drinks and food. the rooms were small but comfortable and it was good to have your own bathroom and kitchenette in each dorm."
Brazil,Female,31-40,7.7,8,10,10,8,6,10,2,"the hostel has great location, communicative staff and very helpful. all the staff are solicitous to serve you and make your ride the best. the perfect price. they give towel and clean and smelling bedding.  but the accommodation ...  it happened that in my room, there were many cheap (insects) i killed 3:01 friend killed another. it made me sick. i did not warn anyone, for she was leaving.  kind regards."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,10,8,8,8,6,8,6,"location is good but i felt a bit unsafe walking back to the hostel by myself in the dark. the rooms are okay, the fact they include their own bathroom and kitchen is a bonus. they're not the cleanest but its bearable. beds were decent, but make sure you ask for a blanket when you check in as they only give you sheets by default. there are lots of hostel activities that are often really cheap which was great. i went to disneyland on a tour organised for me by the hostel and it was fantastic."
Iraq,Male,25-30,6.9,8,8,10,6,2,8,6,i booked for 6 beds and when i checked in they put me in 8 beds when i asked them why they say it is the same prices and we want to keep you with your friend. it was ridiculuos because tge prices are different and when i booked there are rooms for 2 persons on the 6 beds. the hostel is noisey till late night tgere are parties and people do lots if noisey things. 
Denmark,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,good place to meet people. many things going on. i was there for new years - they had done a lot to make a nice party. arrived there at 1 am and was so tired i didn't see the receptionist decided to keep my driver's licence. i discovered it in a drawer by chance when i two days later asked another receptionist for directions. the receptionist also only gave me a thin sheet for my bed and i was so cold the first night - the next day i found out they have blankets. out heater broke three times.
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,5.4,4,10,8,2,4,4,6,"location is good but some manager was, i think, have a racist mind other manager was so kind but one manager was like racist and wifi is so bad, and heater always have a problem, and so many insect in the room"
Brazil,Male,18-24,5.1,6,4,10,8,4,2,2,"very disorganized. they don't know how many people are in each room, so we had to look for beds in some rooms.  go there only if you want something very crazy and don't care about organization and cleanliness."
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,it was just a few days but it was amazing! i recommended for everybody!
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,"couldn't ask for a better location in hollywood and very easy to get to downtown la. probably the best party hostel i've stayed at in the last three months so it's very easy to meet people, plus they do free food and drinks some nights "
Australia,Couple,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,well. the staff were great   so too the security and they acted on  disturbing behaviour by tossing people out of the hostel.   unfortunately they had some jerks staying there who went way to far   .ie slotting blue movies on dvds that all the women could see....not the fault of the staff as they weren't aware.   some. bloke and a sheila decided to get it on in our dorm room kitchen which i thought was pretty average but the staff acted on that.   they try very hard to control people's actions
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very useful computer rooms, nice staff, the hostel provides lots of activities to do like beer nights, however, i would avoid staying in the hollywood area in general because it is disgusting, boring, and lame. not like the movies, but a great hostel!!! would recommend."
Germany,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the beste hostels i have been staying in so far.
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,6,10,10,"in a great location - 10minute walk to the main part of hollywood blvd, trains and buses.  great atmosphere with plenty of common areas to chill or to socialize. bear in mind that if you're a light sleeper you may want earplugs to sleep with as the music can go late. nice free breakfast and plenty of daily activities offered. some staff were really friendly and helpful and some weren't.  the dorm had both a bathroom and a kitchen which was handy! i would recommend this place to a friend. "
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"banana staff was amazing, especially mark, very friendly, fun and welcoming."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,10,6,"the banana bungalow hostel is the best hostel i've ever been to so far. the staff is very nice and willing to help you with everything. the atmosphere is fantastic and there are always some free or low-cost activities you could join in. the dorms are simple and unfortunately not that clean, but i would consider it as average for a hostel."
Italy,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay, friendly staff , close to everything.  do not take the night bus to pubs, was a waste of money for nothing"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"this place was fantastic. everything i could want as a seasoned round the world traveller. cheap washing with free powder. good breakfast, free dinner and drinks on wednesday! seriously amazing. and the karaoke wasn't half bad as well :) clean big room with internal kitchen, although i didn't have to use it as i got so much included food from the hostel. great social areas and activities and good information on what is happening around hollywood. have already sent people this way."
Sweden,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,breakfast could have been improved!
England,Couple,18-24,6.6,6,8,6,6,8,8,4,"our room felt like it needed a good clean. i don't think it was cleaned once in the whole 6 nights we stayed, so the carpet was filthy and there was rubbish all around the room. the bathroom floor kept flooding and there were just towels thrown down to clear up the mess so it was constantly damp. the only mirror in the whole 8 bed dorm was in the bathroom which meant it was constantly busy, would be nice to have a few facilities in the rooms. lots of night time activities to choose from though."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,i enojoyed my stay very much. i had a great time at la. hostel is well located. if you don't mind walking in 15min you're at the chinese theatre. it's a good choice if you don't mind the party atmosphere.
Singapore,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,rooms are clean and i like the kitchen attached to rooms
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,10,6,"great hostel, good value, good vibes"
Turkey,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"location was perfect and having a garage helped us a lot. at night room became chilly, that would have been better if they had turned on heater."
England,Female,25-30,8.3,10,10,8,8,8,8,6,"a very cool, laid-back atmosphere which is always full of friendly people- putting any solo traveller at ease.   the staff are very helpful and the organised trips on offer are great as there is always something to do.   the rooms are quite dirty, but iv seen worse.  the only thing i would recommend, is opening the tiki garden and bar every night, as there are the only places to socialise with other guests, however i went in winter, so maybe there's more stuff going on at night in the summer?"
SaudiArabia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the hostel staff are very friendly, close to downtown and shops area. it really worth what i paid for !! "
Finland,MixedGroup,18-24,6.9,6,10,6,8,4,8,6,"the hostel was generally okay, except for the staff that was quite unhelpful and rude. they didn't inform or help with any other business than hostel activities. but the long-haired breakfast guy was great! other than that, the rooms were nice and well equipped. also the beverages we're very low-prized! "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,second visit. excellent. please read my review.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,definately worth a stay at this place :) 
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"this hostel is in a good location - close to the red line, great hike to the observatory and on hollywood bvd. the rooms were okay, but had very small lockers. there are lots of activities, so if you're traveling alone this is a great place to meet people. the staff are friendly and helpful as well."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,super happy i chose this place! everyone from the staff to other guests were fun and always helpful. loved the kitchen and tv being all in your room. will definitely be back next time i'm in la.
SouthAfrica,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.1,4,10,8,2,2,8,2,staff are very rude! dorms are dirty and it was a very unpleasant stay !! 
Australia,Female,25-30,2.3,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,"i booked and paid for my night here in advance and when i turned up for check in, they had no record of my booking (even though i was physically in the office the evening before to book), so they had taken my money but had no room for me. furthermore, i found them to be incredibly unhelpful and unapologetic for their mistake, and no one bothered to follow up with me even after promising and me trying to follow up. will never ever book banana bungalow again"
Afghanistan,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,awesome hostel !!!  i just loved this hostel - probably one of the best hotels i have been at. 
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,"everything is run down a bit, works and is clean but not as awesome as other hostels. we had an old guy who snored loud and burned stuff in the kitchen at six every day, pretty sure he was living there. car parking is nice, but you have to leave your keys at the desk and they will give them out to whoever (various staff i hadn't seen let me go back and pick my keys out). my car is bad so i didn't care. bring your own blankets, they just give you sheets."
Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,need soap and paper towels in rooms but otherwise all very good
Scotland,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,amazing. everybody was very hospitable and helpful and the vibe of the place was awesome. it was literally a party every night and everybody was socialising and hanging out until all hours of the morning. would definitely come here again. definitely recommended!
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,i had a great time at the banana bungalow. plenty of fun activities including an open bar karaoke night and free tacos! found cockroaches in my room though but still worth the stay.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,6,6,location and price was good. however this is not a good place to stay if you plan on sleeping. for 3 nights i had to sleep with earplugs due to people partying out in the courtyard. thought the bathroom was absolutely disgusting- definitially not cleaned very often. not to mention the blocked sink and blocked shower
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel. staff are friendly and are informative. location is great - on hollywood blvd but down the end..didn't feel so safe going back by myself at night, but that's more me than the hostel itself. the tipsy tour and shuttles to theme parks are worth every penny and i will defiantly stay there again "
England,Female,31-40,6.9,8,8,6,6,8,4,8,well located for access to key tourist attractions but a somewhat rundown area of town. lacking common space for guests who want to relax instead of party. very noisy at night.
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,walking distance from all the hollywood blvd excitement. great value for the money. would stay again!
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,6,6,8,10,10,8,"i had a good 3 nights at banana bungalow. bed was reasonably comfy, however i spent the first couple of nights freezing as only sheets were provided. i loved that the room had it's own kitchen/dining area and ensuite, however the lockers in the room were tiny and power points accessible from the top bunks would have been nice. the staff at meals and evening events were incredible plus there was a great social environment. "
Norway,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"an activity every night. one of the best hostel i stayed at. a place to meet people, chill out or party."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i rarely right reviews but i loved banana bungalow hollywood. the staff was so friendly, they even knew me by name and constantly were making recommendations. the place has free parking wifi and breakfast, its in the heart of hollywood, they constantly have stuff going on, the travelers that stay there are chill, it's pretty secure, and very clean. if you're looking for something long term you can even stay there for free if you work 20 hours a week. honestly, i enjoyed staying in too much!"
NorthernIreland,MixedGroup,25-30,4.6,4,4,8,2,6,6,2,"we had booked to stay here 6 nights, we stayed 2. on the 2nd day we established that even with a padlock on them you can still open the lockers. that night my boyfriend got bitten all over by bed bugs!! the next day we told the staff member available we were leaving. we told him why. we had to return twice to get a refund. and their solution to the locker issue was us a bigger lock."
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very good hostel. the breakfast and the wi-fi network could be better.
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"love it here, people are super nice and friendly.  a lot of free stuffs gave away.  not too expensive and get more than toucan ask for.  two thums up."
Austria,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,a great place to stay.  highly recmended.  staff is incredibly helpful and friendly.  location is good.  
HongKong,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was a fun stay!
NewZealand,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"well situated blocks from hollywood action, banana bungalow is excellent value for dollar at a prime location in los angeles. the bed was comfortable, the kitchen was a nice touch, and the place has a pleasantly laid back atmosphere."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"very good hostel with lots of events planned, for every day of the week. not in the best of locations if you do not have a car though. it is possible to get everywhere in la on public transport, it just takes ages."
England,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,7.1,6,6,10,8,8,8,4,"we enjoyed our stay here. the location is great if you want to be near hollywood. free breakfast which is toast &amp; cereal. coffee tank needs to be disposed of though as is old &amp; disgusting! overall place could do with a clean up, we had ants in the room too as they have a kitchen in each room, which i think is a bad idea as people just leave food out &amp; rooms are not cleaned very well regulary. but it is still an ok place to stay &amp; we enjoyed the atmosphere."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,8,8,"awesome place to stay with lots of activities organised by the staff, who were all super friendly and helpful! only drama is the poor/non existent air conditioners. other than that a great place to stay in la."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,coolest place in la
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great social atmosphere loved staying here
Wales,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good hostel, location is great and awesome party atmosphere! also steyed in the weho one."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,8,8,"hollywood is a dump but this is still a reasonably central location to be in. pretty much as good as a hostel gets: tvs and kitchen in every room, events every day, shuttles to the beach, friendly staff etc. they should probably treat their driver better though, sounds like he has to work really long hours"
England,MixedGroup,18-24,4,2,2,8,6,2,6,2,"do not stay if single traveller! had a staff member ask me and several friends if we ""wanted some black d**k in us"" at night, repulsive.. also one of the staff allowed underage drinking and drug taking.. saw several fights happen here many people who didn't stay at the hostel lurk around late at night.. did not feel safe here at all and the rooms where filthy.. much better options in hollywood avoid at all costs "
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,nice place to stay in l.a. ;-)
Austria,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,10,6,"the hostel is nice, they try to keep you busy with activities day and evening. the facilities are mostly clean, but on my last day i saw a few cockroaches in the kitchen and ants in the bathroom."
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,"so much fun. i made so many friends at this hostel and i really think its down to the amazing staff going out of their way to get everyone involved, i have stayed in hostels since and the atmosphere just has not been the same. the tipsy tour is a great idea and a good way of getting people involved. ara and the thai or philipino guy that did breakfast some days were very informative of all the events going on its nice that the staff remember everyones names. free tacos was a good idea."
France,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,"the stay was ok but there were a few small cockroaches in the kitchen. i believe this is due to the people we were staying with as there were dirty dishes in the sink. there was also a lot of noise from the occupants of the other rooms who were coming back from nightclubs. fortunately we were so exhausted that we were not too bothered by the noise. finally, the personnel did not help much to rent a car or to pay anything locally with local credit cards."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.6,6,8,10,6,6,8,2,"our room was super dirty and gross, we had an infestation of ants, all over the cutlery and inside the drawers in the kitchen.  the staff came to try and sort it out but there were still small ants crawling everywhere, so needless to say we didn't cook in the kitchen as they were fully booked and unable to move us to another room.  the staff weren't super helpful but they were ok.  there was very loud music playing late at night right next to all the rooms, ( till between 11 and midnight)."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we're very very satisfied.
Sweden,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,6,6,6,2,"the location was good and the staff was okay. but, in our room there were ants crawling around (probably because of the kitchen and the poor cleaning from the hostel/guests), the shower was always dripping, poor breakfast (just some white bread and cereal) and awful parking space. we booked the hostel for its free parking, but one night it was full and we had to find a parkingspot without help from the staff and then pay and park a few blocks from the hostel. we won't stay here next time in la."
CzechRepublic,MixedGroup,18-24,6,4,6,10,6,8,6,2,"unfortunately, we had to stay there two times. first time we got a dirtiest room ever with not enough free beds, so i had to sleep with my husband in the same bed although we paid for two beds :( we also got a 8 bed instead of a 6 bed room. and the people there were weird. the second time it was much better, only there were bugs in bathroom and in the kitchen :( did not like it."
Japan,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,8,10,10,very nice hostel! i enjoyed very much.
England,Female,25-30,7.4,8,10,8,8,8,8,2,the stay was going great until the third day when we found a cockroach in the room. there were also ants all over the beds. maybe if the hostel didn't have kitchens in the rooms this wouldn't be a problem.     the staff were friendly about it but seemed nonchalant. they refunded us for the next night which we were due to stay and we left a day early.
Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,10,8,"stayed there for the 2nd time and it's been great! the location is perfect and the staff is really cool! always had much fun during taco and karaoke night!!! they offer day trips and lots of fun times, they're really helpful and if i ever go back to la, i'll definitely stay ther again. they also offer breakfast and a parking space... the location on hollywood blvd is perfect! thanks!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,6,10,8,8,8,"great hostel for the price, some good options for day trips. great $5 dinners and great facilities. second time staying here. would totally recommend."
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best time every, will be back"
Germany,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel!!!! first the atmosphere is so nice - over all at night. the hostel has a big yard with palm trees and at night there are loads of blue lights hanging from the trees which looks so nice. also you can see the hollywood sign from the hostel. the staff is very friendly and helpful (ask them for shuttles to sightseeing attractions)! they clean the bathroom in the dorms every day, which was very nice as we stayed in a 8 bed dorm, although we booked a 6 bed dorm, but was no problem"
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,10,6,"really good place to meet people if you're travelling on your own with lots of organised tours. cleanliness wasn't great though, there were ants in the bathroom."
England,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,8,6,8,6,"room was quite dirty, crisps all over the floor and mattress. young crowd, noisy"
Ireland,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,great hostel with a lot going on! particularly likes the yard area where guests could get to know one another! good hostel for party animals as there are plenty of events! sometimes it was a little uncomfortable to sleep at night due to the heat and the shower head leaked but otherwise would recommend this place! 
Scotland,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,10,2,8,8,hostel location and facilities are great. the staff were not helpful and rude at times. not the best.
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,8,8,6,lovely stay at banana bungalow. great location! would recommend :)
Germany,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice stay and staff, good location for hollywood"
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,it was a great hostel. they had stuff plan every night.  it was only like a 10 to 15 min walk to see everything. but the real reason to stay here if you want to meet people from all over the world and you want to party this is the place.
Germany,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location with happy young crowd in courtyard, enjoying table tennis, basketball and freedom to hang out. tiki garden on back, where the breakfast is served, is a nice quiet place to chill or use your tablet, as it has lots of electrical outlets. breakfast is simple, but given the comparably cheap rates, a bonus. dorms w own fridge and kitchen, only drawback is that mine had beds divided between entrance area and other bedroom, so people going to the later disturb others passing through."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay, great parties, super close to everything in hollywood."
Scotland,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"really good hostel, great location for pubs and clubs. the staff were good and helpful and different themed nights every night good to get to know people"
BritishVirginIslands,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've stayed in. great atmosphere, lots of friendly people, really clean and spacious rooms, activities organised every night and jp was awesome. made la a better experience. thanks a lot! "
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,8,great hostel good atmosphere easy to chill and party as well! would stay again
Canada,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"stayed 6 nights. front desk staff exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful! other staff friendly and efficient. comfortable, easy stay. i would stay there again."
England,Male,25-30,6.6,6,10,4,8,6,6,6,"overall the hostel was ok, there was a small issue when we first arrived and our party had been split into different areas. after complaining this was quickly rectified and we were also given complementary dinner, free drinks and entry to one of the top hollywood nightclubs! no complaints there...the hostel itself is actually pretty cool. its laid out in the style of a classic american ""motel"" the only thing that sucks is the location, its a loooong walk to the main hollywood attractions."
England,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,10,6,"great facilities and worth the money, staff are helpfull and the travelers that stay there are fun and friendly, deffinately worth the stay!"
Sweden,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,10,8,we stayed for two nights in a dorm and were really satisfied with our stay. there was a lot of young people socializing at the evenings wich was great. the hostel also has a free parking lot for those with a car. it is first come first serve but we got a space all the time!
China,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"nice stay in hollywood. around 10 min walk from metro station, 1 min walk from bus station. great for me to explore my dreamland. but one tip for other travelers: do not stay in room 104. wifi sucks; noisy (radio from 8am to 11pm); people talking by your window at any time even at late night cause the room is by the common area."
Australia,Male,31-40,6.6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,pretty good for a few nights stay. lots of drinking games and fun for the family
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"an awesome, clean, friendly and sociable hostel."
England,Female,25-30,6.9,8,6,8,8,6,6,6,"ok place to stay considering there aren't many better options in los angeles. spacious dorms and helpful staff. la city tour was not worth the money, don't bother."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"would definitely recommend this hostel, will most likely be staying there again in the future."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,6,8,8,10,8,a hostel with a good atmosphere. in hollywood so good if u like the walk of fame and chinese theater. la is a large city with bad public transport so not a great location if that is not your thing.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,fun hostel with good activities each night. make sure you get involved and enjoy. bit of a walk from hollywood/vine but needed to walk off the alcohol/food every night. had such a good time with everyone there.
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,10,6,the atmosphere and location was really great. the rooms were a little cramped. we also experienced a problem with room placement; however the staff was very apologetic and accommodating.
Finland,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"first time traveling alone and i couldn't have chosen a better hostel to stay at. lots of cool people from all around the world, friendly staff and nice dorms, combined with the perfect location right in hollywood and lots of activities: the perfect vacation for a budget traveler. even if money is not an issue, i can recommend the hostel for making friends and having a great time!"
Norway,Male,31-40,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"stayed here more than to times.  room with kitchen in dorm room, only share with six people witch is great if your planning on making food.  one oven/stowe didn't work in one room, one bathroom didn't have a working shower, i guess that's maybe too expensive to fix the bathrooms.  young crowd with party instinct, an activity every evening/night like free taco dinner and free beers with karaoke later.  one of most rememberable stay i had over the hostels in la"
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very clean and nice. super friendly and helpful staff. breakfast was a bit scarce but as soon as pb looked empty, the staff replaced it immediately."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,definitely a party hostel. so if u want a quiet stay in hollywood i wouldn't go here. good party atmosphere here.
Luxembourg,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,3.1,2,2,4,2,2,8,2,"atmosphere good because the other visitor were fun. however, the staff is not qualified to solve any problems. not only did one of our smartphones get stolen, moreover the staff didn't show any concern and wouldn't even help us to get it back. the person taking care of the reception at that time asked us what we could do to solve the problem, my friend had to explain to him how to do his job and how to find out phone numbers of other residents. the tours are overpriced, they take advantage."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,this place was in a great location and the staff were really helpful. lots of info on buses and how to get to places which was great! the bunks were incredibly squeaky and some of the pillows were little more than a ball of fluff but the mattresses were comfy. the shower in our room was a little cold and the wifi was patchy and weak at best - but overall the place had a great atmosphere and lots of activities and dinners if you wanted to participate. definitely good value!
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,awesome place with very friendly staff and organised hostel activities every day. really nice place to stay.
Australia,Male,18-24,6,8,2,8,8,4,8,4,"cheap, but otherwise very mixed feelings.  decent and clean bathroom, absolutely filthy bedrooms.  rusted lockers and very old rooms, including power sockets with cable coming out of the walls. however the private kitchen and fridge is useful.  somewhat of a shifty neighbourhood but the price is good. "
Scotland,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed my stay here, very easy to meet other travelers and the staff were very friendly and helpful. the only thing i would maybe recommend is that you stay in the west hollywood hostel which is nearer the beaches and the actual walk of fame is a bit cheesy."
Philippines,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"i loved that they serve free nutella for breakfast, i have never found a hostel that does that and i was also really impressed with the quality of people working in this hostel.  elena (i think she is italian) is super helpful  i suggest you reach out to her if you need anything.   i think i made a new friend!  i'm definitely coming back and recommend this place!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,6,8,4,6,6,6,8,"our stay was okay, the location wasn't the best, it's close to the walk of fame and about 15 min walk to the chinese theatre etc, but to get to santa monica on public transport it took about 90 mins. the wifi only worked outside of the rooms and was pretty slow. you're only given a sheet, no quilt, so we were freezing a few of the nights. we got told off when we were airing our room out by having the door open during the day, but at 3am people were allowed to play basketball and shout."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.9,4,8,8,8,6,6,8,"would not stay here again as i was overcharged by $5.24 (apparently they don't charge cents and just round - that was $0.24 cents of it - a rip off). they have a $5 card fee. she said that it was on this website and their website, i said that i didn't see it on either website. i would not stay here again, as i'm not happy about their rounding policy and not being advised until that i got to check in, that they have a $5 fee for paying on card !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"this place is absolutely amazing for a backpacker, i met some great people and partied until 4.30am. the staff were really friendly as well and made sure that everyone got involved"
China,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,"location is perfect, atmosphere is great, but some staff just don't have clear picture of their job and wifi there is absolutely horrible."
Scotland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved my stay there perfect location great people n cheap for what was included 
China,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,"location is perfect, atmosphere is great, but some staff just don't have clear picture of their job and wifi there is absolutely horrible."
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"both the regular staff and the travelling staff made this one of my favourite hostels of all time, and i've stayed at quite a few.  guiseppe and sam especially were diamond geezers with their approach to guest relations, massive thanks to all at bb.  ps. the tiki gardens are looking fab."
NewZealand,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,top hostel. amazing social activities and stellar staff!!
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,love everything about this place. a cool place for party poppers ! 
Colombia,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"clean rooms, separate bathroom and kitchen, friendly environment. really liked it. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,"thanks banana bungalow for an amazing start to our us adventures! fantastic, friendly hostel with plenty of people around to hang out with and party. giuseppe is a fantastic addition to the staff, always ensuring we were participating in the nightly events! wifi was a bit hit and miss for us. white rabbit &amp; cheeky x"
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,"the hostel has a great cost effective, but needs to improve its security. my towel disappeared from my room and no one was keen to help me look. luckily it was an object of low value, but i wonder that the same policy should apply to objects of great financial value."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,"only bad thing was there was limited kitchen utensils, had to borrow from staff. so the kitchen was pretty useless"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,6,10,10,"the hostel is nice with plenty of activities, friendly atmosphere and nicely layed out. staff can sometimes be useless when asking for help - got given, you just google it and it'll tell you when asking them a few questions. there was an instance when people not actually staying in the hostel were just loitering around and there was one day where someone off the street pretended they were staying in the hostel and tried to access a room. they do have parking inside the hostel which is a bonus."
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"whether you'll enjoy your stay depends on what you're looking for.  this is very much a party hostel and since my room happened to be above their after hours party room, it was very hard to get much sleep.  to be fair when i brought this up at 4am the staff did have them turn the music down.  the dinner and club event was fun and the location is great if you want to see hollywood."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,"really good. the dorms had both an ensuite and small kitchen. free breakfast and internet. daily housekeeping, so it's always clean. good location right on hollywood blvd. laundry is very cheap, and hostel activities most days. only complaint would be the hostel activities are pretty unorganised, especially the trip to the other hostel. you're much better off going out for the night doing your own thing."
Sweden,Female,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,10,10,6,"this is probably the best hostel i have stayed at. my stay was really good, stayed for 6 days and there was something going on every day/night. and it was either free or really cheap. the room may not have been the cleanest and the shower was really slow but we had a kitchen and it was good. i stayed in a 6 mix dorm. it was really close to the main part of hollywood boulevard. the staff was really great, friendly and fun trying to engage you in their activities.     5/5 toasts for sure"
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,8,8,8,4,the set up of the hostel was good i especially liked the tiki bar where you eat breakfast. our room setup was good except that it smelt terribly for the 3 nights that we were there. wifi was good everywhere except the bedroom. the guys that were organising parties and drinkin etc. were very good at trying to get you involved and meeting new people. location is good if you want to spent time in hollywood and is a short walk to los angeles metro train. overall good stay!
England,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,we'd booked 2 beds in a 8 bed dorm. when we go into the dorm it was so messy we weren't even sure which beds were free or taken. we went back to reception and they upgraded us to a private double so we were very pleased. stayed 3 nights in total. breakfast is included which is great. they always have something going on in the evenings which you can join in on. one night they did free beer and tacos :) the location is good but we spent most of our time seeing the surrounding areas of l.a
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've stayed in a lot of hostels, and this is by far the best one ever!!!!! from the staff to the location, this hostel more than deserves the perfect score i gave it. i would definitely stay here again, and i highly recommend banana bungalow to anyone staying in la. "
USA,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"besides the crazy girl who kept talking to herself and waking everyone up, it was a nice and clean hostel."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,4.6,2,8,6,2,6,6,2,security and location is pretty so so. it takes about 5~10 minutes from hollywood vine station to the hostel.  staff.. it depends on the staffs.  atmosphere is pretty good. there were many people hanging out each other on the yard everyday.  cleanliness is poor. it seems they arrange just blankets. nothing is cleaned.  and what i was really disappointed is they required 5$ for paying with card. it didn't mention before. it sucks. there is no hostel like this. the bed was too noisy.
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"great place and value for money. rooms are ok and hostel structure is good! great breakfast and location is nice close to metro. the ""hawaian/indonesian guy"" loves to sell tours! you have to eat on the thai restaurant just beside the palms!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8,10,6,6,8,10,8,8,"hostel was overall a good place to stay, had a lot of room and the staff really made an effort to include everyone in group activities to get everyone to mingle. they also made it very affodable for backpackers on a tight budget."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel is really good. i stayed in a bedroom for six people. the bedroom was cleaned every day and there was a kitchen and a bathroom in it. the only thing bad is the wifi, the intermt is slow and sometimes it was possible to use it only outside de bedroom."
England,Male,18-24,6,8,6,6,8,6,6,2,cockroach in the fridge as well as a pot full of mold. please check up on the fridges when cleaning.
Uruguay,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,really nice!
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,6,10,"the rooms/facilities here are great! they have nice bathrooms and kitchens which is very handy,and the internet is good with a lot of free computers available for use. overall i thought it was a nice place and i'd stay again."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,8,10,10,8,very helpful staff ... even tell u what's good to do in the city :)  happily stay here again !! chilled vibe ... 
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay here, they have heaps of stuff going on - karaoke, dinners, nights out etc so it's really easy to meet people. the staff were awesome and the cheap dinners were pretty good. was also nice to have a bathroom and kitchen in the room (not that i used that much!). good location right near the walk of fame. great hostel if you want to party :-)"
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,10,6,6,8,"it is just 2 blocks from the walk of fame, and it is just on the hollywood boulevard! the price is good and excellent location"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"a great party hostel, you meet people, they have always something going on, you get free beer, coffee, breakfast (which was not just bread but also cereals, fruits, ...)  and on some days every week, they even have a free tacodinner. also the staff is really funny and friendly and the terace looks great and is nice to relaxe. it's really close to everything in hollywood."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,10,8,a great place to meet nice ppl!
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"i thought this was a very nice hostel. the staff was really nice :) they made this a wonderful experience. the hostel is located on hollywood boulevard, but a bit on the outside. the hostel provides wonderful information and print out tickets for free. they recommended me a nice hostel in sf as well, which turned out the be great."
Turkey,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,"i was a solo female traveler, so i needed a really convenient place to stay and i am really glad i picked this hostel. it has a 4-5 minutes of walking distance from hollywood/vine metro station and my return at late night was not a problem.    they offer free breakfast, free wifi, computers and 2 pages of free printing. lockers are available in rooms but you need to have your own lock.    there is also a very good and unexpectedly cheap thai restaurant next to the place."
France,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,8,6,6,the hostel was nice.
Australia,Couple,41+,7.4,8,6,10,8,8,6,6,we enjoyed a bit noisy in courtyard late at night  breakfast excellent got my airport shuttle refunded  staff very helpful   was close to metro and hollywood strip a walked down  if you enjoy walking  a good walk to  hollywood hills and planetarium. value for money
Argentina,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"very clean, the.stuff nice and helpful,  excellent breakfast"

Antarctica,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,8,8,very nice hostel with great people
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,10,6,8,10,8,6,the staff were friendly and always helpful. the location wasn't great- our bed was right next to a main road but it's good if you want to be close to hollywood strip.
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,"had a wonderful time, especially as a solo traveller. the pool table and table tennis table made for some great entertainment and friend making! i would advise that lone females like myself don't venture out to far at night, as the area is a little sketchy."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"it was really great to have stayed at banana bungalow hollywood! great location: close to walk of fame, hollywood sign, metro station, a lot of restaurants, liquor store, supermarket, etc. la is a very spaced out city, so it is impossible to be really close to everything, but this hostel offers sightseeing for a not so cheap price and party bus to clubs. it is a very party atmosphere. i made great friends and i went alone. i recommend this hostel."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great help from the reception girls, bathrooms were always cleaned well by the cleaning crew.    there is always something happening at the hostel every night plus they are great value for everything!"
Lebanon,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,it was one of the best experiences ever. i'm definitely coming back.
Ireland,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is ideal; the location, the atmosphere and the events created by the tireless staff made it a very relaxed and enjoyable stay."
England,Male,41+,6.6,6,6,6,10,4,8,6,"i thought i could have been treated with more respect.  in a private room the first night, i was subjected to the ills of bed bug bites and cockroaches.  $6 was knocked off my bill for the inconvenience.  six dollars!  i stayed 3 more nights in a dorm situation and contended with drunk and disorderly (and messy!) australians and other strange travelers.    i was so unhappy there i flew back to toronto where people are a lot nicer."
Wales,Male,25-30,6.9,8,4,10,8,4,6,8,"worst hostel i've ever stayed at, but also the cheapest.  would be better if they spent their money on new beds and better locks than lcd tvs and kitting out party buses.  the first staff member i met was a rude and uncompromising front desk lady, second was a tour bus driver who i thought was great until i learned he was essentially a drug dealer (and insinuated that i would be taking the blame for the coke if we were stopped.).  beds are truly awful.  only stay here if all you want is a party."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,always a pleasure. best hostel in la!!!!!
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,so much fun! nothing more to say other than you will have so much fun!!! and the staff are phenomenal!!!
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice hostel, good location and friendly staff. breakfast its outside and can get a bit chilly still its a nice breakfast. it gets a bit loud at night. u might want to reconsider if u need to rest but you ll like it if u want to party."
Poland,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,"staff really helpful and nice, location for that small money is excellent! and atmosphere is really friendly. you can meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world."
Singapore,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,8,6,6,"to be fair , staff are relatively helpful to help me in directions by printing out navigations etc. the hostel promised to received my parcels but one of them were refused &amp; sent back, i left without my parcel, tours were great, place v retro, old style hollywood, but relatively clean, beds creaking though, location is 10mins frm train station, no activity nearby during night, wifi signal v weak in room, but room is like a studio with a fully equiped kitchen, good for short stay in los angeles"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,staff were a great help in great location. only problem were language barriers between the people in the room we shared with. jim on reception was brilliant and beyond helpful.
Vietnam,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"this is a fun and active hostel.  everytime i go to la, this is the hostel i would stay.  it's fun, active, awesome staffs, great location, and cost.  location is just 15 mins walk to main hollywood attractions.  they have daily activities at the hostels, where you can easily meet other travelers from all over the world.  one of my fav is the ping pong table :)"
England,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,6,10,8,10,8,"i met lots of nice people here. both in my room, at breakfast in the garden and at the karaoke night. the hollywood nightclub trip on the other hand was ""meh"".  can be a bit noisy in the courtyard at night but most nights seemed to be ok.  a guy there sold us some basketball tickets which a good experience.  bit of a walk to the stars but not too bad.  i recommend jogging up runyon canyon hills!  there are a few crazy people in hollywood talking to themselves in the street."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,defiantly would stay at banana bungalow again! thought it was great that staff went out of there way for evening social events. also thanks for the complimentary breakfast :) !

Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is a great hostel to stay in. this was my second time staying in this hostel. its in a great location on hollywood blvd. they run  a variety of tours from the hostel and its easy to walk to public transit to get around. the staff are friendly and helpful. there is a free continental breakfast. lockers in the rooms. they clean the rooms everyday and they have excellent security as well as parking spaces.
Colombia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"it has a good location, the free parking is a really good value. staff were friendly and helpful."
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the guy call jim e the another girl (sorry i do not remember the name) are great persons. this place is very cool, and party every day."
Norway,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,6,10,helpful staff :)
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"bathrooms are clean. my shower drain was clogged a few times, once management cleared it, the other time i cleared it myself. most people who worked for the hostel office were very kind and accommodating. having respectful roommates is the luck of the draw. i shared a room with many travelers, a german guy, &amp; australian being the most respectful. french people were good too. an italian guy, &amp; slovakians being the rudest, making uncalled for comments on my weight. i wish there was more parking."
England,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay, fun and friendly and has events to keep you busy and partying. location is ok, walk to the stars on the boulevard in 20 mins. room has kitchen and bathroom, perfect. it's clean and has great breakfast. it's not a 5 star hotel but suits the area and weather and is designed to meet people and party. super staff always helping you and offering advice and joining you on free drinks and free comedy shows. great value for money only the beds are a bit small and stiff, no biggie"
Netherlands,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"staff was very friendly and helpful. big plus that the rooms were cleaned everyday, especially the bathrooms get dirty really fast with 6 people in a room. location is very good, within walking distance of a lot of stuff. everything was really relaxed and well organised."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,8,8,6,8,6,"cons: sheets were a bit dirty, fitted sheet didn't have draw string so kept coming off the bed, blinds were broken so light came in, breakfast = extremely basic    pros: ping pong table, good location, cheap vending machine"
Italy,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"very good! maybe a little noisy by the evening but it's a friendly place!  posto davvero carino, soddisfa pienamente le aspettative, personale cordiale e bella gente, atmosfera allegra. posizione abbastanza centrale. portarsi adattatori."

India,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,the hostel is very right;y placed in hollywood right after walk of fame and access to all the food joints nearby.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,banana bungalow is one of the top social hostels i have been to. the staff are very helpful in creating a fun and entertaining atmosphere. its really as good as it gets for meeting new people from around the world. i had an unforgettable time there. there is always something going on.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"really great staff - plus the rooms are fabulous. they will assist you with anything you need. location is a bit out of the way however walking distance from a good outlook on the hollywood sign and the boulevard.  definitely a party hostel,  so i wouldn't suggest it if you want a particularly quiet one. but as a solo traveller it made it easier to meet people plus there is always something going on."
Argentina,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,the hostel is very nice and people amazing. if i come back to hollywood i would stay over again :).
Australia,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,6,4,6,4,6,as a girl i got put in a room with 4 very dodgy large men and felt very unsafe. it was extremely loud at all hours of the night and they would not give me a refund when i was not happy with my stay and left four nights early
Germany,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,8,6,8,6,6,"place is okay, but only if you like to party a lot. loud music until midnight, but quiet afterwards. i liked the fact that our dorm had its own kitchen, but the beds bunk beds were quite old and instable and when the other guy in my bunk bed moved during the night, i he would wake me up and vice versa. also the door of our dorm would could be opened from outside without a key unless locked. with 6 people sleeping in our dorm, it was virtually never locked."
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"don't miss the 'celebrity tour' they offer. okay, you hate celebrity worshipping, (so what are you doin in la!?) but, anyways, take it. mikel, the german/italian driver-guide is the funniest. besides they has a different activity every night. usually i don't like big hostels, but their activities allways help to group people.   não perca a 'celebrity tour'. ok, você odeia celebriades (então não vá pra la), mesmo assim pegue o tour. mikel o motorista-guia é o melhor."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,really happy with this hostel that i am returning for another stay when i go back to la
Denmark,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,have to say it like this.. if you want to go in bed early and early in op this is not the hostel to choose.. but if you want a awesome time and some awesome hollywood partys and nice staff this is the place
Ireland,Female,25-30,4.3,2,6,6,4,6,4,2,"would not recommend this hostel. there was an awful smell inside and it did not feel clean at all.   the location was ok, walking distance to the beach but a taxi journey to shops, bars and restaurants.   would not stay here again. "
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"a great hostel, friendly staff and guests"
Turkey,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,most comfy hostel i have ever been..
Poland,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,10,10,10,6,"great hostel for party people. every day there is something going on and it's really well done. they have a nice big patio where you can hang out at a daytime or have a party on the evening. the stuff very nice and easy going. the only small bugs were the poor breakfast and sometimes dirty bathroom ( i've seen some cockroaches there) but despite this it's very fun, very relaxing place to stay, so i can definitely recommend."
Canada,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. the rooms were great! ours had a big bathroom and a full kitchen and it was a 6 bed dorm. beds were good. but the best is the atmosphere! tons of stuff to do and the hostel had cheap or free activities every night of the week. i had a fantastic time. highly recommended!
Germany,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,i liked the stay at this hostel. our room had an own kitchen where we could cook. we even could park our car outside for free. very nice!
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,10,8,"had a great stay - no complaints. it was very nice that they organised the comedy night with free food and beers. has everything you need, staff were helpful and atmosphere was great."
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,"great layout, payed to be in a 6 bed dorm, we where put in an 8 but the room was far better than expected. great people and the hostel does their best to get everyone interacting and having fun together. do not take the celeb homes tour, we couldn't see anything from the bus and everything we where told by our driver was very out of date! go with a different company for these sorts of tours! however the nights out the staff arrange are fab! great way of meeting people."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is the best hostel i have ever stayed in and the staff are awesome! they give you free food and drinks all the time it's so good!
France,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"overall amazing stay!  nice staff (odile, the french lady, is a gem), great location, everyone is so chilled out and welcoming, i was amazed!  you feel very safe as well, i'd leave for the day and lleave my laptop on the bed without a problem 'cause i knew it'd be here when i come back, that's how safe it was! i'll definitely stay there again!   it's a bit noisy but i didn't care. i just loved it, best hostel i've ever stayed at yet!"
Germany,Couple,18-24,5.4,4,6,8,8,6,4,2,"location was good! but the rest was horrible.. the dorms were so dirty and there was much stuff and garbage lying on the floor and in the shelves! same with the bathroom, you would definitely not goin there without shoes! breakfast was okay.. they play music all night long and it's always very loud and they start again playing music at seven in the morning! so if you want at least some sleep, choose another hostel!"
Spain,Male,25-30,6,4,6,6,6,4,8,8,"my score would be higher if i hadnt had a bad experience with the guy who was in reception when i arrived, late at night (around 1am). he first said the hostel was fully booked even though i said i had a reservation, and invited me to turn around. after insisting, he finally checked my name and let me in. he asked for the keys of my car and photocopied my credit card. i asked why was that necessary, and he said: ""hostel rules, if you dont like them, there are other hostels."" rest of staff:great."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,spacious hostel. lots of european travellers to hang out with. close to the main sites. good place to stay  in hollywood!
Slovenia,Female,18-24,7.1,6,4,8,6,10,8,8,"the hostel is nice, especially because there was kitchen and bathroom in every room. breakfast is really poor and you need to pay if you want to eat yogurt. it's okay, nothing really special. the location is good, but if you're not 21 you can find cheapest hostel, because here is everything about the party. they organize party every night, but if you're not old enough you can't join."
Germany,Female,18-24,4.6,2,6,8,2,8,4,2,staff was very friendly and helpful. location was good just a couple of blocks away from the main stuff. and right on hollywood blvd.  rooms were in a bad condition and the bathrooms were very dirty. beds are very old and squeeze u can sleep very good. breakfast was ok nothing special. nust cerials and toast.  it was very noisy snd loud all night long. would't go there again
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,8,8,4,"the mattress was terrible. it was very dirty and the linen provided was average. definitely time to upgrade them... or clean the mould off. other than that, it was well organized, with a nice outdoor area and good free tours. the $10 limo ride with unlimited drinks was good..but be careful. they say entry to the club at the end is free, but when u get there the guy at the door claims its now $20 and probably takes a cut!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"i had a really good time! something is going on every night and i met many great people. the walk of fame starts only a few blocks away and public transportation is close, too (you need a car in la...). i would definitely stay there again!"
CzechRepublic,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"best of the hostels in hollywood. what makes hostel a good hostel is staff and the nice gathering place when people from all over the world can meet each other and travel together. it has the best value of money compare to the other hostels. lot of activities, great partying, bbq atc. great place to stay on hollywood blvd.  only dislike is that little tiny window cost a $40!  do not try to brake it."
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,10,8,6,"i only stayed at banana bungalow for one night, but i was very happy with the hostel. the location was great for hollywood sightseeing and the staff were very helpful. it was nice to have a kitchen and bathroom in each dorm too. there was a beach party going on the night i arrived, so it was quite noisy, but the activities offered did seem pretty good. the free breakfast was quite basic, but overall the hostel was very good value for money. i would definitely recommend banana bungalow."

Mexico,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"nice hostel in nice area, clean, well organized activities. it's kind of in the expensive side, but remember, it is on hollywood boulevard, and also, free parking!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,the banana bungalow was a great place to stay for 1 night or two but probably not more than that.  the staff were accommodating and very lovely but it was disappointing that they cancelled the sightseeing tour on the morning of.

England,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"stayed here for 3 nights and this is a vibrant hostel that always has things going on! probably not for quiet travellers as there was music and drinking going on most evenings but if, like me, that is your thing then this place is perfect. they arrange trips in the evenings and have activities going on mostly all the time. also a good mix of nationalities seem to choose this place and it is ring on hollywood boulavard and the hollywood sign is in walking distance."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,8,8,"its a nice place to stay, basically in the heart of hollywood. just a few minutes to the walk of fame and one of the best thai restaurants right next door!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,6,10,10,8,this was a pretty awesome hotel if you want to stay in hollywood. the staff are great. the atmosphere was great. there is always something arranged by the hostel to do at night which is great when travelling alone. the room was pretty clean and a pretty good size 
Switzerland,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,4,10,8,"except for the fact that the first impact was terrible (wrong and not yet cleaned room given to us, two unwilling girls at the reception), everything was fine. very good mood at this hostel, ideal to get to know to other people. small bar/club inside, basket for playing basketball, awesome the bar where breakfast is served, biliard table, parking lots inside the yard, atm, ...! you feel at home. located just 10-15 minutes from the walk of fame."

Indonesia,Male,25-30,7.7,10,8,10,6,8,6,6,"the staff were friendly. the location was very good. how to use the washing machine and laundry was quite confusing first, though. i put $2.00 to buy a $1.50 drink and i didn't get any change."

Malaysia,Male,,8.9,10,10,6,10,8,10,8,"the facilities in the dorm is great, complete with kitchenette, sitting area, place to hang wet towel and good water pressure, except the bed seem shaky and mattress was too soft to give back pain. located in hollywood boulevard street and near to subway station. staffs were friendly and helpful. i have bad experience with the disneyland trip that booked with them, tour center did not believe i have paid transport charged as hostel forgot paid to them, so remember to get receipt whenever paid."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"solo traveller, stayed in 6 bed dorm. i loved everything about this hostel! the name is what caught my eye when making my booking.  the people i met, the organised social events, the kitchen/bathrooms in the rooms even a tv in the room. the rooms are cleaned everyday. staff are friendly. great thanks, i will be coming back and recommending :)"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"pretty good hostel, lots of activities etc, the room had a small kitchen in it, breakfast was good.  my only complaint is that the bunk bed i had was super shaky and whenever the person in the bed below moved the whole thing swung like crazy.  they should consider securing the beds or replacing them with sturdier framed beds.  the location was good (la is a big sprawl though obviously), but there are a lot of strange people in the area!"
France,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this is one of the best hostel i've ever stayed in! this is litterally perfect, the staff was very helpfull and all the tours and activities were great ! i totally recommend it"
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,10,10,10,6,8,4,6,"great location!  location and secure parking were really the best part of this hostel for me.  the staff were also very nice/helpful and i appreciated the passcode security access to the hostel.  dorms were simple, but included a kitchenette and bathroom.  dorm bed was comfy enough, breakfast was available (cereal, bread/spreads, and coffee/tea), and the tiki lounge area was cute.  it's not my favorite hostel, but i would absolutely stay again if in the hollywood area."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,nice hostel in an excellent location. been there for only two nights and i was a really awesome part of my trip!
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the place is great, something on every night ad easy to get to places from there. had issues with a creepy guy making the girls in the room uncomfortable but the staff were fantastic in resolving the situation and removing him."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is super rad! one of the best ones ive stayed at. it has the perfect southern california vibe, and is in a great location. subway only couple blocks away. trader joes also super close. the rooms are very spacious, equipped with kitchen space. i really liked the tiki lounge as well. the place has everything you need and more. will definitely stay there again when i go back to los angeles."
Turkey,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my time in banana bungalow. the hostel is nice. they clean the rooms everyday and try to organize different events. especially tuesday nights are great, lots of free food and drinks. some nights are really fun but some nights can be very quiet too. the only problem is the location. hollywood is really not a nice area to stay. it might be a better idea to spend some days close to the beach."
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"genuinely really liked this hostel, really glad i stayed. the staff were lovely, there is a massive courtyard area with ping pong, pool, tv and computers, and there are daily events on at the hostel like karaoke, party buses. its a good place to meet people. i would go back."
Germany,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i would recommend banana bungalow to my friends. all said!
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,10,4,"great hostel, good location.  the room had a lot of space, though it could use cleaning, particularly beneath the fridge and sofas.  the staff was very friendly and the trips were very well organized and worth it."
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great hostel! awesome parties, everybody on the staff was very receptive, i had a great time!"
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"im from argentina, i spend 3 days there itss a grat hostel i would go back.  itsa great place to know people becaouse every night the hostel organize some bbq o pizza or somethink where you dinner with all the people of the hostel.  i didnt like very much the location of the hostel because if you walk to one side was the hollywood blvd an its nice walk, but if you go to the other side was more poor.  i never had some problem and arrived every night late at door.  very safty inside   regards!"
England,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,the only criticism i would have is that the sheets provided for the beds are not warm enough. we were provided with a thin sheet to sleep under and as a result were freezing every night. something more substantial is required.
England,Female,31-40,6.6,8,6,10,6,6,6,4,"hostel could be amazing, but staff are indifferent and they don't market trips/evenings out etc well enough.  location is excellent though, right on hollywood blvd.  rooms averagely clean, with limited kitchen items (e.g. 1 mug for a room for 8 people, no glasses or cutlery, so not really a kitchen!!)."
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,women staff could really work ib friendluess and customer service.
Thailand,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"excellent location, and very pleasant staff.  the hostel offers travelers who like to be in a place where there are ""lots of things to do"" and a party atmosphere."
Brazil,Female,25-30,7.1,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,"good to have a place to park the car, but sometimes it was blocked by another car. the room i stayed had a kitchen with microwave and refrigerator, but the carpet was really dirty. the lockers are really small, only for documents and a small purse. the breakfast is ok, but on saturday i arrived 30 minutes before it was over,  and there wasn't any bread or cereal. the karaoke night is fun, but it is really loud in the rooms. i recommend it if you have a car, but you can't be much picky."
USA,Male,25-30,6,6,4,8,8,4,6,6,"the hostel itself was decent.    my buddy ""lost"" his phone there, but someone in the hostel ""found"" it later. they offered to return it, but it's been almost two weeks and he still hasn't received it. don't trust the staff to get your stuff back to you, at least in a timely manner, if you forget anything there.    room was nice, and the general atmosphere was good. parking availability was a definite plus."
France,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was perfect, we met a lot of people and the hostel had a lof of activities."
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,6,10,meet some awesome people there!
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,10,10,6,6,6,4,all round good hostel if you are on a budget. i left one night early and checked into a hotel. my room was just freezing and really dirty. a few bad things like holes in towels and the bath was always full of water. no proper blankets and full of holes. if they invested in some new linen i would stay again. great access to hollywood blvd. a little scary at night but  good location for your first time in la. wifi in the room a bonus and lots of shops and restaurants nearby.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is amazing stayed here twice and i will be back next time im in la always friendly people working and fun people staying here, music playing pool table and ping pong where i was taught to play beer pong bloody brilliant! the place has recently changed hands but is still vibrant and fun, the new owner seems to be much more organized and is doing alot of work on the place, he is lots of fun and a great source for hollywood tips. so close to all the best shopping, aswell as good clubs"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great place! i was only there for two nights and was really tired after long flights so didn't party with the rest of the place, but it sounded fun. great vibe around the place. was close to all the sights and was just a funky little place to be!! would highly recommend!!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was cleaner than some pricey hotels ive stayed in. the housekeeping was friendly and those ladys did an awsome job.  most of the staff was very nice, fun and helpful.  they offer a lot of activites for day and nighttime. and even when it is a slow time,they try to arrange fun activities.  some nights i wished the staff would care about sleeping guests. 4am wasted guys screaming, knocking at every door, i hope somone would have told them to shut up. i tried but they would not listen."
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,great value for the money! nothing to complain! id stay there again!!! ;) the other bungalow is more party!!!
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the hostel is great. there is kitchen and bathroom inside the dorm, so it's pretty practical. the only thing that i didn't like was the size of the lockers, because they are too small. they have lots of activities, it's pretty fun to stay there."
Canada,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"pros:  middle of the action. if you don't have a car, this is the hostel for you.    cons:  they charge 5 dollars for using credit cards!! that's weird."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent hostel
Canada,Female,18-24,5.4,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,"the staff were somewhat cold. this really is a ""party"" hostel, as in, it feels like the first day of college with all the people you met....first day of college. so, if that floats your boat, then rock on! but really, a place can be a ""party"" without feeling like a frat house which is definitely not what i was looking for on my trip"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,good spot and friendly staff. they really make an effort to get people involved and having a good time
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"good location and nice staff.  nice room and the bed is ok  good entertainment facilities  the only thing bad is the music loud at night until 10:30 or 11:00, so unless u like to party at night it would be difficult to rest before the music stops."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,great hostel. good atmosphere and lots of partying to be done with something on every night of the week. not great if you were looking for something super quiet but great location!!

USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"there is really nothing negative to say.  it's extremely clean, parking is available, basic breakfast is free and in room kitchens are a plus.  kudos to the cleaning staff.  they take pride in their work!  walking distance to the walk of fame, jimmy kimmel live and griffith park.  the only thing i'd suggest is make sure you've got your earplugs if you want to go to sleep early.  the thai restaurant next door is excellent."
Sweden,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,8,10,6,"it was definately worth the money staying here, although i would not recommend it to families with chilren as it's a partyplace. they've got free wifi, parking and breakfast which is always nice, and most of the staff is really helpful. great location!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"i did enjoy the way this hostel was set out so different,y to all the other hostels i have stayed in, and it had a really cool vibe and offered a lot of different activities for people to get involved in. i met some very cool people during my stay here and everything was generally very good however they only offer 1 sheet to sleep with and it was freezing at night although i did ask for extra sheets later in my stay which were given to me with no problems at all."
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,4.9,4,6,6,4,4,6,4,"the room was not so clean. the bed were really bad, too old furniture. it's ok to sleep for one night, no more then two."

Australia,Female,31-40,6.9,8,6,6,8,6,6,8,pros - very clean.  comfie bed.  parking.  some staff helpful.  cons - loud music until midnight on friday.  some staff not terrible but definitely not friendly.  wifi not great.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,great atmosphere an the staff were friendly
Singapore,Male,31-40,6.6,8,6,6,8,4,8,6,a couple of the female staffs are kinda impatient when you ask them more than one question. seems very reluctant to help you. didn't feel very welcome during check in. customer service is below average.
France,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,the location is great but the atmosphere is not that good and the staff is not really friendly.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"friendly staff, great party place"
Canada,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,6,10,8,i had an absolute blast. lots of planned activities and met some wonderful people from around the globe.
China,Male,,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,that is a very good experience to stay in your hostel!:)
Norway,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,10,8,8,4,"i visited banana bungalow in september, excellent time of the year - but there are alot of ants in the bathroom. meet some nice people, ejoyd the karaokenight and the comedy and bbq together with the sister hostel in west hollywood. some of the people that work there are really nice!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,6,8,10,6,10,6,events every night were incredible
Colombia,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,"i generally liked this hostel. there was a problem with my reservation though, and i ended up sleeping with the staff in the staff room, which is pretty crowded (10 people). in the end i didn't care that much, because they were lovely people! i didn't like the girl in the reception room because she was not helpful at all, and she just limited to checking you in but didn't help you on getting around and the other services the hostel had. however, other staff members did, so thank god for them!"
Portugal,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,very nice staff and atmosphere.
Brazil,Female,25-30,2.6,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is terrible!!!!!!!! the atmosphere is just really weird, i didn't feel safe or comfortable there. when i first got into the room, that was supposed to be clean, the bath was filled with a dirty water, i don't know for how long....the staff is not the nicest one. when i decided to leave, they didn't give my money back.   if you're looking for a nice hostel to relax after sightseeing all day, don't stay here."
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,"helpful staff, huge room, excellent facilities, free breakast, loads of organised stuff including bike hire and bar outings, plus the layout of the place lent itself to meeting new people (rooms surround a courtyard with table football, etc.) v positive experience!  shower could do with unblocking tho!"
England,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,free internet is very slow and breakfast is basic. used to be a motel which detracts a little from the backpacker vibe and makes it a bit harder to get to know people. near transport links but best to rent a car because public transport in la is terrible!
England,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,4,8,8,8,8,"good atmosphere, friendly staff. the trips organised by the hostel are good. the room was really clean however, it was awfully hot at times- there was just one rotating fan so at night time on the top bunk it was pretty toasty. also, the location of the hostel isn't great, especially if you don't have a car."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"good location.  secure car parks available was a plus. staff nice. tours and activities available. shared bathroom in dorms suited well. was in a 4 bed dorm, but really sharing the bathroom with another 4 bed dorm also,, so 8 all up for 1 shower and toilet together. breakfast was prompt and friendly, however not too much in the way of healthy options if that matters. overall would stay again."
Australia,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is pathetic. the staff are unhelpful and vague, the security is non-existant (my girlfriend and i came back to the dorm at 10pm only to find the door wide open &amp; that our bags had been tampered with by the random ppl that were still in the room drinking although they werent staying there). i had to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend as someone had stolen my bedding (and bed). the shower didnt work, there was no air-con or fan &amp; there were insects everywhere. do not stay here!!"
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the hostel, if travelling by metro, is a bit of a trek away from the station with a large suitcase. otherwise, it is in a good position for hollywood blvd and all it has to offer! i really enjoyed my stay here and met some great people."
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very central location...close to everything!great atmosphere and nights out planned
Australia,MixedGroup,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,stayed here with y family 6 people ages from 10 up was great we all had a great. time n would stay here again. highly recommend for families on a budget. not much variety for breakfast but the friendly staff compensated this with there friendly welcoming attitude thank you  banana a bungalow.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,8,had a good stay overall. some staff members were an exceptional help others were not willing to help which was disappointing. the atmosphere was friendly though and the activities were a good touch. the breakfast was good every morning. my bed felt like it was going to fall apart everytime i rolled over or the girl in the bunk above me did. but i was happy with our kitchen and bathroom area of the room. thai place next door was a great bonus cheap and great meals that are big!
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel! best i've ever stayed in! clean bedrooms and bathrooms, helpful staff and lots of fun activities. highly recommended!"
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"nice place to stay :) location is good, beds are very clean, there is enough room to hang out with other guests, sunny place on the roof terrace."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,drinking allowed made it easy to mingle. the big courtyard at the bottom was full of people. the location was a little bit out of the way so if your not fond of walking bad luck. i personally didn't mind.  but a very good choice overall.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"great hostel, the west hollywood one was a bit nicer though"
Finland,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"noisy party at the inner courtyard, but everything else was just perfect. also having your own kitchen in your own dorm was perfect!"
Belgium,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i had an amazing stay!  everything was perfect! the only problem, i was very cold at night without any blanket"
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"very loud; try to get the dorm in the back if you need to sleep early. otherwise, it's awesome. lots going on, many connections to la sites and many fun things at the hostel itself."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,6,6,8,10,8,8,8,"nothing to complain about. free breakfast, activities every day, met a lot of interesting people. don't plan on spending all that much time on the beach, because you will need well over an hour to get there."

Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"we absolutely adord this hostel. los angeles is a tough place for a first timer, as everything is spaced out and it's tough to knwo what's good. the staff were super helpful and the promoters gave us something fun to do every single night. the atmosphere was awesome and within five days we had made life long friends purley because the hostel and promoters were on their game and ensured it was the most social place to be even on a boring week night. free drinks, free tacos and pizza &amp; a free limo"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,10,6,8,"noise (from outdoor ping/beer pong, karaoke, drinkers) extends on until very late at night, on all nights.  so my only warning to travellers is that this is not the place for you if you intend on sleeping and waking early.  otherwise, brilliant value for money, great local and very clean."
Vietnam,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,8,4,"the room is very dirty, especially the kitchen and the restroom. when we moved in, we saw a lot of unwashed bowls and dishes in the sink. also the kitchen smelled funny."

Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,4,10,10,8,we had a shared bathroom in a 8 bed dorm which really was poor! there was stuff nobody knew who it belongs to! the drain was almost blocked and we couldnt use the toilette for 2 days!  good that we were drunk most of the time so we didnt care a lot :-)    besides that the stay was great!
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,5.4,6,6,6,4,6,6,4,"booked in a 6 bed room., got put in an 8 bed. other roomies were in &amp; out, drunk, arguing.while partying is expected in hostels, this was ridiculous. extremely inconsiderate, especially if you've just travelled for almost 18 hrs &amp; want some sleep. shower head didnt work &amp; sprayed all through the bathroom. heater did not work &amp; nights were very cold. no blankets provided. kind of in the ghetto part of hollywood, bit of a hike to the walk of fame"
HongKong,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,8,10,an awesome hostel~!
Belgium,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i stayed 3 months in la and been there in most of the hostels out there. this hostel is by far the second best hostel in all of la. only to be topped by the bananabungalow in west hollywood.     thomas
Peru,Male,25-30,7.7,10,6,8,8,8,8,6,"excellent location  but some people were very noisy until very late ( 1am-2am) in weekdays  also i liked the free internet, breakfast and pizza they offered."

Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location right on the strip near all hollywood attractions, great staff encoraging welcoming knowledgable available, activities everday and night.  the hollywood tour was great intro to all things hollywood and a great way to get around.  great open set up."

Slovenia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.3,4,8,8,6,8,8,2,the hostel has very good character. i found it very interesting.
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,8,8,4,very very loud music at night...never once slept a whole night through.even asking the dj to turn it down because the beds were vibrating! not even ear plugs blocked it out. otherwise a great hostel if u dont plan on sleeping.
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"this hostel has a great vibe and is very easy to meet people. i really liked that each room had its own kitchen and bathroom, so even though you are sharing with people, you feel like you have your own space. i would recommend this place, especially to lone travelers."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"a good hostel if you're looking to meet people and party. something on and organised each night for travellers e.g. karaoke, comedy night, taco night, pub crawl.   so probably not for you if you want to have a quiet night!  breakfast is average - 2 pieces of bread and cereal, but keeps you full i guess.  room was okay with kitchen, bathroom and tv.   location was good for hollywood, not too far to walk to kodak theatre and mann's chinese theatre.  great cheap thai restaurant next door!!"
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,6,10,10,10,staying at banana bungalow hollywood was very nice ! :) staffs were also kind. thank you so much.
England,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"i stayed in a 6 bed mixed dorm, it was ensuite and it's own kitchen and cable tv. the breakfast was basic but good and the facilities and helpfulness of staff were excellent. my only issue was the noise at night, there were people in the communal area down in the courtyard playing table-tennis and screeching and laughing until gone 1am. maybe the owners should put a cut off time for outdoor activities."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"was the best hostel i have ever stayed in, activities everynight which made it easy to meet people as i was trevelling on my own"

NewZealand,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,10,8,8,8,the best hostel ive stayed in so far in my 7 weeks in america. will definitely stay there again next time im in la
Hungary,Male,31-40,6.7,0,6,4,0,10,6,8,"the room and the bed was clean and the staff were very helpful. the neighborhood of the hostel is nice daytime, but not very safe in the night. i had just one problem, about the computers... they stopped responding many times and it was impossible to restart or logout of the used sites. this way somebody entered to my facebook account and made an inapproppriate entry on my wall under my name! i think it is unecceptable. i suggest to repair the computers, else the guests will go to another hostel"
Albania,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"very good hostel , free breakfast everyday , clean , nice partyyy , limo tour ; free diner 2 times a week , staff very helpful, good location : hollywood boulevard; very good hostel !!!!!! i really enjoyed stayin there !!!!"

Australia,Couple,25-30,8,0,10,6,0,6,8,8,the hostel was well set up with a nice outdoor area and courtyard.  could have had better bedding (the blankets werent good) and it was a bit of a walk from the kodak theatre part of hollywood bvd and most the staff weren{t too interested in helping too much
France,Female,31-40,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"good prestations, good breakfast"
Australia,Female,41+,5.3,0,6,8,0,2,6,4,female staff who checked us in was very pleasant &amp; helpful. another female staff during our stay was very rude &amp; was not approachable or helpful. i would not recommend this place to anyone. i feel the only benefit of staying at banana bungalow was the location.
Germany,Male,41+,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,"it´s a nice hostel in los angeles - hollywood according to this price. i would highly recommend to stay in this hostel. nearly central, with an metro+bus connection within 400 meters away from the hostel. only 3 computers with free internet access, but free wifi. there are free lockers in the rooms and a free continental breakfast, beware of your shuttle bus receipt (the drivers will only give you a receipt if you hustle them), otherwise you get no money for this transfer back !!!"
SouthAfrica,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,8,10,10,great place to stay; the rooms are very clean and the extra (free) services provided by the hostel are fantastic!!! will definitely stay again if i return to la.

Brazil,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,6,10,10,"the hostel is great! definatelly a place to have fun! i've met a lot o great people and never felt bored because we always had things to do that the hostel itself programmed. some of the staff is very rude and make u feel like they doing a favor! but  is great, specially if you're traveling alone!"
France,Female,25-30,6.7,0,6,8,0,6,6,6,"location and character are ok, but the parties organized by the hostel staff are really loud and up to very late in the night. the rooms are not sound-proof so if you want to have a good night rest, don't go to this hostel. also, the parties occur on the hostel's parking lot, so you have to find your own parking space (in the streets) on party nights."
Bulgaria,Male,31-40,8.3,0,8,10,0,6,10,6,"an excellent place to stay in la. has a very good vibe, perfect location and there is always something going on. the only thing to degrade my impressions was the reception manager. this blond big lady was extremely unfriendly and rude at some stages. so my advice is to keep all your quireies and requests for when godzila is out of the office!   i will definitely stay there again!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.3,0,8,8,0,6,8,8,"its a motel/hostel but it has a tv room, chillout room and a good area in the court yard to meet people.  the staff were a little quiet but not rude except the people who work on the tours who were really nice &amp; loved to chat. each rooms door locked and they had lockers inside. the room were clean but the kitchen needed more cups and equipment.  i had a great time there and meet people to go out to do stuff together, the location is good though its hard to move around la using public transport"
France,Female,25-30,7.7,0,4,10,0,6,10,8,nice location and clean enough. could use new lock on the door so you don't have to use the key to lock it tough because of that my dorm ended up open  all the time.
France,Male,18-24,5.3,0,8,8,0,2,4,6,"hostel with free parking near the walk of fame and shops. but staff not really friendly. during my trip i did three hostel , and that staff is the worse one. not even a smile"
Australia,Female,25-30,5,0,6,6,0,2,6,4,"terrible hostel. directions are incorrect (not walking distance from coach station at all, its in a totally different location). dutch girl behind reception is completely rude and unhelpful. the rooms were ok but with old mattresses and cleaning staff are not thorough at all.  still, the main problem here is the loud events (such as karaoke) on wed &amp; fri when it's impossible to sleep (even with earplugs). was so loud the police were called &amp; still no action from staff. do not stay!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.3,0,6,10,0,6,8,6,"good location, very nice fun, things to do every night, good bed, room, place! i really like it..."
England,Male,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,10,6,"a great hostel for partying but if you want a quiet nights sleep i would advise against it. the location was excellent and the nights out are very good as well. but there were some signs of bed bugs in one of my rooms beds. all in all, good but loud"
France,MixedGroup,18-24,3.7,0,2,4,0,6,4,2,"bedrooms dirty (smeling feet !), bathroom disgusting, and staff not really smiling."
Croatia,Couple,25-30,6.3,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,"the hostel is ok. breakfast was good. our room was not so clean (especially bathroom and kitchen), and in the kitchen there was not enough spoons and forks."
Germany,Male,18-24,7.3,0,6,6,0,8,10,6,"great hostel for this price and for young people. they have enough places to spend time, to meet new people and to stay with other guests even after midnight.    location is right on the end of the wof. hollywood in walking distance. organized trips and stuff are great.    hygienic are okay and the banana bungalow has a nice charme."
Belgium,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"amazing hostel, had a great time!! nothing to complain about, just perfect."
Germany,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,6,0,6,8,8,"it is a funny, cool and a clean place for young people. they offer many activities like tours, partys and barbecues and the staff is very helpful."
Brazil,Female,25-30,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,"i tried to call them my whole sunday to cancel my reservation and kept getting the message: the machine is off.  if i can contact them, i don´t think they are worth of a review..."
Germany,MixedGroup,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"we really enjoyed our time there, met a lot of people and they were awesome !!! we'll come back for sure !"
England,Male,18-24,7,0,8,6,0,8,8,6,owned by the same crew as orbit hostel and with largely the same vibe. great social events and helpful staff with plenty of organised sightseeing activities on offer. could be cleaner and the location was decent-close to bus stops and a short drive from anywhere you might want to go.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"fun atmosphere. the hostel always provides activites each night if you want to be involved. decent bathroom and kitchen facility, if only other roommates keep it clean!"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.3,0,6,4,0,6,8,8,"the location is not great.  the website says that there is a shuttle to take you to venice and santa monica beach but this is actually not true.  when i asked about the shuttle the staff said there is no shuttle and told me that to get to venice or santa monica i would have to take two different public buses and it would take well over an hour.  if i had known this i would not have stayed here, perhaps they should update their internet site and not pretend to offer services that dont exist."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,8,the room had an ensuite and a little kitchenette and tv so i was impressed. it could have been a little closer to the bit of hollywood boulevard that we wanted to see but i did not feel unsafe in the area and it was within walking distance.
USA,Female,18-24,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel and a brilliant location. hostel provides lots of activities and tours, including the city tour which was fantastic!"
England,Couple,25-30,4.3,0,2,6,0,6,4,4,we booked two nights but didn't even stay one night due to drugs and strangers being brought into our room. we left immediately.
England,Female,18-24,8.3,0,10,6,0,8,8,10,"the parties with other hostel is a great way to meet other travellers, loved the hollywood tour but its way over priced compared to other ones offered down the road, seems to jujst be taking advantage of the fact your not sure where's best to go. the who did the tour was great though with great insider knowledge of l.a"
NorthernIreland,Female,18-24,8,0,10,10,0,6,6,10,"music is very loud and runs late into the night. staff can be very rude, esp the night time guard who told me i should be in bed when i returned one evening"
Australia,Couple,31-40,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,6,"the usage of the internet, the tv room, the ping pong table was all good but the loud band right outside everyone's rooms till 1am was terrible. there is an area at the back of the hostel...do it there or not at all!"
England,Female,18-24,8.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,10,brilliant hostel for the price!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"really fun place, staff are really helpful and frinedly, great location on hollywood blvd-right next to subway station and walkable (bout 15 mins) distance to chinese/kodak theatres. free breakfast, internet and often free dinner and beer too! would definitely stay there again!"
England,Couple,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,"a good hostel in a great location. just a short walk to all the happenings on hollywood blvd. the hostel was clean and had lots to keep you entertained (table football, pool, movie nights, free internet) the free bbq on a sunday wasnt up to much, food was cold when served and not a great choice but suppose it was free!"
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,this place has a real american feel about it and is in a fantastic location. nice rooms with ensuite and kitchen in all ot them. staff are friendly and helpful and there are lots of events orgainsed.
Australia,Couple,25-30,7,0,8,6,0,8,6,8,location was a bit out of the way if you want to walk to hollywood sites.  dorms came equipped with kitchenette which could have been handy if needed.  reasonable for a 1 night stop over in la.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"very clean &amp; right on hollywood bvld. staff were really friendly &amp; helpful, our room was nice &amp; clean. they had alot of activites going on, its just a shame we couldn't do any of them."
Australia,Female,18-24,7,0,8,8,0,8,6,6,"good location and friendly staff, bit run down though."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,4,10,10,"over all our stay was good. lots of party and social nights with free beer which was really good but very noisy at night if you are trying to sleep. the rooms were cool with their own kitchen and bathroom that is cleaned everyday. my sister ended up with bed bug bites which was a massive downer. the staff there didn't seem happy to be working there at all, constantly hungover and just rude i thought, but one german girl who was very friendly. the la tour was really good. an ok place to stay."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,0,6,8,0,6,6,4,"good location, free internet.  that about sums it up."
England,Male,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"very good hostel, there are alot of activities, usually involving free beer! clean and good few things to do!"
England,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i absolutely loveeeeeeee this hostel, i stayed in this one and the west hollywood and they are both amazing, i stayed way longer than i had planned too but it was just so much fun i couldn't leave!"
Slovenia,Male,18-24,8.7,0,10,10,0,6,10,6,"a fun hostel with lots of stuff to do. there's a basketball hoop and a ping pong table, tv, internet, tiki garden... everything one can think of, basically. staff was ok but not as genuinely kind as at some other places. location is very convenient for exploring hollywood. rooms are kind of oldish but good enough. free parking is very cool and a big plus!"
England,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,8,nice hostel in a good location! much better than the banana bungalow in west hollywood!
Australia,Male,41+,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,8,10,"this place is quite a find actually. very well priced for what you get. yes a tiny bit out of the way but very well served by the red line and the buses. clean as well. plenty of things to do. i would say stay here for sure, though noise doesnt get down until midnight so bring earplugs if you want to sleep before then."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at this hostel! the staff were great and really friendly, the rooms were spacious and clean, and there were activities day and night. i would definitely recommend, and definitely stay again!"
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,6,10,4,"if you want to sleep, don't go there! the location is perfect though, 5 minutes walking time from the walk of fame, bus stop at the corner, parking inside....  it's not super clean &amp; some of the staff are means, but some of them are amazingly nice.... i would stay there again which means it was not so bad!"
England,Female,25-30,8.3,0,6,10,0,8,10,6,"definitely one of the craziest hostels i've stayed in but all in a good way.  wednesday night = free beer &amp; hot dogs = great way to meet/talk to people at the hostel = fun night!!  if you're a light sleeper though, the mayhem may disturb your sleep but the en suite rooms make up for that."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,this hostel was alot of fun
Australia,Female,18-24,4,0,6,6,0,4,4,2,the bathtub was blocked so you were literally bathing in other peoples filth! the rooms were in a terrible mess and the bed was so itchy.
England,Female,18-24,7.7,0,6,6,0,10,8,8,"i liked this hostel for the people that i met more than anything. everything was pretty average really. the location was ok, but not the best. the beds weren't particularly comfortable, and the sheets/blankets that i was given had holes in them. the facilities were fair, there were a lot of computers, and the tv room is set out like a mini cinema, which is pretty cool. lots of tours and outings done throughout the week. nights out weren't as many as expected but the one's i did go on were good."
Australia,Male,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,8,10,8,fun hostel if you're young or travelling solo. lots of activties organinsed by the staff. close to facilites etc. i reccommend this hostel

France,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,10,10,2,10,"good: very clean, safe, great location, good staff.  bad: no social atmosphere at all, no one talks to each other; the handle to my bedroom was broken, so other residents were banging on the door at 3, 4, and 5 am to get in. alcohol is not allowed in the premises."
Japan,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,everything is good but the number of bathrooms. i wanna use here when i come to santa monica again. you should try here.
England,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing location with great facilities and friendly staff. thanks!
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"chose this hostel as a place to stay during a 14 hour layover. i had no issues, the staff was so friendly. location was perfect near the pier and there is a bus around the corner that took me right back to the airport for only $1.25! "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"overall a great stay and a nice hostel!   everything is clean and super modern!   showers are super nice ..    but the breakfast is not good.. they call it „zero waste“ but they serve toast packed separately in a plastic thing... orange juice, only cornflakes, milk, butter, peanut butter and blueberry jam that’s it.. fresh fruits are bananas nothing more.. a bit disappointing     still the location is great, 1min to the beach, 5 to the pier so just petfect! "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is the best i have stayed at in los angeles and i’ve stayed at a few in the past two weeks. clean rooms, sturdy beds, power points at every bed, locker. lots of places to sit and relax, lots of activities. it’s a great place. will only be staying with hi going forward across the us. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely as advertised, great environment and facilities, awesome location in santa monica, would stay again!"
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"easily one of the best hostels i’ve ever stayed at!!! clean, friendly, safe and so close to santa monica pier!"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"only stayed here for a night, but it was a great experience. super clean, spacious, convenient and the staff was really nice. not many breakfast options for someone who is gluten free/dairy free, but pretty much everywhere in la is good for that, so i survived. would definitely stay again!"
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was more than impressed with this hostel, a great facility! made my stay so wonderful! amazing location, security was top notch, very modern and updated facilities, and extremely clean!"
USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"this hostel treated us pretty well. the location is top notch - you are only one block away from the beach and surrounded by restaurants and shopping. security was great. free breakfast included. parking was quite expensive in the garage across the street, i’d recommend looking for alternatives. met a few cool other travelers here, wish i could’ve stayed another night or two. my only complaint is the bathrooms were a bit far around the corner from my dorm room."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location and activities on offer here. everything was clean and function, the only slight negative was the price (fairly high for a shared dorm), however it was in line with the rest of available accomodation in la. overall, definitely recommend this place to a traveller looking for a fun hostel in a cool area. "
Argentina,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely great location! only one shower was actually fantastic, the rest kinda meh.. met great people, thanks to the pubcrawl and the good breakfast. i would totally recommend it if travelling alone and looking to meet other travelers. "
Scotland,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"you can't really beat the location here as it's perhaps a couple of blocks from the pier, metro, and not much further to the big blue bus to/from the airport.  it's not a place with a party atmosphere, but it's clean, quiet, provides a basic breakfast and has excellent kitchen facilities for storing and cooking you own food.  only slight issues are that the beds creak too much.  every time you move, they seem to shake and creak and can be quite noisy.  the privacy curtain could be full length.  "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"10/10  super close to the beach, 3rd street promenade, santa monica pier.  clean bathrooms, comfortable cots, large lockers, free breakfast (cereal + toast + jam + pb + coffee/oj/tea/milk).  "
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,8,6,4,8,"quiet hours were not respected. there were people outside our room swearing and fighting around 2:00 am, which made it impossible to sleep. it was a great location but i hated sleeping here and would not go back."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"really great location in the heart of santa monica, clean and modern facilities as well as comfortable beds. would recommend staying in a private room. "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel. comfy common area, great staff always at the front desk &amp; happy to help with anything. the location is a block from the beach and right near heaps of shops &amp; restaurants. the rooms were clean with large lockers. love the individual lights &amp; chargers for each bed. breakfast was fine, good way to save some money. internet worked really well. met lots of travellers. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i have stayed in!  great staff, very clean, well designed and a fantastic location near everything the area has to offer.  the only downside is the new beds are very noisy when people toss and turn (ear plugs help with that!).  even with that i would still give this hostel a 10/10 and will definitely be back!"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was the perfect location for sightseeing when we had downtime from our business meetings.  the facilities and amenities were an added bonus to our trip.  would absolutely recommend and hope to stay here again! 
Germany,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was the best hostel stay i have ever had. the location is amazing and the hostel itself was renovated and really nice and clean.
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place, great location, clean and comfortable beds, good staff and nice people"
SouthKorea,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"i stayed 8 female’s room, it was really clean and comfortable. if i visit to here once again, i will definitely choose this hostel without any consider."
NorthernIreland,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,excellent ! great hostel in a brilliant location.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very convenient and reasonable
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,rooms were super hot/air conditioner wasn't working so very uncomfortable to sleep especially on top bunk. other than that everything else was great! 
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"clean, friendly staff, awesome location.  there didn't seem to be much mingling in the downstairs area though. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,great location and a comfy stay! only thing is maybe a better breakfast. besides that all good.
Poland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,10,8,8,10,very good location! stuff was helpfull and friendly. i liked the hostel and the free breakfast
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing hostel, very clean and newly renovated! i would highly recommend this place! the location is great too"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"great location, so close and central to santa monica pier and shops. rooms clean. only two showers to share on the floor with lots of people. staff were friendly."
England,Female,41+,5.1,2,10,10,6,2,2,4,"my reservation was confirmed by expedia and by the hostel, but when i turned up at the hostel the male staff prevented my entry   and cancelled my reservation without prior warning, because i had criticised the conditions in the hostel during my previus stay as the ongoing construction wark, the dust and the extreme cold caused by the disfunctional cooling machine in the room gave me a terrible cough and i had to go to the hospital as a result.     "
Sweden,Female,25-30,7.4,8,10,8,8,6,6,6,nice hostel but a bit boring if you’re looking to meet people. 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"stayed at hi santa monica for two nights in an all female dorm. aside from the renovations taking place from early morning, this was a great hostel located in prime spot. one street away from ocean ave and short walk to santa monica pier. opposite direction you have the promenade of shops. but stop close by as well. beds were decent, bathroom was clean and they have great daily activities going on. pretty happy with my stay and would come back again."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,8,6,4,10,"location of the hostel is great, shopping nearby with decent places to eat. santa monica pier about 5-10 minute walk away. breakfast basic with cereal, bananas, bread and coffee. one point i'd make though would be to switch to just regular loaves of bread. each slice was wrapped in its own plastic. what a waste! rooms, bathrooms all new and clean, big plus! however place lacks atmosphere. good if you want to get out and explore, but probably not the best for meeting people. "
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"i previously stayed at hi santa monica back in 2014 and i vowed to return if i came back.  i liked staying there previously,and i liked my stay this time as well as it was close to everything on santa monica.  i look forward to seeing the place after the renovations have been completed when i return to los angeles again someday."
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"execellent location. two blocks from the santa monica beach and a block from the 3rd street promenade. public transit is also a short walk away. the rooms were clean, but the walls are thin and i can hear construction workers talking in the next room that’s under renovation at 7am in the morning. the social atmosphere was nonexistent as the hostel is somewhat big and not as intimate as smaller hostels. the free breakfast wasn’t much to speak of, just toast and cereal. "
USA,Female,18-24,5.4,4,6,8,4,6,4,6,"i only stayed for a couple of nights; aside from assistance in finding weekend parking, i was not impressed. it wasn't bad, though the breakfast selection was literally thin slices of bread in hard plastic. the kitchen was large, but nothing inviting to draw people in (colors/labels directly next to fridge/""bottom barrel"" coffee). and the wifi was often inconsistent (when it even decides to function at all) guests should have access for a free drop off shuttle service.     ok hostel. not great. "
Canada,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,great location! right near the beach and restaurants. there were daily activities to take part in too which was great. good transit service to the area which can get you anywhere in los angeles. the bathroom was always crowded and usually a line up for the shower. 
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i've been familiar with santa monica for a long time but no longer live in the area. this was my first time at this facility and although one floor was closed for construction it looks like they made some upgrades on the floor where i stayed. common areas  are nice, lockers in rooms(bring a padlock to save a $5.00 rental fee)  good temperature control,  staff were friendly and helpful. walking distance to lots of places of interest, shopping if that's your thing, beach very close. i'll be back."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great stay, with excellent location. simply love staying here every time i'm in la. second best hi hostel (after boston) that i've been to! "
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,6,8,4,4,4,6,6,"the staff were rude during my stay and not helpful at all, just gave me my room key and made me sign the paper without even telling me where things within the hostel were located. hostel is on a very noisy street and the walls in the room arent very good as you can hear the next rooms conversations and everything going on. my room wasnt that clean either, very disappointed in my stay.  "
Singapore,Male,41+,6.6,4,10,10,2,10,6,4,wi-fi at level 3 sucks. toilets are dirty.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this has an amazing location 5 min from the beach. i arrived here at 2 in the morning please people just uber eats cause there are homeless people roaming around. facilities are great i think they need more group activities because everyone is to themselves. over all amazing experience i’d love to recommend people stoping over to come here santa monica is gorgeous 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"since the hostel has been remodeled, i love it. the restrooms are amazing! thank you so much for the upgrade. "
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my experience at hi santa monica hostel was great! the location is very good, you can go to the pier by walking, it's also next to the third street promenade where you can find the best stores, a lot of restaurants, street artists and more! the train station and the bus stop are close too! it's definitely the best place to stay next to l.a! the staff are good, the room and the cleaning are also good and i felt safe during my stay! i would definitely stay there again when i come back to l.a!"
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel
Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"a really nice hostel, no complains!  location is great, super close to the beach, nice area in general. only negative aspect was the breakfast, there was not a big range of food. if you’re late, they don’t have any bananas anymore, so be up early! "
Romania,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excelent place 
Argentina,Male,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,muy buen hostel recomendable sólo q fui a una habitación de 10 personas me pareció caro el precio para tantas camas todo el resto excelente 
Germany,Female,41+,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,nice location
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"this hostel is well located in santa monica. it's not central in la, but nearly nothing is central in la... but it's easy to get from/to the airport from there by bus. the hostel is in renovation at the moment. so a lot of parts are really new. they have a big kitchen and a couple of commun areas. breakfast is toast, cornflakes, banana, coffee tea. they also have laundry facilities. i would recommend it."
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel ! after coming from an aweful hostel in fishermans wharf i was so relieved this hostel was so nice ! lovely rooms, loads of space ! the staff were delightful, the location was insane ! the bathrooms were spotless ! perfect , i would certainly reccomened this hostel "
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,7.7,6,10,10,2,10,6,10,"i enjoyed my stay two years ago.this time the hostel is undergoing a floor by floor renovation.unfortunately, my floor (2nd) hasn't been renovated yet. the dorm was extremely hot and uncomfortable (the fan didn't help).the bathroom ventilation system must have been turned off due to the renovations on the third floor. when i stepped out of the shower, i was sweating due to the high humidity. after two days of experiencing this, i went to the fourth floor to shower. it will be very nice in 2018!!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,"i rent a bedroom with one bathroom but this the bathroom was under renovation and i had to use the collective, but i paid for one bedroom with one bathroom inside and private. and when i complained nobody did anything... i'm very sad "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10/10. only thing is parking cost 17.50 a day to park
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,8,6,"needs air conditioning desperately! other than that, really good"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,6,8,"great location, always a wait for showers though -not enough for the floor. overall great place "
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,a little pricey but i enjoyed my stay and the location can't be beat. the staff are great. 
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i really enjoyed my time here at this hostel, so much so i didn't want to leave! it's right near the beach, pier, and tonnes of good bars and food restaurants around. the hostel was clean and had a great area for eating, lounging and a pool table... activities for everyday. would recommend staying here, it's definitely refreshing after spending sometime in la city centre! "
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"been to a lot of hostels, and this is my first review. staff were super friendly and accommodating, remembered my name and were helpful with getting me a locker and storing my luggage when i had to run to work at an event. they pointed me in the direction of everything i needed, area was close to everything though i didn't explore much because i was only there for one night. everything was clean, facilities are open and airy, good wifi. i'd stay again for sure. "
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is awesome. rooms are pretty basic but with a charging port and light by every bed, who can complain? the place was under renovations when i stayed but i was not bothered by this at all. free breakfast every morning which was awesome. fab location, literally 2 minutes from the beach and the boardwalk. felt completely safe walking back at night too."
Ireland,Couple,31-40,4.6,4,6,10,4,4,2,2,"great location, but it took over 30 minutes to check in, then we had to continually change rooms and beds.  then we were overcharged.  having stayed in 100's of hostels around the world, this was probably the most complicated hostel experience ever.    also, what is it with all the plastic that you guys use?  plastic around every slice of bread?  really?  and this beside a sign saying that you are a 'green' hostel?  come on guys, it is 2017.  no more #greenwashing for pr."
England,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"fantastic location, so close to shops, restaurants and beach. staff friendly on arrival. the rooms are very clean and the bathroom especially was so clean and newly fitted. they organise lots of trips/bar crawls etc, so there's always something going on. my only criticism was the breakfast was terrible compared to other hi hostels i've stayed in. brown bananas, cornflakes or bread (each slice in an individual plastic wrapper... thought you were an eco friendly hostel!) apart from that- fab!"
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,10,6,"good atmosphere overall, nice place to meet people and excellent location.    cleanness wasn't too good and the breakfast was below average."
Colombia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,6,10,6,4,"have to pay to use the pc! even for a little search, nothing remarkable on the atmosphere, quiet and not much plans, restrooms a bit messy but not a big deal. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,loved it although rooms are so hot at night  
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"hard to find any fault with this hostel. great location in santa monica, close to metro station to downtown la (downtown is about 45 minutes by metro). lots of great common areas to relax. the top level already has bathrooms renovated, and the noise only occurred from 9am, by which time we were heading out anyway. breakfast is great!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location as it's literally right behind the 3rd street promenade and a 2 minute walk to santa monica pier, friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms! could not have asked for any more"
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"a good, polished, high quality service. however, it was lacking in the warmth of other hi hostels "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"a very clean, well located hostel, the staff were very helpful, especially tori. second time staying and i'll be back again next time i'm in la. "
Philippines,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good location, good staff, free breakfast. comfy rooms and lots of places to hang out inside and outside. my room was at the 2nd flr, got wifi and a bathroom. my friend who stayed at the 4thbflr didn't have both according to what she told me. "
England,Male,18-24,4.6,2,8,8,4,2,6,2,don't normally complain about hostels. but i was there for one night and hated it. dirty. rude staff. over priced. 
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"there are only 2 showers for the whole floor which was problematic and you had to pay to use the onsite computers. there wasn't much of a social atmosphere here, we weren't really told about anything going on at the hostel by the staff and you couldn't drink on the premises so there wasn't any party/fun atmosphere at all like at other hostels.   the room was unbearably hot, there was a fan provided but this was incredibly noisy. the location is excellent for restaurants/bars/beach. "
Sweden,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"my friend and i chose this hostel solely for its location and were not disappointed, walking distance to everything worth seeing in santa monica. they were renovating when we were there and unfortunately the ac didn't work in our room at the time but it wasn't really that big of a deal. i really have no complaints, this is by far the best hostel i've ever stayed at."
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,even though it was under construction it was a great place to stay! very convenient location!
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hotels iv stayed at. new and clean. very accommodating, friendly staff and awesome location to shops and beach. went above and beyond to help me. was able to store my luggage for the whole day after checking out and was even able to have a shower when i returned to collect my bags before my long flight home. "
Australia,Female,18-24,5.7,2,6,10,6,6,6,4,"overpriced for what you get! the only positive is the location. you could stay somewhere much nicer for the same price/only a few dollars more. construction is much more distracting than made out to be, 3 communal showers shared between mutiple girls dorms is no where near enough! the showers are cold and the bedrooms get very hot. very dissapointed for the ammount of money i paid."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,some of the girls that were in my room came in in the middle of the night and were very loud and turning the light on and left it on while they went to go shower. it was difficult to get any sleep. 
Australia,Female,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a fantastic hostel. very big and the new bathrooms are of a hotel standard. the staff are really friendly and the breakfast is very substantial. there's lots of space to chill out, and the neighbourhood is safe to walk around at night."
Finland,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,a good hostel to see santa monica. near the metro rail and an airport bus stop. free breakfast is ok though i don't get why everything is individually wrapped - even slices of bread! a bit far from los angeles' attractions but very near the beach.
England,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel 5 minutes from the beach. rooms were clean but a little dated and top bunks can be a little tricky to get up and down. good breakfast selection, the staff were brilliant and very helpful. 100% would recommend."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms and it was really good. clean, good shared bathroom, comfortable bed and a light and charging point for each bed  amazing location, right near the beach and third street promenade  lift wasn't working as part of renos but no big issue "
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,clean tidy and modern. quite big so not a great atmosphere. good location though. five minutes walk from the beach.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,absolute best place i've stayed in my travels! great facilities and location but the people i met  have become friends i've travelled with across america! beyond happy with service  cheers guys! 
France,Male,18-24,7.7,4,8,10,6,10,8,8,"overall, pretty good (nice location, nice staff). with taxes, i ended up paying 66$ a night for a 10 bedroom ensuite dormitory which i find crazily expensive for what it is though. "
USA,Male,31-40,4.9,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,i was visiting from florida.  my flight got in early and hadn't slept for in 28 hours.   my hotel didn't have rooms available. i booked my reservation 10 minutes before i walked though the door so could sleep for a few hours.  i was told the room wasn't ready and because of the policy i couldn't get my money back. i could understand if i booked this weeks ahead of time.  i was ten minutes before. this is robbery.
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,can't believe it's right next to the pier! love this hostel. 
England,Female,25-30,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,i emailed the hostel to cancel with more than 24 hour s in advance. they told me to contact hostel world to let them know. hostel world then told me to contact the hostel directly. i have now been charged these cancellation fees.    very disappointed 
Mexico,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,8,6,"the hostel is very well located in santa monica (could actually not be better) and is easy to reach. thanks to the comments from the readers i got the tip of parking in the civic center lot, which is way cheaper than the rest of the lots. for this reason i had to walk a little bit from there but it was totally worth it.   the place is fine and should be better after the remodelling (but now its a bit noisy and bathrooms were not too clean). breakfast was fine and i enjoyed my overall stay here"
USA,Male,18-24,5.4,4,8,8,4,6,4,4,"showers were cold and terrible flow. soap dispensers empty in the rooms. beds were terribly uncomfortable. windows had to be open because it was hot and no a/c - cars and motorcycles very loud on the street. would never stay here again (nor would i visit la again, as the people are not friendly anywhere in la area)."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"really good, although i feel i'm old enough and mature enough to be given a choice of temperature for my shower other than cold. "
India,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nice stay in the best location in santa monica.
Scotland,Couple,41+,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,10,6,"appreciated having a private room but was disappointed at the room size/ layout and facilities.  for the price, we could have found a budget hotel with entirely private facilities so on that score this wasn't the best value for money. i understand that the dorm rooms are much cheaper and that for multiple travellers this is good value of course. appreciated the breakfast and use of kitchen facilities. would have liked yoghurt at breakfast and perhaps more choice of fruit but otherwise satisfied."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,8,6,"really enjoyed staying here! such an amazing location for everything around santa monica, easy walking distance to everything. staff were all super friendly and helpful.   only issue was the shower and it not being very hot, or clean. but i did see cleaners in the bathroom daily, so people just didn't keep it clean. rooms and other facilities were great, just a lack of power points for charging things. overall great place and highly recommend staying here."
England,Male,18-24,7.4,8,10,10,6,8,2,8,feels more like a hotel than a hostel. no atmosphere whatsoever but very clean and well managed.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel!!!  every thing was so perfect for me  i loved it !!! amazing staff sooo clean and beautiful !so impressed about the location too close to everything! ❤️😎😉
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,everything is great with the exception of the pool table. if they are going to have a pool table the least they can do is have chalk and a rack that is not taped together. the staff and the location are amazing.
Germany,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,6,8,"generally very good, but due to the size rather hotel atmosphere "

NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"hostel was clean and tidy, good location and staff were all friendly. 3rd floor girls showers were only either scolding hot or freezing which wasn't ideal, but otherwise hostel was good."
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"we enjoyed our stay! the hostel has great lounge areas and security too! location was amazing, 5 min walk to the water. the staff were helpful and friendly as well. i noticed the bathrooms were in need of better ventilation- giving them a smell. otherwise everything was clean and the kitchen was the best i'd seen in a hostel. the hostel wasn't very ecofriendly.. as every single item at break fast was individually wrapped, even a single piece of toast and no composting available. which bothered m"
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,4,8,"quietest hostel i have been in, not much atmosphere but great location "

England,Female,25-30,7.4,10,8,8,8,4,6,8,"i stayed at this hostel for one night and it was great value for money and in a good location for me, the 2 things that i didn't enjoy, the girl in my room, literally glared at me after i said hello, not the hostels fault but i didn't get a good vibe. the guy who checked me in was angry as 'we had all turned up at once' there was 3 or 4 separate bookings that turned up, but he was the only one who seemed angry there was a cue! apart from that, it was clean, safe and great for what i needed!"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,8,10,10,"very nice hostel, with lots of facilities, very clean. location is great, only 5 min from the santa monica beach. highly recommend!"
Italy,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,6,8,"no meaning to pay more for having the toilet in the room, the sink, shower and toilet are all separate and the sink has no door. i was using the shared showers/toilets, much better  "

Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel right in the middle of santa monica the better part of la.  don't stay in venice beach, santa monica is far cleaner, nicer and there's way more to do.  i've stayed at upwards of 100 hostels and this is one of the best.  clean, comfortable, safe and not noisey.

Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i know it's la, but a bit expensive for dorms. a very nice and modern building with a good location though. seemed to have some cool people staying there."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,the staff was very courteous.  the rooms were clean as well as the bathrooms.
Venezuela,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a wonderful stay in the santa monica hostel. the facilities are exceptionally clean.  my few favorites were having proper wifi, a comfortable common space, and having the beach close by."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great kitchen, one street up from santa monica pier, or one street the other way for third street promenade and santa monica place (awesome shopping and dining). friendly staff, nice lounge areas. very happy would highly recommend. "
Scotland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is the second time i have stayed here. there is a great choice of food and drink for breakfast. 1 block away from santa monica pier. very friendly staff. i will be back next time i'm over in california.

USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great hostel and great location. most people staying here were a little standoffish doing their own thing. i did meet a couple friends so it is possible. the events were great hosted by the hostel. i did have one issue where an associate told me the hike was canceled because of rain earlier in the week. when i woke up the next morning the hike was still on. so this left me a little frustrated because i started to make plans for that day. however, i did go on the hike and it was great! "
Belgium,Male,31-40,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,great location and communal spaces. breakfast is limited but fine. main issue was with noise as the room doors make quite a ruckus!
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"staff were very friendly and helpful, had an incident with another traveller in our dorm room which staff dealt with outstandingly. location was good, right next to the beach and a 5 minute walk to the buses into the city. beds were fine but not the comfiest, also the sheets were strangely very loud and rustled. would have been good to have doors in the shower rather than just curtains. wifi was very good. security was reasonable. would recommend. "
Canada,Female,25-30,3.4,2,4,10,2,2,2,2,"save your money! if there is another place to stay, stay there. this hostel has the weirdest vibe. the staff have been poorly trained in routine things such as giving a refund and proper customer service.    the bunk beds need every single screw tightened. i could feel the girl below me every time she moved. the rooms are dirty and stink and the carpets are old! there's no security lock on the bathroom. i would never stay here again and checked out early!! "
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"good hostel, great location in santa monica. santa monica while far nicer is quite far from hollywood though so bare that in mind when booking. "
Switzerland,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,the location is really good and you have 3rd st with all the shops and 5 minutes to the beach.

Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"great hostel, right on santa monica, near all the shops/bars/restaurants and pier. bathrooms were clean, breakfast was good. really huge building, sometimes felt more like a hotel. i've booked a twin room but was given a double bedroom, front desk told me there weren`t any other twin rooms available. the double bedroom was clean, small but functional. very nice stay overall."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"excellent location, helpful staff, good wifi/kitchen/breakfast. absolutely terrible showers though! "
France,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,great hostel to spend some time in santa monica. 
Netherlands,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"what a great hostel. the free breakfast is really good. staff really nice.he location is just perfect on 2e street in santa monica.  save area, main street with  a lot of shop/ restaurant re just a min walk,a lot of good an nice restaurant and bars around the hostel. everything is in walking distance.  just 5 min walk to santa monica pier and beach. metro 5 a 10 min walk. take to blue bus to the lax airport from santa monica for 1,25 dollar ( 45 min busride)  "
Germany,Female,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,"definitely recommended! everything great - outstanding location, beautiful designed common rooms, healthy and plenty breakfast, friendly, funny and helpful staff. beds and cupboards could be modernized, nevertheless comfortable, clean, secure. restrooms, as in almost every hostel i have seen, need to be cleaned up more frequently and interior could be adapted to a travelers needs, e.g. broader shelves. besides that, it is great to have free hairdryers and fresh towels. great value for money!"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"apologies for the late review! (a year later)  upon arrival, i was upgraded to a better room which was perfect and just what i needed (think there was an issue with my booking). great location, everything within walking distance. secure. definitely recommend this hostel and i'll be staying here again next time i am in santa monica :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,10,6,"mattresses were ridiculously uncomfortable, had the worst night of sleep in my entire life on them. also, when i attempted to go to bed at a reasonable time there was excessive noise throughout the hostel, and when i requested for it to be reduced i was shut down. i also noticed a large amount of alcohol being consumed although it is an alcohol-free hostel. "
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,luggage store should be for free
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i always stay here when i come to la. it's clean, has the perfect location, and everyone is friendly. it's not the best hostel for meeting other people, but maybe that's because i've been here at the off travel season. i'll be back for sure though!"
Mexico,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,6,10,10,there was a difference in the treat with us.
Canada,Male,25-30,5.7,6,8,10,6,4,2,4,arrived january 1st. entire place smelled.   no atmosphere.   people and staff were rude.   rooms got extremely hot overnight   power outlet by bed did not work   bathrooms were disgusting and unsanitary 
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great stay(s), attentive (and patient) desk staff-have catered to my many annoying requests gracefully, and are very helpful if given the opportunity (except for that one guy...).    ps-i wish i would've known about the coed dorms sooner. "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've stayed in. plenty of open space, awesome people. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,6,8,8,"nice area,  clean rooms. the only thing i didn't like were the bathrooms. they didn't smell nice and the hooks for your clothes was outside of the shower, which meant anyone could take your things while in the shower. "
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,6,10,8,10,"it was a really great hostel overall, most essentials, nicely furnished, safe. loved how large and equipped the kitchen was. breakfast could be improved. bathrooms overall did the trick. the hairdryers were not strong enough. the rooms were overall pretty good. the window wouldn't close in my room and it was really cold. they did offer extra blankets. it was kind of loud a few nights after 10 pm and i smelled weed in the hallway and really wish they'd strongly enforce the no-smoke/drugs rule. "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've stay here twice, and my latest stay was amazing. i arrived at 12am and the guy on the front desk was so lovely, happy and kind (given the hour). he was so accommodating, changing my room so that i could have a bottom bunk for my last night before flying home. this was probably only possible given the time of year being so close to christmas. brekky is good, cleanliness of facilities is really good as well. great value for money. perfect location &amp; really easy to meet people. will stay again"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"decent hostel in a good location in santa monica. pretty far from downtown but really nice proximity to the beach. very little atmosphere when i was there. struggled with the laundry facilities, not enough machines. "
Belarus,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful place for it's value, just a few minutes of walking from santa monica beach"
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,the breakfast is pretty basic. i would appreciate a little more variety there.
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,10,8,"great place, walking distance to everything!!"
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,8,6,10,staff were great! showers were not so good but apart from that it was awesome
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,stayed for 1 night. the bed i was allocated was taken however i was upgraded once staff were notified. the staff are very friendly and helpful. recommended restaurants and printed my boarding pass. nice clean hostel in good location. 
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"overall great, no bar though which is a great way to meet people"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,maybe a larger variety for breakfast but other than that 10/10.
Latvia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever i have visited! fabulous place to live and it's close to the muscle beach and santa monice pier!!!!  - great breakfast  - clean  - friendly stuff  - comfortable rooms  - great location  - high speed wifi  - great price    just a few factors which made me truly happy!  i'll come again!
USA,Couple,25-30,4.9,2,6,8,4,6,2,6,"this place is clearly trying to maximize the number of people through the door. it's jammed with travelers, but there are so few places to hang out that people can't be comfortable enough to speak to once another. just two couches! also the common areas are cavernous and loud. kitchen was stressful. beds were uncomfortable. it seems like the only folks having fun were the ones going clubbing till 2 am. not my kind of place. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,6,10,"great location, nice and helpful staff. as a solo traveler i just wish they had more organized events or tours to make it easier to meet people. otherwise it was a good hostel with huge lockers and super safe!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"hostel is very high quality in terms of staff, cleanliness, facilities and location.  only drawback i could think of was the atmosphere was like a library! very quiet hostel which wasn't for me. overall great stay if you looking for something quiet, safe, and clean."
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,8,6,6,"i only spent a single night here so i cant really judge the hostel on its atmosphere as i think you need to be somewhere a few days to do so. facility wise it was good and had everything you'd expect. the dorm rooms were fine, bathrooms a good size so there was never a wait for a shower and staff were helpful and friendly. location was good the beach, bars and food options were never far way. personally i wouldn't stay here again but it's my preference rather than a fault with the hostel. "
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,the absolute best location in santa monica - near everything especially the beach ! the hostel is comfortable but not luxury. the beds are cozy with nice pillows. my roommates were quiet and respectful. friendly staff. great group trips. showers are lukewarm which is a bummer. the other huge downside: the breakfast is truly miserable with weird plastic wrapped bread slices and cornflakes as the only option- no fresh fruit. fortunately there is plenty of great food in santa monica ! 
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,8,10,8,"hi santa monica was a fine hostel, the beds were not very comfortable though. "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved this hostel. the location is perfect and is only a 40 minute train trip to downtown la. the staff were lovely and helpful, the rooms and bathrooms clean and the communal spaces big and welcoming. would stay here again and recommend this hostel in a heartbeat."
Brazil,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"the place is great, very well located!"
Netherlands,Female,31-40,6.3,6,8,10,6,4,4,6,"matrasses are terrible and worn down and they keep running out of toilet paper and don t fill up on time. staff are friendly but not outgoing and don t really feel that when you ask them to do something, they do it. for a hi hostel i m quire disappointed. the bedroom i was in was really run down while the downstairs looks great. and there is poor ventilation in room. the first few days the weather was warmer and the room was unbearable even with a fan!"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was really fantastic. it had everything you'd need, chargers/lights by the bed, large lockers, great free breakfast  (although individually packaged slices of bread still bemuse me), lots of nice common areas. really couldn't fault it. one of the best hostels i've stayed at on my travels. it is quite large so bare that in mind, depending on the atmosphere you're after. location in santa mónica also great! would definitely stay at other hi hostels."
Mexico,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great hostel located in the best area of santa monica, parking is expensive right i front of the hostel.  close from the bus station. great atmosphere. i loved the hostel i will totally come back!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've stayed here before. i made sure to stay here this time. i will stay here next time i'm here. excellent all around. only warning is that la is really, really spread out. it takes about an hour on the bus to get to hollywood-ish from santa monica. hour and half to downtown. if your trip is centered on locales other than sm &amp; the beach towns and you didn't rent a car, you may want to stay somewhere closer to your destinations."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,8,10,"only stayed one night. location, cleanliness and security were great! but the rooms are hot! very glad i was there on a reasonably mild day, would hate to stay there in summer! and the beds are not comfortable. good breaki from what i saw and but the biggest plus is location, just a block from santa monica pier and beach"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"nice place to stay when visiting santa monica. right by the beach.   great facilities, place is huge and has lots of common areas. friendly staff.   was only there one night so didn't get to check out the walking tours or social events.   convenient outlets by beds. quiet at night in the rooms.  breakfast is toast, cereal, and fruit. "
Japan,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is the best one i have ever stayed! clean, good location, helpful staff, affordable price. you won't find like this hostel in santa monica.  thank you all staffs."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,2,10,8,2,8,2,6,overpriced . don't go 
India,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the bed was made and very nice breakfast!! just what a lazy girl needs :)    five stars!

Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved everything about this hostel !  im getting older and wasnt to sure about going back to a hostel but this one didnt disappoint.  great location, , clean, beautiful courtyard, lots of place to hang out, and pretty quiet overall."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,2,10,6,8,"2nd level shower drains blocked, caused flooding in showers.   mattresses were uncomfortable.  good 4 bed lockers and good security.   good location."
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,10,8,6,8,6,6,"lack of air con means the rooms can be really, really stifling. also pretty big, so difficult to establish a great atmosphere. on the plus side, staff are great, location is fab and i've not been to a more secure hostel."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best service and best company in my room  had alot of fun and met very interesting people   the best experience   thanks  will be back
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was an amazing place to stay. many more amenities than usually get in a hostel that price, and in a phenomenal location."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a beautiful hostel. i liked everything about this place: nice chill open atmosphere and hangout area, nice enough dorm, above average breakfast. there was a staff member who was kind of rude and seemed very annoyed to have to talk to me. other than that the limo bar night was bananas. the location right next to the santa monica boardwalk is perfect but i should note it is quite far from downtown los angeles and public transit in la is laughably bad."
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,4,10,10,"i stayed two nights and i totally recommend it, i made a great deal! the only thing i didn't like was the attitude of one of its team members.  on thursday 13th i went to get the breakfast to the kitchen/cafeteria area around 8am. and the person on charge that day was so rude. he's like 50 years old, hispanic.     after that,  the location is great, price, i'll be back soon!! the front people are very helpful    eduardo g"
Germany,Male,18-24,6.6,8,8,10,6,6,6,2,"a big hostel that feels more like a hotel. reminded me of places we stayed during schooltrips. in fact a big group from denmark checked in the same day. in generall check in took a long time, but was relatively easy.   watch out for sunday's!!! on sundays there is a free pub-crawl and half my roommates came in super late, drunk as hell, falling all over the place and looked themselves out multiple times. in addition to that they puked all over the room and beds... smelled terrible! no good sleep"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"great location right in the heart of santa monica. the free breakfast was enough to fill you up with toast, cereal and juice. only problem would be cleanliness of the shared bathroom, by the evening it was very messy/dirty also in our room only one of 4 power plugs worked. otherwise everything was great! i would definitely stay here again."
Argentina,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great hostel! one of those you could easily spend many days at, and feel comfortable. great rooms, with big lockers. nice breakfast. perfectly located in santa monica. "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"excellent hostel. was disappointed because we were only staying in la for one day! fantastic location, right next to the pier and santa monica beach, as well as the promenade with amazing shops and places to eat. only a short walk away from bus stop to airport. great bedrooms and common areas to relax or meet people. would stay again!!"
NewZealand,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,a great hostel and a great place to stay right in the middle of santa monica. 
England,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"overall all fine for a hostel in a central location. great pub crawl, communal areas modern, breakfast good hostel standard. only area which could do with some attention was bathrooms which were a bit dated and a couple of showers not working. overall would recommend.

Spain,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel, amazing staff, wonderful location. highly recommended!"
CzechRepublic,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"cool, good looking hostel in great area, close to the beach, close to shopping area, nice, friendly staff, laundry is cheap… all cool. but here is no a/c in the rooms, just fan, so is still warm and a bit noisy, what's not the best for sleeping. anyway good place to stay and i will like to stay again. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,10,10,2,10,"amazing location! quite far away from touristy stuff in actual la but if you just want the beach/santa monica pier/venice beach then it's fantastic!! big rooms, decent bathrooms. loads of shops and very close to all public transport. absolutely zero atmosphere though - do not expect any socialisation at all which is a real shame... doesn't really feel like a hostel, more like a hotel in terms of atmosphere."
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,4,10,10,10,overall a good and cheap place to stay in the heart of everything. location not the best if you have a car expensive parking. most facilities are great but it was hot and to sleep in a hot like oven dorm with 7 other guys and no ac that was terrible.
Bulgaria,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,no restroom in the room
Croatia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,everything was great .would reccomend to staying  there 4sure ;)
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,"good hostel, incredible location, friendly staff, tidy. the only negative thing i could say is that they do not have the airport shuttle as advertised, they do however have a deal with a taxi compnay that is a 25 dollar flat rate to lax plus the $5 airport fee . "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,great hostel. awesome breakfast. massive lockers. dazzling tv room. great staff. although beds could be a little bigger...other then that i would recommend this hostel to any sort of traveler.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel.  friendly staff, great facilities.  a short walk from santa monica pier and a 20min bike ride from venice beach.  very clean and nice rooms.  only downfall is there is no air conditioning."
Canada,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,4,10,8,4,"check in was fast and efficient. staff were extremely accommodating and polite. excellent location right next to the beach and pier.  bed frames were made of wood and really noisy if you shifted while using them. mattresses were a bit on the thin side.  i stayed in a co-ed room one night which was lovely and a males only room the second time i went - males room was somewhat messy and the light in the ensuite shower was dim, making it hard to see.  overall decent experience."
Scotland,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"good location, good facilities. room was really noisy, loudest hostel room i have stayed in so far. "
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"pros: location is just perfect, crawling distance from the beach and pier. a walk along the beach to venice is wonderful. lots of places to eat around and very close to public transport from lax. plenty of activities to do with fellow travelers, like pub crawls or movie nights. big lockers are provided, easily fits a big backpack. building is really nice, lots of places to chill. dorm had its own bathroom.  cons: the dorms were a bit of a let down quality-wise, very squeaky and narrow beds. "
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,8,8,4,6,"great location and the common facilities were nice, however, the dorm itself was quite unpleasant. it was noisy throughout the night, very stuffy and the only fan was incredibly loud and difficult to sleep through. not the best hostel for meeting people either but the location is a real bonus.

England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,10,6,8,"really good hostel! i came to ask if i could store my backpack and the guy was able to check me in early. plenty of showers and toilets, enough space in the rooms and all bunks have a plug socket and lamp which is a really nice feature.a stones throw from santa monica pier and walking distance to venice beach which is amazing. also me and 2 other girls got dropped back from our tour 2 hours early at 4.30am and there was a nice lady on reception who let us sit in the lobby for as long as we liked"
England,Female,25-30,8.3,4,10,10,8,10,8,8,"i stayed in the middle of sept for a week and overall it was a good stay. there are lockers in every room and entry to the hostel is keycard only. location is great - 2 mins from the beach, and santa monica is all walkable - but if you want to explore the rest of la the buses take about an hour to get to downtown/hollywood. there are plenty of social spaces and activities almost every day. but it is expensive and if you want to use the luggage storage after checkout you have to pay $5 after 1pm."
Denmark,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,very nice place. however quite large place which make it more difficult to meet people. i was staying on 4th floor and the wifi connection was really bad!
Israel,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel is in a graet location, he is big and very clean. the breakfast is nice and the atmosphere is cool"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,highly recommend. staff awesome. 
Israel,Male,25-30,3.1,2,4,6,2,2,2,4,"first of all. they charge more that it says on the hostel world website. i bought a $43 dormitory and payed $5 in advance on the website. but when i got there the desk girl sayd i need to add additional $3 for &amp;#34;you don&amp;#39;t have a membership in hotel international&amp;#34; (wtf) + $5 for &amp;#34;hostel tax fee&amp;#34;. when i buy a $43 bed i don&amp;#39;t expect to pay additional $8. its just steeling my money.   on top of that , they don&amp;#39;t allow to be in the shared area after 22:00 and the lockers has no locks."
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,8,6,"the overall experience was good, great location, security was high with key only access and lockers (take your own lock).  however, the shower wasn&amp;#39;t very clean and the breakfast was very. toast, one type of cereal and orange juice no variety."
England,Male,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff were super polite and mega helpful. really close to the beach and shopping district and shuttle to lax also real close. the facilities in the hostel were nice although i felt it was pricey
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,10,10,8,8,6,8,"good hostel! large rooms if you&amp;#39;re staying in a room of 4. need better cooling units though. the room got very hot and a single fan isn&amp;#39;t going to cool anything! having said that, organised events and decent breakfast included. great location only a 3 minute walk to the beach! "
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,10,8,8,10,"hostel was great. it is right in the heart of the shopping precinct and super close to the pier. someone handed flyers for a free comedy show on the second night i stayed. power points were next to every bed in my room! breakfast was basic but free, i went to the juice shop about 3 doors down. i'd definitely stay again."
Slovenia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very good breakfast, great atmosphere, perfect location. very clean, but not enough showers. "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"nice clean hostel! great location! rooms themselves are simple- just bunk beds and a couple mirrors. all you need! right by the pier, so many shopping and food options."
China,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"the entrance looks a bit shady and disappointed me at the very beginning. but they really have everything! there is even a free pool table to play! kitchen is very big surely you can cook whatever you want. i love the countyard!   room is good. shared toilets are not bad, only that hair dryers work not very well. nothing to complain.  i don&amp;#39;t think you can find a better place to stay within this budget!"
England,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"the hostel is one of the nicest i&amp;#39;ve come across. it doesn&amp;#39;t offer the best choice from breakfast when compared to the hi hostel in chicago but still, it&amp;#39;s nice. the rooms are clean and if you ask you can get a towel to use. the lockers are secure and on checking out you can leave your bags in a secure room until 2pm. laundry facilities are great with both washing machines and dryers. there is a lovely lounge and courtyard area. on the 2nd floor there is use of computers and a printer."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,the staff is great! there is a lady staff on midnight shift always being helpful when she heard im sick! nice breakfast! everything is nice! definitely coming back!
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,10,10,6,10,"by far one if the nicest hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in ! clean rooms and bathrooms, a nice outdoor common area, and helpful, friendly staff. a bit expensive but that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to get for santa monica. awesome location though! maybe not the best hostel for solo traveling and meeting new people, but all in all i would definitely stay here again next time i come to la. "
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,great modern hostel. rooms cleaned daily and a well equipped kitchen if you feel like cooking. breakfast provided and plenty of space to hang out after a long day exploring.
Israel,Male,25-30,6.3,6,2,10,6,4,6,10,someone still from me something and the rexeption stuff didnt help much
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"i stayed for three nights, travelling on my own. was happy overall with my stay, the location is great!! i stayed in an 8 bed dorm and everything was clean and tidy. the shared bathroom was fine, and the lockers are really generous. the breakfast included was decent with toast cereal juice and fruit, the staff were also super friendly and helpful. i would stay here again if i was going back to santa monica. "
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.6,4,10,10,6,2,6,8,"amazing location! however thats probably the only thing i liked about the hostel. our 8 bed female dorm didn&amp;#39;t have any air conditioning and being on the 4th floor it was unbearably hot at night, when we spoke to reception to try and find a solution to the problem they said &amp;#39;what do you exect from an economy room.&amp;#39; even though we were paying $55 a night; the most expensive our of the hostels i have stayed in. the communial facilities and breakfast was nice but the rooms were poor value for money"
England,Female,18-24,3.7,2,6,10,2,2,2,2,"wouldn&amp;#39;t stay here again. whilst it is a perfect location, very close to shops and entertainment, the rooms themselves are very poor for what you pay. no air con in economy rooms, instead extremely noisy fans which don&amp;#39;t cool the room, had the worst sleep ever as too warm and noisy. staff very rude and unwilling to help situation, staff ruined the experience. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"staff were absolutely amazing! unfortunately the wifi was quite slow and would sometimes time out and become unusable.    good decent sized rooms that were very spacious.    the bathrooms were a little awkward with only a shower curtain to separate yourself from everyone else walking past.    overall it&amp;#39;s a pretty decent hostel, location is amazing!"
NewZealand,Male,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,all the staff were friendly and went out of their way to help. happy to stay there again.cheers
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,the parking situation is great! the building straight across the road does overnight at 17.50us. only thing would be the lack of air con or if there was aircon in the main areas it definitely wasn&amp;#39;t set to cold. would have been perfect if it had been winter!
Australia,Female,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel, great staff, awesome facilities. loved every moment and the breakfast set up was fantastic."
Singapore,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great location; the security is quite tight i.e. before check-in/after check-out there was no way to access dining area whereas reception area is spartan with no comfy waiting area; room and bath facilities are average (one of the shower stall was not working, fan in room was not working); staff are helpful except they are also always busy so waiting times can get long."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever!
USA,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,plugs in the room don&amp;#39;t work
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,really great place. looked good and stayed clean. only cons were the outlets above the beds all really sucked and mine didnt even work and there was no alcohol allowed on the premises which took away from the atmosphere. 
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel as most hi are! great location only a 2 min walk from the pier and 3rd street promenade! rooms were clean, bathrooms were clean. breakfast in the morning was great. lots of activities provided by the hostel. only thing i would say is the beds weren&amp;#39;t the comfiest i&amp;#39;ve ever stayed in but also not the worst. i would stay here again and recommend to friends "
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,4,"hostel itsel is very nice, the rooms are nice too. just the bahrooms are dirty and not really enjoyable. otherwise the hostel was fine and the location is amazing, it&amp;#39;s one block form the beach!!!"
England,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,10,6,nice place... occasionally went to toliet and wasn&amp;#39;t very clean from last person... this could be improved!! showers should get a clean a little more often than once a day due to the amount of people using them.. overall lovely place good size nice breakfast 😃
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel in a superb location extremely close to the beach and surrounded by santa monica&amp;#39;s shops, restaurants and bars. bevin&amp;#39;s tour of venice was really fun as well!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location but atmosphere seemed to be lacking. 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"first hostel i stayed in la and absolutely loved it. got the recommendation of staying in santa monica from friends, so this is the perfect location. so close to the beach, and easy bike ride down to the venice or train to downtown. facilities are basic, but decent sized wardrobe for a locker which was great. rooms are a little hot but fan is pretty good. pub crawl was great... had so much fun! brekky basic cereal and toast but good anyway. wifi is excellent!! would definitely stay here again. "
France,Male,25-30,7.1,4,10,10,6,8,4,8,great great location in santa monica. quite amazing in such expensive place. the big issue is the room. aweful and noisy fan! i could not sleep until one guy finally stopped it! but of course it was hot like hell after that... a pity because the location and the patio could have made this place fantastic
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"this location is amazing! it is two blocks from the beach, super nice mall, the pier, and healthy restaurants. the lockers here are also amazing, biggest ones i have ever seen. they are basically as big as my closest at home. my friend way overpacked and brought a hugeeee suitcase but the whole thing fit in one side of the locker. it was awesome! also, there is tons of parking structures (one right across the street). only downside: beware of homeless they are everywhere. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,10,6,8,8,amazing location for santa monica! staff were helpfull and the dorm rooms were very spacious  
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,amazing locations and staff are very helpful. but sadly it&amp;#39;s let down by the restrooms. 3 toilets and only one door closes. and showers no where to put ur clothes but out on be common area. not very practical. 
England,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,8,6,6,8,well located and appointed hostel. great location in central santa monica most importantly. good breakfast included. friendly atmosphere.  
England,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,the location is excellent. the dorms are a little small and basic but there&amp;#39;s enough room to put your stuff and a plug socket above each bed. good showers. my dorm was very hot (there was a heatwave and just one fan that didn&amp;#39;t move). breakfast wasn&amp;#39;t great - individually wrapped slices of bread?? so i just grabbed a coffee and went elsewhere to eat. the organised bar crawl was fun and a good way to meet other travellers and locals. i would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,great location! good vibes. would definitely stay here again 
Canada,Male,31-40,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,4,8,close to beach was convenient if you plan to swim in the ocean like i do.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,8,8,10,"this place is a great hostel to meet people, with a pretty good pub crawl. unfortunately the breakfast isn&amp;#39;t very good and the hostel overall is very expensive for what it offers. "
Australia,Female,25-30,6.3,8,2,10,4,8,4,8,"myself and some other guests had trouble with a really aggressive guest in our room who we, and hostel staff suspected was on drugs. i thought being an alcohol/ drug free hostel she would be removed, however she wasn&amp;#39;t and after abusing me she was able to not only stay, but in the same room. this really upset me. a bad end to an otherwise lovely hostel. "
Germany,Female,18-24,6.9,8,4,8,8,6,8,6,"towels had yellow spots and black hair on them (not my hair), same on the blanket (black hair) had a crazy woman in 8person room with weed i guess (strong smell in the room for a while) we (friend&amp;i) told the staff but nobody did anything. the woman cursed us out that we were too loud &amp; i was moving &amp; talking while i was asleep in the night (as if i could change it) so she got very upset &amp; yelled at us. the staff said they would send people to check on woman &amp; stuff! nothing happened. thumbs up"
Australia,Female,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,8,8,6,6,"hostel itself was average, but location was excellent and the hostel had a nice outdoors area. the breakfast layout included slices of bread that were individually wrapped in plastic - one slice of bread per plastic wrapping - obviously not very environmentally responsible. overall, an enjoyable stay."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very nice, a little expensive but guess are paying for location "
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was absolutely fantastic!..so well done and i will definately be back!..the location is flawless as well!..one happy traveller..thankyou
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i visit la every other month, but i usually stay in west hollywood with a friend... i decided to change things up and stay in a hostel! i've stayed abroad in hostels and have always had a great time... this was no exception! connected with people right away and made some friends for life. security is good and location is great... rooms can be hot in the summer but it's cali so just wear less. i missed morning meal usually bc i slept in... but when i did make it down, i got my fill. stay here!"
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"hostel was in a great location. only bad thing was the amount of waste the hostel produced. at breakfast they gave out individually wrapped slices of bread, plastic butter and jelly containers, plastic containers of corn flakes portions, plastic bottles of orange juice and mini cartons of milk. would expect a hostel to be more environmentally aware."
Sweden,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"nice and clean but old, the bunk bends could be categorized as antique. no ac. "
England,Female,18-24,4.3,4,6,10,2,2,2,4,"the location of the hostel is great, however that is the only good thing about it. staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. there were little to no facilities per floor. one night the power was shut off, very little notice was given. fan in room broken and was unbearably hot. very disappointed with the hostel, not value for money. slept very poorly during my stay due to the unbearable heat in the room. would not recommend !! "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place and great location. lots of friendly staff and guests. 
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the facility is clean and provides a wonderful atmosphere with lots of space to relax. it is close to the shops and beach. also a very secure space with affordable pricing. thanks.
Lithuania,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"exceptional! no complaints. amazing hostel: very clean, modern, spacious, helpful staff and next to the beach as well as the third street promenade. they also give bike rental special deals that save you some money. "
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location for santa monica and venice beach and shopping/restaurants etc. easy access to hollywood also. really spacious rooms and great facilities. friendly staff and other people staying at the hostel. the only thing i thought was odd was the individually wrapped slices of bread at breakfast, coming from an environmental view! just a thought, otherwise loved it! "
Australia,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,one of the best socially prone hostels around. and alot of activities in a top location
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is an excellent hostel. great location and feels very safe and secure. the staff were fantastic and really good at providing public transport directions! beds are comfortable, rooms are clean and the bathrooms are decent. highly recommend!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"a great, clean hostel, comfortable beds, and friendly staff. only down side is no drinking or no bar in the hostel, which made it a little harder to meet people and kick off epic nights however the location of the hostel is next to some excellent bars and clubs so it was pretty easy.     would definitely reccomend and would stay here again. "
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the hostel was clean, affordable and located in a central part of santa monica. it was exactly what you expect, not overly nice but definitely acceptable as a place to crash and hang out between activities."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,10,4,8,10,"this was one of my favourite hostels throughout my usa trip. awesome facilities, clean, good rooms and perfect location. the staff really let this place down - they're reluctant to be helpful and seemed so uninterested in their jobs. i felt like everything was a huge effort for them. apart from that, i would recommend staying here."
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"nice hostel in a good location. the staff could be friendlier and perhaps explain things about the hostel rather than just hand you a sheet and say your room number is on there. leaving you to figure out what floor and where it is.  the breakfast in the morning is a bit lacking. each slice of bread is individually sealed in plastic which is just wasteful, the apples are prepackaged slices rather than just having apples left out which again is very wasteful. otherwise no complaints."
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great stay and lovely staff. it was almost like a hotel, everything was brand new! definitely get what you pay for!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,10,6,6,10,"solid hostel right in the heart of santa monica, not much of a social hostel if you're looking to party this isn't for you."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,10,8,8,8,"great hostel a little bit expensive but has everything you could need, staff friendly and helpful."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to spend a night...met some brazilian fellows who were traveling california &amp; had lots of interesting stories to share..i felt very comfortable with them &amp; slept very well...the location is perfect...close to everything. ..pareked at the civic center &amp; was at the getty villa in 15 minutes. .even with traffic. ..was in downtown la in 20...the great location of the hostel really made my visit very easy, hassle free, &amp; enjoyable....recommend highly.."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"24hr desk, central, good facilities. only complaint is the bathrooms are a bit basic but they are spotless."

USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"great atmosphere, convenient location and i felt very safe staying here! "
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best location, easy to meet people, kitchen set up is amazing! don't worry about the no alcohol rule, if you're subtle about it you're sweet.  don't bother with club tour it's very average. go to bungalow bar!   "
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel!! right by the beach and the shops. very big, lots of space and many rooms so great atmosphere. had a lovely stay!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,a hostel in a fantastic location to access santa monica as well as venice beach. the travel store next door made booking activities so easy and there is a cheap shuttle to the airport at the end of the street. the bathrooms were the only thing i would say were average as they weren&amp;#39;t always that clean. otherwise this place is great!
England,Female,18-24,6.6,4,8,8,6,8,4,8,very expensive but good location and its very clean and organised which is nice!
France,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"had a great stay at this hostel, the only problem was the showers: the one in our room was boiling hot (no way to change the temperature), and the one from the restrooms in the hallway was not great either. i could take a shower but the water was still really hot. i hope they will fix this issue, aside from that, i'm really glad i stayed here!"
Australia,Male,18-24,4.9,4,2,10,6,2,2,8,"great location, but that&amp;#39;s where the positives end. our group of australian guys in our 20s have hostel hopped around the world and know what makes a good hostel experience. the atmosphere is the key. there was a complete alcohol ban which should be clearly disclosed prior to booking! lastly, someone needs to tell the staff to smile once in a while and the maids to stop barging into our rooms without our permission. not to mention stealing our belongings. "
Poland,Female,31-40,8,6,10,10,8,6,8,8,as a single female traveler i was mostly concerned about my safety. it&amp;#39;s a safe place just 2 blocks from the beach.   pluses - it&amp;#39;s clean safe there is a wifi and a complimentary breakfast.    minuses - they could organize more attractions in the evening. pub  crawl is good one  the stuff is ok but not super welcoming.  plus depends who do u have in the room my roommate has been snoring too much so you need to have earplugs  overall very good experience plus i recommend it 
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay here.  the pub crawl was a nice free extra.  i don&amp;#39;t give out many perfect 10&amp;#39;s, but this place earned it.  i&amp;#39;ll be back!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,4,10,10,6,"this hostel is located in the perfect spot. it is a block from the beach/peir and a block from the train station that can take you any where from disneyland to hollywood to universal studios. the staff is so friendly and helpful. the kind of people that stay there that i came across were so friendly, nice and all so culturally different! definitely would stay again! "
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"clean place with lockers and bathrooms in the dorm rooms. also had extra showers on each floor. nice free breakfast that includes milk and juice with food. great location, but they don&amp;#39;t allow alcohol inside (got to keep it discreet or drink out front). easy walk to pier, beach, and bars/restaurants. the hostel also organizes activities. the new rail station to downtown is only a few blocks and a bikeshare station is in front of the hostel. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the best hostel location in la!    it&amp;#39;s five minutes from the beach in beautiful downtown santa monica. they have an amazing friday night club crawl and the facility was top notch. far from hollywood, so be prepared for a long car ride if you&amp;#39;re trying to go party. my friend and i had to agree, this was the best hostel we&amp;#39;ve ever been to."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,great location! 
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"my stay at the santa monica hostel was very nice and the facility was clean and comfortable. the location is great only few blocks from the beach and only a block off the prominade. there is a bike rental stand directly across the street from the hostel which is very convenient. the staff was professional and courteous. best of all i met some friends from other coutries that are simply wonderful.    thank you,  bob"
England,Male,18-24,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,2,"hugely docking marks for having individually wrapped slices of bread (??) at breakfast with no recycling for the packaging. direct to l.a landfill. awful and outdated. sort it out.     this hostel is in the idyllic part of santa monica. l.a can be a bit dodgy, but this hostel is in a nice secure location about three minutes from the beautiful beach and santa monica pier. attentive staff, perfectly pleasant and professional. showers were not worth the money spent.  cold. no temperature control."
Switzerland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"the hostsl is clean and in a good location. the only thing we dindn&amp;#39;t liked was that the showers were not really adjustable and were sometimes cold and hot even you haven&amp;#39;t done something! and all of these, we tried the showers on differenz flors! and the hostel staff told us the wrong bus number to the airport!!! but the rest was really good!"
Taiwan,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,8,8,the facility there is really really good! 
Lithuania,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,10,8,6,6,"really goid pkaces, stuff could be more willing to support sightseeing geeks andmost of all these uncleand showers and restrooms. also my roommates were not friendly and didn&amp;#39;t want to chat."
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,6,8,6,6,"it&amp;#39;s a fine place to stay, especially for the area. i thought the rooms were kind of bad, because the beds were small. i&amp;#39;ve had hostels in asia with longer beds (i&amp;#39;m only 6 feet tall). i also don&amp;#39;t like the atmosphere, boring."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"superb hostel! beds are really comfortable, the beach is one block away, one block away from third st. organised a great pub crawl.   only bad thing is that the water temperature in some of the showers fluctuates slightly. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,good but pricey. like everything in la also no drinking in the hostel results in no atmosphere. but you can just drink in your room if you get good roommates.
Poland,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"i stayed an entire week in hi santa monica.the hostel is in perfect location,one street away from 3rd st promenade and one street away from the beach.the hostel itself provides everything you need-rooms are ok,clean every day,lockers are pretty big,regular carry-on fits in,you just need to get your lock.thumbs up for the light and power socket above every bed.bathrooms and showers are clean,good lightning in there too.everyday breakfast,24/7 kitchen access,outdoor patio and couches to chill."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome experience for santa monica! my friends that live there were blown away 
Finland,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"a huge building - reminds me of a hospital with long hallways with an endless number of rooms. staff is only available at the reception, they don't hang out elsewhere. common rooms to hang out in, tv didn't work. location is excellent right in downtown santa monica close to all shops and restaurants. as an area very nice and safe."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a very nice hostel in a perfect location, right near the beach in santa monica."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,place is chill.  beverly hills adjacent and all that goes with it near the ocean.  it&amp;#39;s why everyone wants to live in california.    dp
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"fairly comfortable. so close to everything i wanted to do in california. the breakfast left much to be desired, but other than that i can&amp;#39;t think of much i would change."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,the hostel is very good. the only problem is that it has so many common areas that there is less socialising than in other hostels with one common area.
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,4,10,10,6,10,6,8,for me the best part of a hostel experience is meeting other travellers.  this hostel (while clean and conveniently located) does not really facilitate the kind of interaction that i was hoping for with other travellers.  i had just come from banana bungalow on hollywood boulevard where i meet loads of people and had a really great time and i actually regret not staying there and visiting santa monica for a day.  santa monica generally lacks character and doesn&amp;#39;t need more than a day trip...
England,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant location on 2nd street. friendly, helpful staff and lots of great facilities including a decent free breakfast. four bed dorms have a double wardrobe each for a locker! spotless kitchen and we'll organised (and clean) fridges. very clean bathrooms - my only gripe was that the showers were cold and that appeared to be normal."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"solid hostel, good location in santa monica, convenient to shopping and the pier and near bus routes to airport or downtown. had fun on the pub crawl and there were some other activities that looked fun as well."
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,10,8,great area!
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is in a perfect location and is incredibly cheap for what you get. the facilities are great, breakfast is nice and we were even lucky enough to stay on a night of the pub crawl which was great fun. i would definitely go back to stay here in the future."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"showers on 4th floor were scorching hot. actual skin burn type temperature. everyone else in my room experienced same thing. i went just after peak bathroom time once and it was still ridiculously hot. when i spoke to front desk, i got a pretty sassy response of &amp;#39;go to level 3&amp;#39;. i&amp;#39;m not really keen on running around a hostel trying to find a good shower... not good enough for how much we pay! "
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,santa monica is a really lovely part of la - much nicer than downtown so this was a great choice for accomodation. breadfast was good and the dorm rooms weren&amp;#39;t too crampt. communal showers weren&amp;#39;t too private but otherwise great hostel.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff were helpful. in a prime location. good if you want a quiet break
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"they gave me an early check-in, which was a god send after flying from australia! super chilled atmosphere and unbeatable location! "
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,i would definitely stay here again or recommend to a friend. 
NewZealand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i cannot think of anything bad about this place. maybe the rooms are a bit too large? maybe the kitchen a bit too nice? the only real downside was its distance from the closest supermarket so you&amp;#39;re kind of forced to go all in or not at all.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,loved my stay here. rooms were spacious and i love that every bunk has a personal lamp and outlet. lockers are big. breakfast is continental but generous. the hostel is always organising tours/outings too which is great to meet the other travellers 
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really nice place, well located right next to the beach. good facilities. "
England,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"really friendly staff. free breakfast of cornflakes, coffee, bread/toast with butter/jam, apple and an unopened bottle of orange juice. i&amp;#39;d take my oj away and drink it later continuously topping it up from the water fountains all other the place. free orange juice all day, admittedly getting weaker!  marked down for: facilities - iron but no ironing board! security - homeless people would come into lobby &amp; outside areas and try to mix with guests, however security cameras are everywhere."
AmericanSamoa,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"it was really worth the cost, the only thing that was annoying was the construction noise, but it was very min. "
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location. right near places to shop and very close to the pier. easy to find from lax. would stay again if i were to return to santa monica. 
SouthAfrica,Female,25-30,8.6,10,4,10,10,8,8,10,"i loved the location and the hostel, for the price there should be more variety at breakfast. a huge bummer for my friend an i was when we got to our room on the second night, someone was in my friends bed and had broken the lock on her locker. we were lucky nothing was stolen but i found that to be unacceptable. staff members did reassign to another room for the night, we were thankful for that."
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing place! gracious staff &amp; the planned events are awesome!
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved my stay here! from the comedy show, to the discounted bike rental, there was plenty to do at a great deal, and the location couldn&amp;#39;t be any better!"
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,the location is awesome! everything was fine.   except that we booked 2 beds in a 10bed female dorm and we had the choices to get separated or sleep in a men&amp;#39;s dorm (but then together). since one of us was underage we couldn&amp;#39;t be seperated. we had to take the men&amp;#39;s dorm. next time i would prefer to get what i booked. but we were to tired to argue when we arrived.
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"perfect location, only two blocks from the beach and in the centre of shops and restaurants.     room was good, if not a little hot. there is a fan but it didn&amp;#39;t really cool the room down much.     i found that it wasn&amp;#39;t a very social hostel but has a nice seating area downstairs.     shared bathrooms are adequate and have hair dryers but the water is either too hot or too cold depending on how many other people are showering, and you can&amp;#39;t change this. "
England,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"never stayed at a hostel until this trip to the usa and this was my second and was extremly good. very clean, great location in the city and seemed very secure, i would highly recommend it for anyone of any age to stay in."
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great location-right in the heart of santa monica and just in between 3rd street promenade and the beach. lovely and clean all round, however a slim choice for breakfast was a bit of a let down."
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,10,6,6,8,"overall, i enjoyed my stay.  the facilities themselves were impressive. loved the location and its proximity to shopping and the beach.  the only drawback was the front desk staff. they were cold for the most part and absolutely expressionless.  i even greeted them with a smile and tried to initiate a friendly interaction but they really didn&amp;#39;t reciprocate (the graveyard lady seemed nice though. being warm with guests can greatly impact there impression of a place. that was my only negative."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i made so many friends, such a cool atmosphere in an amazing location. loved it"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,6,8,8,10,8,"good hostel, easily accessible from airport on public transport. on santa monica beach which isn't the nicest beach in la and a good 40 min drive, 1-5hr bus from hollywood or staples centre. great security with key cards and good basic breakfast in the morning. "
Argentina,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a great stay and the staff is great!... right in the middle of the action in santa monica. easy to get to beverly hills or hollywood. 
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"hi los angeles in santa monica was superb! travelers there ranged in ages and were all very friendly. as far as accommodations, the beds were comfy enough - especially for a hostel. the in-room lockers for your belongings were very large and i was able to fit a carryon suitcase as well as a purse and laptop bag. don&amp;#39;t forget your locks, but if you do they sell them at the counter for $5 usd. the location is amazing. tons of bars and restaurants nearby. i would definitely stay there again!!"
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"besides majority of the hostel being renovated or closed, i had a good stay at this hostel. great location but price could&amp;#39;ve been better. i&amp;#39;m also glad they offered breakfast. simple, yet just what one needs to start their day, "
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, gutted i had awful weather cos it was perfect for the beach and 3rd street promenade!"
England,Male,18-24,5.7,2,8,10,6,4,4,6,"great location, clean enough, blisteringly hot showers, wifi drops in and out, not particularly social, staff don&amp;#39;t know the bus routes. good overall but just extortionately expensive for what you get in my opinion. "
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,10,10,2,8,4,6,construction was going on at the time so all of the facilities were closed. the bathrooms were mostly out of order as well.
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"a ton of people staying here including, what appeared to be, a kids soccer team. there were many children here which i found strange for a hostel. other than that, they had some organized events which were ok. staff was very nice and helpful"
SouthAfrica,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,4,10,very well positioned near the beach and in a lovely area. didn't seem very easy to meet people as the common areas were quite quiet and there was not much encouragement to participate in activities. but all round great place to stay to enjoy santa monica with clean comfy and safe facilities. would recommend  
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,10,6,6,6,10,"no booze allowed  broken pool table no privacy in rooms   liked the separate shower, toilet sink area  liked the outside court yard loved the location  loved the pub crawl  huge kitchen "
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,6,10,8,4,"hmm, this was the second time around i stayed here. the first time- i loved it, great location, great atmosphere, good facilities. unfortunately this time somehow i woke up with a tick on my leg. it wasn&amp;#39;t the greatest surprise to have:/"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,amazing hostel. i met some awesome people here in the social area and they organized some awesome activities and events for us. the hostel itself was beautiful and very clean. there was construction happening but it didn't affect my stay at all. also exactly central to all things touristy in santa monica and an easy walk or bike ride to venice 
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay. the location is ideal for santa monica beach and also easy to rent a bike if u want to cycle on down to venice beach. also the hostel is right beside the shopping area. great place, would stay again."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, only 1 block to the beach. they have activities on if your travelling alone so it&amp;#39;s easy to meet people and just an overall good place to stay :) "
Hungary,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,6,8,4,10,"the hostel in nice and clean.  not a typical party hostel, not much socializing, but they have pub crawls, etc."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,4,10,10,6,8,2,6,relatively clean and well placed hostel. complete lack of atmosphere and no alcohol allowed at all.
Australia,Female,31-40,7.7,6,10,8,10,8,4,8,"this place is huge and pretty basic - so it&amp;#39;s a bit on the pricey side for what you get - there are nicer, cheaper hostels in la tbh. it&amp;#39;s kind of a barn, a bit impersonal, and the bathrooms, though cleaned regularly, were a little yucky - mostly because a lot of the clientele seemed to be very young and not all that adept at cleaning up after themselves. still, it&amp;#39;s in a good location, very safe, warm, convenient etc."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"didn&amp;#39;t get to stay long, but staff were friendly and helpful. the bathrooms were a little dirty, but i did arrive at 11pm. the location was ideal for exploring the area.  easy, cheap shuttle from lax to get you to the hostel. and a direct bus 2mins walk away straight down to union station."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,great hostel in great location. good facilities. not a party place.
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"overall i was very happy with hi santa monica! the location was great, the room was huge, the showers were clean and hot and the beds were quite comfortable. what more do you need! the wifi was a little on the slow and unreliable side and for some reason the hostel was very quiet when i was there so the vibe wasn&amp;#39;t as social as i was expecting but otherwise it was great and i&amp;#39;d recommend it to anyone travelling to santa monica."
Germany,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,6,6,6,8,"a typical hi hostel. amazing location, very basic rooms with lockers, simple breakfast (bread, jam, cereals, tea/coffee, orange juice), bathrooms are a bit older but mostly clean, washing machines were defect. free wifi worked well most of the times, but from time to time got pretty slow. all in all it was a good stay. if you're more interested in a great location rather than fancy rooms, than this is the place to stay.  fyi, wait for shuttle bus from lax is about 30 to 40 minutes."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"great hostel 2 blocks from the beach, very clean with key code access for security. girls at the front desk were great and printed our boarding passes for us."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,"loved staying here! will definitely be back, the location is perfect, close to the beach and the promenade. the staff at the front desk are very helpful and will go out of their way to make sure you&amp;#39;re happy.   i just wish the washing machines were in use (also there was no noise from the renovations)    one of the only negative things i have to say is that the common room could use a little tidy up, but other than that everything is kept pretty clean   thank you hi los angeles - santa monica!! "
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast. the perfect spot to stay in santa monica!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,this hostel is great and they try really hard to improve the atmosphere of the hostel by running all sorts of events each night of the week. dispite this i still found this was some what lacking due to the other travelers. rooms were good and clean as too were the showers. i've read some reviews about the showers being cold; i didn't find this to be the case at all.
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,staff was amazing! location is by everything! also had great events.. really recommend if you&amp;#39;re there friday night to do the limo party downtown hollywood. would go back in a heart beat i loved it so much!!
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,8,8,6,"hostel is in a great location, safe neighborhood, within walking distance of everything you could need (including the beach and pier). could of been a little bit cleaner but it wasn&amp;#39;t disgusting. would definitely stay there again! :)"
Ireland,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"can&amp;#39;t reccomend it enough. perfect location, clean, safe, lovely staff. very enjoyable stay overall."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,great hostel but it&amp;#39;s the reception staff and there above standard efforts that will make me come back!!
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,4,10,10,6,8,6,8,"great location but still can&amp;#39;t get over the price  - stayed here because theres no better option for the price but come on - i guess can&amp;#39;t win em all .. people didn&amp;#39;t really seem like talking in my room of 6 but i never made it to any of the common areas, maybe its different there"
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,weird no alcohol rule but other than that the hostel was amazing! go to the parking lot across the street for a great view of the city for free!
Colombia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,same breakfast everyday -_- but its free so yeah....
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this was the first time that i stayed in a hostel of any kind. i purchased a membership and getting ready to book my next trip today.....two blocks from the ocean in santa monica, who knew.  it was great."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,didn't spend much time there but location was excellent and hostel seemed really cool
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"no complaints, i mean you guys have a fireplace. i once saw one of those when i was kid peeking through rich peoples homes and the showers were kinda cold but with the drought i bet your saving a lot of water. i see what you did there."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was initially only planning on staying 3 nights here but ended up staying 11 because i loved it here so much! great atmosphere, great for meeting people, spacious rooms and prime location, thank you so much guys !!"
Germany,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is awesome! maybe the best hostel i ever stayed in. staff is super friendly and helpful. big kitchen,  pool billard,  fireplace and lots of chilled areas to hang out. the is close during the day and pub crawl is fun at night."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"i stayed just one day at this hostel. nice one. but it does not have that atmosphere i´ve seen in other. maybe because it´s too big, seens like a hotel. i just didn´t like the shower (you can´t control the temperature, and it was quite cold, so i wish the shower were warmer). considering there isn´t hostels in that region, i recommend this hostel for those who wants to be near the pier and the beach in santa monica."
China,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"santa monica is really beautiful! there's also an amusement park there, just beside the sea!!! the sunshine is amazing, and it's just 3minutes' walk from the hostel! the 10-bed dorm is quiet and the breakfast is quite nutritious hhh the big blue bus is convenient to connect santa monica with downtown la, but remember: never go to downtown when it gets dark."
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,6,8,8,8,"location is fantastic for this place and staff is very helpful with questions. beds are very uncomfortable and rooms were unbearably hot at night, but you get what you pay for. overall definitely worth the money to stay here. i recommend!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"wifi worked perfectly all through the hostel, the staff were super helpful when asked questions, the place was super clean and in general just an awesome place to stay! thank you!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,perfect location for santa monica. all the standard facilities for your hi hostels. activities daily. laundry unavailable at the moment due to refurbishment is the only thing i can fault. good base for la
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,6,10,need to finish the tv room and roof. good luck with the construction works!
England,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,great. shame that some facilities were not available due to refurbishments but i don't think it's fair to hold that against an enxcellent hostel.  hi's are some of the best hostels around!
Brazil,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"localization is great. just be aware of taxes in santa monica: 14%. employees at the front desk were confused. it seemed they didn't know how reservations using hostelworld worked, so they wanted to charge us more, despite of the money we had already paid online. but the hostel has good vibe."
Canada,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,4,6,8,8,"to be fair, the hostel was going through some renovations when i was there, they didn't disturb me but i was very bummed there was no laundry facilities available. this is the only hostel i have ever stayed in where they give you 2 pillows, which was nice. the hostel was good and i would stay again. the shuttle back to the airport is dumb. i booked it, it never showed up, and the hostel did not return my $2 booking fee and called me a taxi. i was not impressed by that."
USA,Female,31-40,8,8,10,10,6,10,6,6,the room was stuffy &amp; stinky. the heat was way too high. good breakfast but the same everyday so by day 4 it's not appealing.
Mexico,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this place. they were really kind to let me do an early check in for no charge, i'm very thankful about that 'cause i was exhausted.  the place is shiny and clean, spacious, well lighted, breakfast was good, the kitchen is excellent, the common areas are comfortable. great location, just a quick walk from the beach and the santa monica pier, and many bus stops. it's a very safe neighborhood and full of life. i'm coming back!!"
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything is great and i enjoyed my stay very much:)
Palestine,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,10,6,"i'll just state the cons, wifi is very very slow,there is no hot water , sometimes the toilet is dirty. "
England,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,10,8,6,6,8,everything you need. two minute walk to the pier and the beach and ten minutes to really great shops and restaurants and also a big supermarket. staff lovely. lots of construction going on when i was there so didn't experience outdoor area/tv room or laundry so can't rate! nice free breakfast and fast free wifi. really like the lounge area with the open fire too. small dorms are just right and beds really comfy. kitchen also really good. travel place next door good for booking trips. 
Brazil,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,amazing location and everything!!! 
England,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"excellent location. absolutely perfect for what you want, 2 minute walk from the beach and the shops! "
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,found a bunch of local residents dancing salsa in the streets just a couple blocks north of the hostel - great atmosphere and experience!
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,8,6,it's a great hostel but their wifi is really bad. it don't work!!!
China,Female,18-24,7.4,6,10,10,6,8,4,8,the location is very good and the staff are helpful too. the room is clean and the kitchen is big. the only problem is that they don't provide a friendly talking area so most time i stay there alone. that's kind of boring to me.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,have a savory option for breakfast
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"great location! friendly staff and excellent security.  wonderful to meet people from around the world! too bad the renovations were still ongoing during my stay.  maybe, next time i can use the tv and washer facility.  thank you!  ed from kansas city, mo"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,6,8,in comparison to other hostels its quite anonymous
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"we stayed at the hi hostel in santa monica for three nights. the room was cleaned every morning. the reception was located right where one entered to go to the common area and the rooms, which felt very safe. good breakfast. the staff did their best to help us with our questions. the hostel was being renovated during our stay, so many doors were open and there was a cold constant draft. the wifi was not very reliable but the staff helped us with one of our bookings."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,met my expectations. everything was perfect except the outlet up on my bunk bed that will not charge due to socket was too loose but i will come back again. excellent free breakfast compliment.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,great location and friendly staff. 
SouthAfrica,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great hostel, great location only two issues was that the wifi connection was not stable and in the evenings it was non-existent, water was not hot and as such one had to contend with tepid showers on a daily basis."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wow, this hostel sets a new standard in hostels.  the place felt like i was in a luxury hotel, with the fireplace lounge etc.  i'll definitely be back to use the clubtour and other services offered.  great time.  dp"
Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nice hostel and nice people
Poland,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,great place. i've been in many others hostels but this one lkeit most. very friendly girls on a front desk create great atmosphere
Australia,Female,18-24,4,4,6,6,2,2,2,6,pretty bad that no one told us that the hostel was under construction and that we would be woken up early by hammering. also no alcohol is let inside and most common rooms are closed so the atmosphere in the hostel sucked. it's relatively inexpensive but as a hostel it felt more like a hotel i was sharing with a bunch of random people. pretty lame and would not recommend as a lone traveller.
England,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"good place, brilliant location, but half the facilities closed including tv room and laundry!"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,6,6,"there was renovations happening while i was staying, meaning no washing services at all (the best they could do was tell me to walk 25mins to a laundromat) and many common rooms were closed. also wish that i knew that the hostel was a dry hostel without a bar or even allowed to drink at all on premises. due to the renovations forget about sleeping past 9am after a big night, lots of loud banging and work being done. location is brilliant but some forewarning about the above would have been nice."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had one of the best stays ever at a hostel. the only downer was the wifi was bog-slow.
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,10,10,6,6,6,10,"wish i was warned about all the renovation going on during my stay.  also the daytime staff were not too friendly overall, but the night staff were great and helpful!"
Ukraine,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i've ever been
France,MixedGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,breakfast was not great  water in showers is not really warm
China,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,you are supposed to provide the washing machine
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i have stayed in. friendly staff, loads organised to help you explore and meet new people. decent rooms with a personal light plus socket for each. breakfast was also decent.    location is perfect too - minutes from both the shops and beach!"
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,this place is vast and like a super hostel. wouldn't say it's the best spot for solo travellers as can feel like you're rattling around the hallways. location is great and staff were always helpful.
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,10,4,4,8,great location but the hosts is huge so there isn't any hostel vibe to it. the breakfast is super boring but it's at least included. 
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,overall this was a great stay. i had no issues and everything was really easy. location is especially excellent.
USA,Female,18-24,5.7,6,10,10,4,4,4,2,i was flying into long beach and i emailed the desk asking if they had any suggestions for getting there without a car. their reply was very abrasively suggesting that i google it myself. rude.     their wifi was spotty and their free breakfast was probably the worst i've seen from all the free breakfasts at hostels. their drains in showers didn't really work.     location is great though. and that's all that really matters. 
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"awesome hostel! breakfast was cereal, apples,coffee, milk and juice. love my stay"
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location!!! great staff!!! i will stay there any chance i get!!! i feel so fortunate to have discovered it!!!
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,we would definitely stay here again!
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i would like to comment on the staff!  all the staff were absolutely amazing   they never hesitated to help with any enquires we had  the went above and beyond there call of duty to accommodate any needs or enquires we put past them! very friendly and understanding of my son who has autism! what can i say! well done to all involved! thanks for making our holiday a memorable time   kindest regards   rosie &amp; josh
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,we had a great time at this hostel! loved the location - close to the beach and shopping. the breakfast was also great. the rooms were a little small though and not enough showers. would stay here again!
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,10,10,6,8,8,8,there were no wash cloths in the room; it would have been nice to have some in the shower room.  the people at the desk were very nice!  i especially appreciated the man who answered me very honestly about  safety walking late at night in relation to the homeless people.
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,6,8,"the hostel is in a great location, the staff was very helpful to get our room and even put our party in a  4 dorm room that was very nice to inform us that there was still rooms ave label ;  and the staff was very nice and helpful  we came up to celebrate a b day and we had a very nice time and made great memories   thank you for all the hard work the hostel staff puts in every day  i do enjoy my stays with the hostels very much  thank you cemile"
England,Female,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"fantastic front of house staff, very welcoming and helpful when i had a question. location is amazing! just 2 blocks from santa monica beach!!"
Austria,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,8,6,6,6,"great location  wifi completely unusable, too slow, websites hardly load  bathrooms quite dirty and old."
Denmark,Female,18-24,7.7,10,10,6,4,8,6,10,"over all, i enjoyed my stay.   but wifi was very poor!   and non of the computers were working, which made me nervous because you have to slide your credit card  to use the computer, which i btw find weird that you have to pay to use them."
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,10,8,"this hostel is absolutely amazing, location is 100% i definitely recommend"
England,Male,31-40,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,staff were very approachable especially bevin. the wifi however was terrible 
Argentina,Couple,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the place is great, excellent location and service, the stuff is really nice and helpful. you can go anywhere in santa monica by foot, or take a bus to any of the interesting places of la just around the corner. great value for money."
Romania,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was cool!
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,"great location, nice rooms! overall good stay but by that hostel like, more hotel atmosphere!"
England,Couple,25-30,6.3,4,6,8,6,6,6,8,"good location very near to the beach and the pier. lots of places to eat and drink nearby. clean and tidy.    sadly, the wifi was slow to the point of utter uselessness and the 'free breakfast' was a tiny box of cereal, with optional slices of apple.    h.i. say they aim to help young people travel. which travelling young person can afford $50 per night for 10-person dorm? it costs a couple $100 per night ($600 per week) to stay in separate rooms. wouldn't recommend it to anybody. use airbnb."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,10,10,4,8,2,10,"the hostel needs to add a social event every night and throughout the days, i found the hostel was large but very antisocial.   and ive stayed at multiple hi hostels and out of about 10 of them this is the only one that dosnt have air conditioning! you desperately need it!!!!!"
Denmark,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,lack off ac makes the rooms hot and unbearable .. and the in the rooms are to skinny. you could just sleep without a madras
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, only complaint would be no air con, was soooo humid which made it hard to sleep at night. loved the atmosphere and facilities were great and clean."
England,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,no a.c way to hot. only stayed 1 out of the 5 i was supposed to because there was no a.c. other than that good hostel. 
Ukraine,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,they should install air condition
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"right next to the santa monica pier and wonderful, modern hostel. staff were super helpful as well; needed a taxi to lax at 5 in the morning and we told him at 4:50am as uber surged. the lounges were fantastic to chill in and the outside indoor piece was great. "
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,6,10,10,staff weren't the best. although they were helpful when you asked for something they weren't particularly friendly compared to the other hi hostels i've been to on my trip. but nice facilities. they need aircon in the rooms though - it gets unbearably hot at night! 
Germany,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,in general it is perfect to stay....a lot of possibilities to do! the only problem is the heat in the rooms- no ac which makes it hard to breath- but you will survive your stay thou!✌️😄
Germany,Male,18-24,6.6,4,8,8,4,10,8,4,"no a/c, can't sleep very well at night because of extreme heat."
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location and hostel was good. i feel as though there could be more activity nights and there should be drinking allowed in the room. would also prefer to have mixed dorms. all round good hostel but for 3x couples and the price we would stay elsewhere next time.
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,i only stayed for one night but i'm really glad that i did as this was one of the best hostals i stayed in through my trip to la.
Sweden,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"a bit run down hostel in samta monica, only a couple of blocks from the beach and the pier. many dorms and floors, not easy to meet people if you're a solo traveller. santa monica is a great area with lots of stores, restaurants and entertainment at night. stay here!"
Argentina,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever!
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,best hostel ever!!!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"excellent location between the beach and the boulevard for a reasonable price, and i would stay here again just for that fact (especially since i had no desire to head into downtown la), but i find hi hostels are much too sterile and lack atmosphere, and also usually too big which makes it hard to meet people. apart from that, no real issues and would still recommend people stay here."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome hostel thanks
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,4,10,6,8,the hostel is in the perfect location and  staff are very friendly and able to help with any questions. however the lack of air cinditoning leads to some very uncomfortable nights in warm weather. the fans  don't do much to cool the room down. it is only value for money if staying on your ownown and becase it is the only hostel in the city. unless the air conditoning is fixed or prices dropped this place is going to lose most its business to airbnb
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location with easy access to the city and beach. beds were comfortable and outdoor area was perfect for socializing or spending time alone. definitely recommend.
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great time here, fantastic location, especially if you have a rental car - there is a parking lot across the road that does 24h parking for $14. inside the hostel, staff are friendly and helpful, the beds are good and clean - if not a bit small! linen provided is clean and plentiful. facilities are great throughout, lots of space to relax and enjoy yourself. really good free breakfast available, take advantage of this. the rooms need air conditioning though, it's unbearably hot    in the summer!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"love the hostel, and have stayed there in previous travels as it has a fantastic atmosphere, good security and nice atmosphere.  the only things that i was disappointed with was:  1. temperature of room. uncomfortably hot 24hrs. there was a fan however it was fixated on one person and couldn't be changed. i estimate it was 38-40 degrees. much hotter than outside in the evenings!!!  2. breakfast 3 item limit."
Singapore,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's a really nice place with a beautiful patio and good security! but the room is really hot because there was only one fan in the 8 bed room. would be nice if we had individual small fans in our personal bed area though! the location is excellent, no doubt about it."
Scotland,Male,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,8,8,6,4,was like staying in an oven ! no air con in the rooms !!!!!
Finland,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"couldn't have asked for more, thanks again! special kudos for the ability to print."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,10,6,6,4,6,the location is unbeatable! it's not far to get to places and even venice seems to be pretty close. it's just a walk along the beach to get there. but i would rather recommend to stay in a hostel in venice than here if you're planning to connect with people. i was traveling on my own and it was way easier to connect in other hostels (venice included!). this hostel is more lika a large hotel where everyone stays anonymous.
Panama,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"pro's: friendly staff, clean kitchen facility, lounge facility, rooms to stays...     con's: water temperature for shower was slightly hot, second floor men's bathroom was humid, hot, steamy, no air ventilation.."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i read all the reviews about the heat issue but decided to stay anyway, hi hostels are awesome (i've stayed in 3) but this location doesn't have ac in the rooms, and the wifi is slow, so these are the two things that let it down. huge hostel, free breakfast, location is fantastic (close to santa monica pier, shopping, restaurants, buses) they have multiple common areas, computers to use (small fee), the beds are comfy, so honestly guys, fix the heat problem &amp; you will have a 5/5!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great location to the beach and the central area of santa monica including shops and night life. however we were there in september, which certainly isn't the hottest time in california, and the rooms were like a sauna. it was impossible to be in there for any more time than absolutely necessary and getting to sleep at night was a nightmare. we stayed there for 3 nights and if it were any longer i would have changed hostels. it was far too hot and ruined sleep for the next day."
England,Male,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,10,8,4,4,great facilities not so great atmosphere. i'd say if you're travelling alone pick a different hostel if you're travelling with a group this is a great place.
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"only stayed one night. it was nice place to stay. i would come back, definitely. close to bars and entertainment. the area is extremely nice. clean, good breakfast, nice staff... ideal!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,4,8,6,10,it was very hot in the rooms making it impossible to sleep
England,Female,25-30,8,6,10,10,6,8,6,10,"this is the third time i've stayed at this property, usually i love it, but ths time the heat in the room was just unbearable. one fan for a small room with 10 people and a shower in isn't good enough. such a shame because everything else was great! fab location!"
Chile,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i absolutely love this hostel.  have been in it a few times and is always great. is very big and spacious, the rooms and bathrooms are always clean and nice. the common area is super nice specially in a hot day, and the breakfast is good.  the location is perfect, 2 minutes walk to the 3rd promenade where the main restaurants and stores are, and less than 10 minutes to the santa monica pier and beach.  staff is always helpful and nice, and have met some great people.  would always come back! "
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.1,6,10,8,8,6,4,8,great location. everything you need. 
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,nice place to relax your sunburnt body
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.7,4,10,10,8,6,8,8,the location is very good as well as the breakfast.
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,6,10,10,8,i enjoyed my stay however sleeping at night became unbearable in the heady and the one fan did nothing. i would have liked more fans to make sleeping at night comfortable. in the women's bathroom on the 4th floor it would have been convenient to have cubicals or an area to get changed in private after taking a shower. the breakfast was great!
USA,Female,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,i really loved it here. close to the beach and nice staff . love the lockers to store all of my stuff in- they are huge and 5 bucks a day
Panama,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"pro's: clean dormitory, friendly and upbeat front desk staff, clean share communal kitchen, computer room, clean lounge area, clean bathroom within dormitory area, presentable linen arrangement on bedding area., decent breakfast, supermarkets/restaurants/cafés within walking distance and nearby, retail stores within nearby walking distance...     con's: my bag of groceries and along w/medication that had to refrigerated was stolen within 24 hours of my stay even though it was labeled w/my name"
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,4,8,6,6,6,6,4,"cold showers, no ac in the room, slow wifi, toilets that had overflown and stayed like that for longer then they should, also a cockaroach crawled across the couch one night while in the tv room while i was just trying to relax. it surprisingly wasn't the worsts hostel i have stayed at, but for the amount of money you end up spending you might as well split a hotel with some of your friends. at the very least i would find another hostel."
Canada,Male,25-30,6.6,4,10,8,8,6,2,8,general ambiance: imagine a detox center. 
Thailand,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,good location. many activities. friendly staff.
NorthernIreland,Female,25-30,7.1,4,10,10,8,6,4,8,very good facilities and great location but zero atmosphere.
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"everything was very clean, which is a top priority with me.  breakfast was very modest, so don't expect much.  but they didn't seem to limit the coffee.  nice places to relax with your electronic devices."
England,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,"my room was pretty basic and there was no air con so the room was boiling however a friend was staying in another room which was huge and much cooler so not all the same. i've stayed here twice now as the location is just perfect. i would return again. good common areas, big kitchen all in all a good stay and would recommend "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location and cool chill out spaces. maybe make breakfast a little but more known
Germany,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"stayed in room 403 and overall nights get really hot up there. would recommend to stay on second level, but already the 3rd floor  is quite heated up. even with 2(!) fans on it was almost too hot to sleep."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,8,8,10,10,i enjoyed my stay at the hi however... air conditioning should be added to each room. without this is was unbearable in my dorm with 7 other people. the fans should also be updated as our fan did not work correctly.
Germany,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,10,6,6,"room was too hot, no cold showers"
England,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,8,10,6,8,10,looks like a plush hotel from the outside. nice rooms and beds with good breakfast. staff competent in booking things for you but also seemed they wanted to be elsewhere half the time.
Hungary,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"very convenient if you want to stay in the santa monica area, the rooms aren't too crowded, and awesome breakfast!"
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,staff were very helpful. not the cheapest of places but the location made it an excellent overall choice for a few days stay in santa monica
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i've stayed here before and had an excellent time. this time tho the room was unbearably hot. window open fan going. unbearable. i also think i was in an older section, not renovated. i've been in the newer, smaller dorm rooms. those are much better."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"the showers aren't hot enough. the breakfast in perfect! also, there are not enough washing machine between 3pm to 11pm  since they are reserved for the staff."
NewZealand,AllMaleGroup,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,6,10,"great location, facilities and staff.  a little on the expensive side though for a hostel.   "
Poland,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,8,6,"good location for going to the santa monica beach. good prize for a bed. this is an option esspecially if travelling alone, as in a regular hotel or for an ensuite room, you need to pay for the whole room, i.e. two beds etc.. the room and the bathroom/toilet were not clean (also because of poor useage by the residents). breakfast was included, but as it is often the case if you need something more than a coffee and a toast with grape jelly you need to eat out anyway."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"amazing location, very safe environment. lots of public spaces and beautiful courtyard, nice breakfast. overall great experience, would recommend :)"
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were very friendly and helpful. public muliti story car park on the opposite side of the road so if your driving, this is the place to stay. it's 14 dollars for 24hr parking"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,"this hostel was good, clean, well managed and fresh. it wasn't that great for meeting people but in all other respects nice."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location, excellent staff and very clean!"
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,6.6,4,8,10,4,8,6,6,the room and the restroom were very warm so it was hard to take a rest and put on an makeup. the light of the room was not that bright. the breakfast was not satisfying.
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great location, rooms can get hot in peak of summer but the fans really helped."
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this was my first hosteo experience ever. staying at this hostel has forever changed my opinion on hostels. loved it!! amazing, amazing, amazing!!!"
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,"pros   location excellent, very clean, staff approachable and friendly (with a smile) and the breakfast was good. i would of liked to have had access to boiling water for tea etc through the day and evening.     cons  the room was a too hot, atmosphere a little boring and the internet was way to slow for me to read my emails etc i was relying on the internet to be working to let my family know i arrived safe to los angeles. the prices are too expensive for a hostel.    regards,  leon"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,a nice hostel and probably the cheapest place to crash in gaslamp.  the atmosphere was pretty chill and i found it easier to mesh with other residents.    the front staff were super friendly and offered great advice and suggestions.
England,Female,31-40,7.4,2,10,10,8,8,8,6,by the beach. definitely worth staying here for at least a night if you are on an adventure around la. definitely overpriced. they charge you extra when you arrive. it's in the small print so they aren't doing anything wrong legally but travellers are usually on a tight budget so it would be nice to be upfront about costs. the wifi doesn't work. the staff will tell you it's your device. go to the coffee bean on the street corner if you do need wifi. great walking tour provided.
Italy,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,a bit expensive but very well placed.
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"excelent location, 1 block from the beach and near to the 3rd street promenade, where you can find all types of shops. if you stay there, you don't need a car to enjoy santa monica beach and venice beach. sometimes, especially in the morning, the toillets were not that clean..."
Japan,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"i stayed for 2 nights. one in 10 females dorm and the other night in 6 females dorm. the both rooms didn't feel small and in fact it was comfortable enough. after 10 pm,they have a policy that you have to try to be quiet for other guests. the place at night was quieter than any other hostels i have stayed before.  the staff members at the front desk were always nice and kind.  bathroom cleanliness could be improved,but you get what you paid for.  the location is awesome."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wifi is really bad
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,hi hostels are a good. the staff were helpful and kind. the location was perfect for me as i wanted to stay in a more beach like environment. venice beach and the most popular santa monica pier are right next to the hostel and if you want to travel further the blue bus line stops a block away. the only problems were the one of the landry dryers didn't work properly and i wasted two loads($2.00) and the sheets had stains that looked like blood spots but stain on sheets are expected at hostel
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,10,10,8,2,the ladies bathroom on 3rd floor had blocked toilets for 24 hours. the stench was so bad couldn't use it. beds are comfortable. large lockers provided.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wifi didn't work in the rooms or the building
Austria,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"breakfast milk was disgusting, sorry!"
England,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"coming from australia new zealand this hostel feels more like a hotel, especially enjoyed the wifi and towel!"
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,nicest hostel i've stated in and perfect location. only a five minute walk to everything. only downside is the rooms have no air conditioning and is brutally hot.
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a great stay here. fantastic location and really good free breakfast! the room i stayed in had plenty of room and the bed was comfortable. would definitely recommend staying here. 
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel!!!!
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,i really enjoyed my stay.  the location is perfect!  breakfast was good - nothing fancy but was perfectly fine.  the facilities were really great and i had everything i needed.  it was a good mix of ages staying here too which was nice. definitely recommend.
Netherlands,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,8,6,the 6 men dorm was small and really hot. there were two fans in the room but no ac.
Germany,Male,31-40,7.1,4,10,10,6,6,6,8,very well kept in a location and promenade . wifi slowakei and unreliable
Chile,Male,25-30,6,4,8,6,8,4,4,8,bad wifi; no air conditioner; always the same breakfast(but it is good( milk;cereal;fruit;yogurth;bread;cake)  people too cold.  the location is very good; although at la you will need a car.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,great location and a great atmosphere. only downside was the rooms were quite hot as there was no air con.   definitely will be staying again :)
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"the hostel is really well located. next to the pier and 3rd street. as almost all hi hostels, it is not a party hostel.  the bathroom is big enough and always clean. the breakfast is good with toast, fruits and cereals."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,it was a really nice hostel thank you so much
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic hostel in great location
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"i love this hostel, the location is great!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,10,10,2,10,8,8,im only rating very poor for facilities due to the lack of air conditioning. rooms were like a sauna making it very uncomfortable to sleep.
Spain,Male,25-30,8.9,4,10,10,8,10,10,10,"really good hostel, but so expensive for what you get"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the facilities and location were perfect for anyone touring la and the coast,  however there is no alcohol allowed in the hostel which really kills the atmosphere and makes it a far less social hostel than most."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, excellent activities, could use ac"
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,6,10,8,10,6,4,10,"very clean, but huge!  modern building, but unfortunately there's no atmosphere.  still had a good time. quite comfortable beds!"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly staff, clean rooms/bathroom, great location. travel shop right next door, easy to book day tours.   great for 5 days or so.  cheers"
England,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,10,4,10,"great clean hostel, a bit more expensive than some but amazing breakfast and communal areas. not a great atmosphere as the hostel is so big, but if you want somewhere more chilled then this place is great"
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,8,8,10,it's very close to the beach. i liked that. it's a bit pricy though like any other hostels in la. the thing that bothered me most was that i am not allowed to drink alcohol inside the hostel. i should have known that hi (hosteling international) hostels have no alcohol drinking allowed policy.
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,10,8,6,8,it should be advertised on the website that the hostel is alcohol free.   breakfast is excellent!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"as a solo female traveller, this place was perfect. very clean and safe. the location is unreal! i think santa monica is the best place to stay is los angeles and i enjoyed my time here. i am returning on my next trip but with my boyfriend and would love to stay at this hostel but there's no private rooms or mixed rooms. thank you :)"
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,8,6,"great location close to the beach!  i was on the 4th floor and it was miserable hot up there. they had multiple fans in the room but it didn't help very much. it was difficult to sleep because it was so hot in the room.  other than that, great hostel. would definitely recommend it."
England,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, a short walk to the pier and a few streets down from the main shopping area."
Canada,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,8,6,bathrooms need a serious update!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"will be staying once a week on business, and i could't be happier with choosing hi."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,in my opinion really good. good location and all that but still really expensive for a hostel.
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,4,10,8,8,10,6,8,"staff was nice and helpful.  pretty good selection of events and entertainment.  location is very good - a few blocks to the beach, and in the middle of santa monica shops and restos.  downside to the central location is the noise. may depend on which side of the building you're on.  nice facilities, but not a ton of character -- a little sterile.  dorms were good, clean, nice lockers, bedside light and plugs.  bathroom facilities good and not crowded at all.  bike room was a nice bonus!"
Egypt,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,8,10,6,6,"homeless people around, the room had bad smell (due to people staying in the same room). hostels in la in general are somehow expensive."
USA,Female,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,really nice. friendly staff
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this is one of my favourite hostels i've ever stayed at. the staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and comfortable. really impressed me! it's very clean and spacious. tours and activities organised everyday. a number of common areas. really easy to meet fellow travellers. only down side is it's uptown, which isn't a particularly interesting part of town. however, all the pro's make it worth the train ride downtown."
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"ver nice hostal, awesome location "
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,"room and bathroom very clean. a little expensive, but the hostel is a corner away from santa monica beach and pier. staff very nice and helpful. good spot if you want to shop too!"
Scotland,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"good location,  and plenty of space in common areas.  only there for one night but the wednesday night pub crawl was a definite highlight in later."
England,Female,25-30,4.3,2,6,8,2,4,4,4,very poor value for money. on arrival the staff were not very helpful.  for the money i would have expected a better breakfast where we were not limited to 2 food items and i would also expect that the majority of the poor selection of breakfast items would not run out prior to breakfast ending (this happened on 2 of the 3 days we stayed).  the showers whilst relatively clean practical. water went everywhere outside of the cubical and there was no private dry space to dress other than the toilet
Germany,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,amazing location and friendly staff. easy to get to the other locations in la because of easy public transportation. i definitely recommend this accommodation though the price is not cheap.
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place to stay! people are friendly, activity's are good, the receptionists are super friendly and helpful!    perfect location as well, only 5 mins from the pier and beach.    i will definitely stay here again!"
Wales,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a fantastic hostel. the location is literally perfect! la is so big that is almost impossible to stay in just one area of the city and still get to experience the city life/hills and tourism/the beaches and piers etc. so this hostel is perfect for those wanting to visit the beaches and famous pier. the neighbourhood is safe and secure and much classier than hollywood blvd hostels. great staff, clean rooms, easy access to transit. 5 star! definitely would recommend if visiting santa monica/la!!!"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,"expensive have to pay extra $3 a night if your not a hi member so bear this in mind, noisy if your next to the street. "
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,most of things are good. but what i am disappointed about is washroom. it was so small and kind of dirty. maybe it was just old. anyway i advice you that you renovate the washroom to make it bigger.
Italy,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i stayed here just for one night since i was doing a roadtrip but i liked it a lt, it was clea and the atmosphere was nice. the wifi worked everywhere and i liked the plugs in the room even for the upper beds! the breakfast was also very nice."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,big hostel that was very clean!!
Latvia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,8,6,8,"a bit noisy with windows open, great location though, good breakfast."
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,cool hostel 
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"nice, clean hostel. community restrooms don't allow much privacy, but we're always clean. large lockers for storage are a plus. the only issue i had was the housekeeper coming in to vacuum while i was asleep at 9am. i understand that quiet time is over at 8 but i thought she could have been a bit more tactful."
USA,Female,41+,8.9,4,10,10,10,10,8,10,"excellent location and friendly staff. this was my first time in a u.s. hostel so seemed pricey. same price gets me a beachfront hotel in costa rica or thailand :) however, very reasonable for the location. beach is 2 blocks. 3rd street promenade is 1 block away. great staff. great group hike. all ages. had a good time."
Germany,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,10,10,8,6,quite expensive for these mattress  at the second day they implemented a new breakfast policy which is ridiculous and doesn't reflect the price - you feel like a prisoner  building is nice and most of the equipment  room service should have separate laundry machine - had discussions about how many machines are currently in use by other guests
Philippines,Male,31-40,6.6,2,8,10,6,6,8,6,"hidden charges incurred due to a backpackers is not a member of there associations, if you stay in this hotel will charge you additional cost."
HongKong,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,4,8,6,10,"was want to get a orange juice but the machine go to take the energy drink, i don't know what's going on. and shower is not so hot.    but cleanliness is really good."
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"found a lot of the electrical power points were very intermittent when trying to use a usb charger. perhaps with so much use, they are worn out and need replacing. apart from that, an excellent place to stay."
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,the location of this hostel is absolutely amazing. it is right in the middle of everything. there are a lot of great stores and places to eat and the area is very beautiful and exciting. the hostel itself was great. it was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. my friend and i had very nice roommates and we met a lot of great people at the hostel that we are still friends with today(a year later). we hope to visit again! 
USA,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,10,10,4,6,8,"the staff at the front desk were very nice, but not very helpful with info. breakfast was excellent."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"perfect location, just 2 blocks drom the beach and third street. the hostel is not à party hostel but there are many nice bars around it. i would advice people to join the free tours. they aren't that great but you will meet people! tip 2; check out 'the bungalow'! real nice bar close to the hostel. à little pricy but worth it!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,i really liked the activities planned during the evenings. your location is perfect. thanks!
USA,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,8,8,10,this is a huge hostel in an busy downtown location. the prices change depending on demand. my first night was $48 in a 6-bed and it changed to as much as $68 per night in the same room. the 6 bed rooms are nice. they have a sink and a mirror. the 8 beds however were too crowded for my preference. i wished there were surge protectors in the lockers so we could charge our devices for a few hours when we're not in the room. the staff were friendly and helpful.
Scotland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"excellent hostel. very modern and clean, massive big dorm rooms with en suite toilet and showerroom. huge kitchen downstairs and lots of lounge space. amazing location, 2 mins walk away from the beach and santa monica pier, and 2 mins walk from the shopping district. hostel offers nightly entertainment which is always good value and a great way to meet people. would def recommend it!"
Australia,Female,31-40,8,6,10,10,8,8,6,8,"excellent location in santa monica. great free breakfast ( juice, coffee, fruit, cereal, bread, bagels) and free coffee throughout the day. lots of areas to go and sit. dorms are quite spacey with big lockers. beds have individual lights. not much atmosphere in the hostel but friendly enough. definitely not a  party place which was fine for me.  enjoyed my stay. just a bit expensive"
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"the excellent location and facilities definitely live up to what i've come to expect from hi locations. i felt the cost ($45/night) was a bit steep for a dormitory room, but if you're planning on spending most of your time in santa monica, it's probably worth it. if you're more interested in visiting other parts of la, you may want to consider staying nearer, as la's public transit is not great. if you have a car, there is a ton of cheap, 24/7 lots in sm (civic center garage is $5/day nearby)."
Italy,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,i had a good time there. it was very clean and even if there were 10 beds in the dorms they were confortable arranged. there is a nice patio in the middle and a big kitchen and dinning room. i really recommend this place.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,6,8,"accommodation in la is expensive. what you are paying for here is an exceptional location. the dorms and bathrooms are adequate, the breakfast is great, the activities are expensive, the common areas are nicely appointed but largely unwelcoming and there is no temperature control in either the rooms or the showers.  this hostel is somewhere between a b and b and a youth hostel, and be aware - there is a no alcohol policy!"
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had so much fun
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place and the free breakfast was awesome!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my first stay in this hostel and it was by far the best buy in town.  the staff were terrific, everything was immaculate, the facilities were very comfortable and inviting and the location was perfect.  great job to all the staff and thanks for a very nice stay!"
Russia,Male,25-30,7.1,4,8,10,8,6,8,6,"they tell you price would be 42$ in fact it appears become 50$. you stay in a room with 8-10 people. water in a shower is warm, but not enough. especially when i arrived it wasnt so hot outside and i wantted to warm up my body in a nice hot shawer and i couldn't do that!"
Germany,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"it's a nice location with only one corner from the beach.the stuff was nice and helpfull but unfortunately they don't have maps of la or recommedations for sight seeing.the rooms are clean and include lockers.the breakfast is basic with toast, jam, cereals and coffee.as a whole: a good place to stay"
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel. probably the best hostel i was staying in california. great location and pleasant atmosphere.
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,6,10,"everything was perfect, except for the wifi.  there should be more fun!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"rate it highly, real clean, staff are sweet. feels real safe"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"enjoyed my stay at the hostel. was planning to have a quiet night for my one night stopover in la anyway so didn't mind that the hostel was a ""non-party"" hostel but this might have bothered me if i was looking to meet people and have a fun night out."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"what an incredible place, and incredible people who work there, and stay there!  the hostel is very modern, clean, and really quite fancy for a hostel!  it was probably the most luxurious hostel i've ever stayed at, with large lounges to work, and a huge kitchen and eating area.  also, a nice courtyard to work outside! the rooms were immaculate, and they even make the beds and strip the linen for you, unusual for a hostel. they even have towels!  staff is super-friendly, helpful + professional!"
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,6,8,8,"pretty nice place to stay a couple of nights, but don't expect to make friends there. most people just keep to themselves, even in the shared rooms, so..."
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,great location
Germany,Male,41+,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,everything was ok
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel experience ever!!!!!  amazing breakfast!  nice staff!  clean!  location !  perfect!
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"excellent location, very close to the beach and the 3rd street promenade! the hostel offers different activities to help guests get to know la and make new friends. there are evenings when you can have dinner at the hostel, the food is good and cheap. i loved the pub crawl, it´s free and they take you to 3 or 4 different pubs and clubs near the hostel. room and bathroom clean and comfortable, hair dryer and bath soap available. breakfast is good too. elevator in the lobby. good value for money."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a wonderful stay at the santa monica hostel. i stayed for four nights and wouldn't have chosen anywhere else to stay. it's a short walk (5 minutes) to the beach, and just a block away from the third street promenade! lots of places to eat nearby as well. the helpful and friendly staff, group activities, and free breakfast were wonderful as well. thank you so much for giving me such an amazing experience!"
Russia,Female,25-30,5.1,2,10,10,4,6,2,2,the weirdest hostel i have ever stayed at ! people don't talk to each other  quite atmosphere  feels more like a hospital then hostel  quite hours starts from 10 pm ! what?! really ?! wouldn't recommend it if you travelling alone ! 
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,"excellent location right near santa monica pier/third street promenade. staying in santa monica is way better then staying in hollywood/downtown as the atmosphere is nicer. staff were very helpful with providing directions and also provided bolt cutters for a padlock incident. hostel organised a hike to temescal canyon on a sunday which was amazing! they had great volunteers and it was all made super easy. rooms were clean but a little hot. just a fan in rooms, not air conditioning."
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,10,6,8,"i had a great experience. location was perfect, it was easy to walk to the beach, and the 3rd street promenade is a minute walk away from the hostel - tons of restaurants and shops! the staff was very helpful when giving advice about the buses in la to get to hollywood. the breakfast was a nice bonus! the lockers were also an excellent size to fit everything i had with me."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"generally a good hostel with friendly staff, however would be even better if the staff we're a bit more informed about local activities, events etc."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,i only spent one night at this hostel but it was in an excellent spot not too far from anything! and super close to 3rd street promenade and santa monica place. the only complain was that i booked a 6bdrm dorm with ensuite but was put in a 4bdrm dorm with a shared bathroom. but like i said it was only 1 night so i didn't make a fuss. they had a comfy place to sleep at a great location with good wifi :)
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,great location. dorms very hot with no aircon
SriLanka,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,8,10,6,6,was one of the best hostels i've  stayed at. the staff is very nice! is a place i would definitely stay there again! 
England,Female,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,"staff were brilliant, fab location for the shops, bus links and beach. the complimentary breakfast was vey good. they assign beds to each person in the dorm, which people don't stick to which makes it a bit of a pain come bed time, it would probably be better to leave it unreserved. a bit steeply priced in my opinion, but a good hostel overall."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,thx for the great time! i´ll definitely be back!
Sweden,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,jättebra läge ett stenkast från stranden. väldigt bra säkerhet med kortläsare överallt. superbra tvättmöjligheter. ganska dyrt som de flesta hostel i denna stad men ändå prisvärt. frukosten är väl inte jättespännande och kunde vara lite bättre för det priset men den funkar helt klart.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,10,8,4,10,"note: alcohol free hostel!! pretty much says it's all. if your looking for a fun time to social and meet others, don't stay here. if you would like a quiet place to stay then it's perfect. great faculties, breakfast and beds. but if your up for a fun time, look elsewhere, no alcohol and too many common rooms, lack of social activities makes it difficult to interact and meet other travellers. "
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,6,8,the atmosphere wasn't the best but the accommodations were very nice and the staff really accommodating! we had so much fun in santa monica we stayed one extra day!!
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,"its right on the beach, walking distance from the pier and endless shopping and restaurants. pub crawl was fun and all the tours stop at the hostel. the rooms with en-suite bathrooms were spacious and clean. i do not suggest the vip limo tour, unless you just want to pay $50 to ride there and back in a limo. but don't expect all the free drinks and club cover charges. the tour guide bought one cheap bottle of vodka for 20+ people and the clubs were all free entry."
USA,Female,31-40,6.6,4,8,8,6,6,8,6,"mattresses were not comfortable, they should be upgraded  a little too pricey for a hostel in general especially for a private room, $129 and you don't get your own bathroom!  overall nice facility, nice ambiance in the common areas, friendly staff, nice big kitchen"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"fantastic location, in walking distance of most things. brekky included, nice!"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel, met some amazing people! central, close to the beach and 3rd sheet prom, venice beach and the pier! def coming back here!!!!"
USA,Female,41+,8.6,4,10,10,8,8,10,10,"this is a very nice hostel, perfect location, clean and quiet. my only complaint is the price seemed quite high for a hostel. $55 for room of 4-6 beds."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,"included breakfast is always good, although there wasn't heaps of variety. kitchen facilities and general socialising areas were really nice. bathrooms were okay but not great. my bed was quite uncomfortable but the location is fantastic if you want to see the santa monica area."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,6,10,it's in a nice place with nice staff but it lacks an atmosphere. i'd say something like a bbq in the courtyard would allow people to mix more freely rather than having people sit on opposite sides of tables at breakfast not speaking
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"excellent staff, very friendly and know their stuff. good location and perfect spot for a little getaway"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"we only stayed here for 1 night as we had a stopover in la. the hostel is in a great location. only a 5 minute walk from 3rd street promenade and about 10 minutes from santa monica pier. the staff are really helpful and the hostel is very clean and has great facilities. there are many cosy common areas to hang out and the breakfast which is provided is great. there is toast, bagels, fruit and yoghurt, cereal and juice and coffee."
France,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,amazing location and very good premises. atmosphere and breakfast were uninspiring though. us price for dorm bed (excessive). 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"great location in santa monica - right by third street promenade and the beach and pier. easy walk to everything!   staff were lovely and super helpful.  had to pay for luggage storage of more than 2 hours after checking out which was a bit of a bummer.  but great communal areas - kitchen, lounge rooms and a lovely fire for reading next to!  beds were super comfy and bathrooms were clean."
China,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,good location! helpful and friendly stuff! just two blocks away from the beach and there're some good restaurants nearby.
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,6,4,6,not enough activities for tourists on their own. breakfast was very average and being in a room with 9 others wasn't an enjoyable experience.
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,8,8,10,"best part is the location -- right near beach, pier, 3rd street promenade. cost $1 to get to from lax via bus. great hostel, although too expensive: including all taxes and fees it costs me $50/night as a non-member in a 6-bed dorm. showers don't have heat options, it's just an on/off knob, so they are warm but not hot. dorm rooms are great -- every bed has its own outlets and light. wifi is good. bonus points for charming open areas like a fireplace room and atrium. decent breakfast."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very clean and professional. my favorite place in la so far...

SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,here's breakfast is very very good!!!!!!!!!!!  i love +_+ hahahaha    most of part is good
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,8,8,2,10,"this is a really nice hostel, however it is a hi-hostel. as a hi-hostel they have figured out how to make everything so efficient and predictable that the hostel has no soul or character. however, the location is decent and the breakfast is ok. the hostel is a little on the pricey side. if you want a hostel that is actually interesting and not out to simply make a profit i wouldn't recommend this hostel. also, the hostel is so huge and cold it is really hard to meet people."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my stay was excellent while i was there. the staff were beyond helpful. the breakfast included (toast, mini bagels, yogurt, cereal and canned peaches) a minor suggestion to take this hostel a step higher assorted menu selections of both hot and cold breakfast. waffle/pancakes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and or pastry danishes. those would mean the world to travelers.i loved the fact the hostel was literally a block away from the beach. many of food places and store near by that came in handy."
Vietnam,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"this hostel has great location for the value, right at the center of santa monica and near to everything. you can pretty much walk to most of the points of interest. staff are very helpful and awesome. hostel often organizes fun events at discounted rates such as hiking and sightseeing. they are pretty insightful about what to do in santa monica and the la area. had a great time there interacting with the staff and meeting up with the other guests."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very easy place to find, not far from lax air port, staff are very helpful and friendly.  would be very happy to come back again. "

Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,better showers would really help.. and it's too expensive for a hostel..  
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay here. so much that i stayed for longer than expected... and came back again!! great location, only a 5 min walk to the beach and then a short walk to the shops too. staff are extremely friendly and help in any way they can. would definitely recommend this hostel."
Australia,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,4,8,8,6,"the shower could have been better. i can live without a strong water flow, but the water needed to be hotter than just above warm."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the location is one of my favorite places to visit and the local community is very friendly.   there is convenient shopping for almost anything you may need. 
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,10,4,"the hostel team is very helpful. location is excellent!  but, at the hostel's bathroom was a huge cockroach."
Turkey,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,nice place
Wales,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"nice stay, comfy beds, clean shower and awesome location.  the only negative i found was that there wasn't a good atmosphere.  it was very quiet and people kept themselves to them selves."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,hi santa monica  is a model hostel in a terrific area. 
Japan,Female,25-30,6,4,6,8,6,6,6,6,i could not sleep well because of someone's or something's making noise.
USA,Male,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the place has a friendly, helpful bunch of staff."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"very clean, comfortable hostel in the perfect location only a block from the beach. close to restaurants and all santa monica tourist activities. facilities were great. i was hoping to participate in some hostel activities but seemed most were getting canceled, i think because there weren't many people around. a bit of a loud area with construction on the street outside but we were warned of this and i'm sure at a normal time that this isn't a problem. overall it was a great hostel!"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a shame that you can't drink alcohol in the hostel... would be way better if you could!! other than that everything was great and the staff were all so helpful :)
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"the breakfasts were full of sugar... too much in my opinion, and not enough selection of cereals (i hate cornflakes). otherwise it was a really great experience."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best and cleanest places to stay in the area, and very convenient to the beach."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"very helpful staff, great location and perfect alternative to staying in downtown la. the breakfast was great and there are plenty of cool spaces to relax. would highly recommend."
Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"very well located, it's at the heart of san monica and very close to the beach! the facilities are very nice and clean. the rooms are okay."
PuertoRico,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,what a great location. 2 blocks from the beach. can't beat the price of you are ok with staying in a hostile. met all kinds of people from literally around the world.
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"had a very goos stay here, unfortunally there is no really feeling because the hostel is too big for that"
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,the bathroom smelled like pee. that was the only downside.
Afghanistan,Female,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,8,2,6,8,"the staff was really rude and disrespecful. but the hostel was good, but expensiveeee :s"
Taiwan,Female,18-24,6,4,6,8,6,6,6,6,water in bathroom isn't warm.it's very cold when i took shower!
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,6,10,6,10,6,10,"the charge for computer use is incredulous, as is making your wonderful staff stand all day (it's a hostel they should look comfortable and friendly, standing is stupid, it's not meant to be a formal uptight occasion)"
Jamaica,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the front desk staff was excellent. i wish you would extend the stay for three weeks. you are the best hostile in town. god bless!!!
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. best kitchen in a hostel ever, they have cheap food nights with bbq, pizza and pasta. loved the chill out area out the back. on the expensive  side but you get what you pay for"
USA,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,no complaints. this hostel has good tourist info and activities that make navigating la more bearable. santa monica pier and beach is a quick walk and you're practically in the third st. promenade for all the shopping. lots of street musicians. 30 min jog to venice beach. i definitely recommend staying here.
England,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,air conditioning would be good
SouthKorea,Male,31-40,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,specialized for santamonica!
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,santa monica was a great area to visit and hostelling international in santa monica was a great place to stay in.  i enjoyed the pasta night and the pub crawl they had on offer at the hostel.  i wish i had stayed at this hostel when i visited los angeles in october 2008 but fortunately fulfilled my promise to myself of staying here if i returned to los angeles.  i would definitely stay at this hostel if i returned to los angeles again.
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i thought the hostel atmosphere, facilities, location, cleanliness, how modern it looked were all amazing! they had so many added extras that made the stay so much nicer too.   the only improvement i would make would be to the mattresses, im quite a small person and every time i lay down i could feel the bed frame underneath me it was so thin. i dont think it was every bed though, and it definitely wouldnt put me oglff from staying here again."
England,Female,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel even if it is a little expensive. the location is fantastic, staff very kind and helpful. beds are comfortable and my roommates were great too. very respectful and quiet! we were lucky to be at the end if the corridor so no one walked past our room in the night, so peaceful sleeps for the whole stay! would definitely recommend this hostel!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6,2,8,10,6,6,2,8,extremely overpriced and absolutely no atmosphere. wouldn't stay here unless you are in a group before you arrive. 
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is an amazing hostel located in the heart of the city, just 1 or two minutes walk from 3rd street shopping and the same from the beach front. the hostel was very friendly with great common areas to meet other travellers, would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in santa monica!"
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"no aircon in the rooms so it gets extremely hot at night, and the wifi is pretty poor, but other than that, the location is amazing, you can lock all your valuables away in a locker using your own lock for added security! the staff were friendly but they didn't give me any information on where breakfast was held or about using the key cards, and for my first time in a hostel i was pretty confused until i manged to figure it out myself!"
USA,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,wish hostel had smaller rooms and/or privacy curtains around beds. one girl was sick and was always in bed. she kept closing the windows ( i kept opening them). sick people really should stay in a hotel or private room.
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,4,8,10,8,"the frozen mini bagels served during breakfast were kind of awkward to cut in half and toast; and they seem almost purposefully made to easily get stuck inside machines. where's the regular bread? also, there was no hot water to take a shower with at all on friday night to saturday morning. come on and step up your game you $50/night hostel!! otherwise, everything else was as good as expected."
Austria,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"this is an okay hostel, i just don't think the value for money is good. i payed over 50 dollars for one night (in an 8-bed-dorm), had to pay extra for storing my bag on the day i checked out, and i couldn't even use a computer for free. also my towel and linen had stains on them and sleeping on that matress felt like lying in a halfpipe."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,great hostel. they've thought of everything. big rooms good beds and a top location.
China,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i think this hostel is the best one i have ever stayed. the location is good, safe, and walk around to see seaside is just about a minute. they have enough vending machines for me who is really a lazy person to buy instant noodle and other stuff easily.  compare to the hollywood hostel , i prefer this one because the facility is also better and there is bigger space for people to relax.   i will definitely come back if i visit la again.  "
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.1,6,2,10,6,10,10,6,"it's a good hostel, a good chain (hi). you can have some troubles in the summer, cause is to hot there e dont have air cond., have a lot of people that can enter on the hostel without pay for it, a lot of people sleep on the ground of the dorm. had a good staff, a good atmosphere. the most strange thing was the hostel was hot like hell and when i tried took a shower just had a hot shower.. amazing.."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"this place is awesome. i've stayed here on several occasions and the staff is super friendly and welcoming. taylor caught me having a meltdown and was just the sweetest helping me calm down and getting me a great room. they work really hard to make this a great hostel and it shows. it's super safe, there's a mutual respect among the travellers. in the la area, there is no question that this is the best place to stay."
Germany,Male,31-40,8,8,10,8,6,10,6,8,"all in all a quite good hostel. i was in a 6-bed-dorm which offered quite a lot of space. unfortunarely the beds were quite short (with 1.83m i am not a giant). there was no airconditioning in the rooms, it was really hot (the fan only made a lot of noise but did not really cool down). nights are quite boring at that hostel - people communicate with their ipads and smartphones but not to each other. alcoholic drinks are not allowed, not even beer..."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,amazing location 
Canada,Female,25-30,6.9,4,10,10,8,6,4,6,"great location (10 min from the santa monica pier, and the third street promenade), free breakfast, wi-fi is working really well, but 10 beds in a room is getting really hot at night, not enough activities to meet people and no alcohols is allow in the hostel. "
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,4,8,8,best hostel in santa monica
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel in a wonderful location, close by for shopping and beach. staff incredibly helpful and facilities clean and pleasant. would definitely stay again next time i am in la! "
Germany,Female,18-24,8,6,10,10,6,8,8,8,loved the hostel with it's nice location in the heart of santa monica! just a few minutes to the beach.:) the only problem i had was the missing air conditioning. santa monica can get really hot at night so i could barely sleep in a room with 9 others and about 90 degrees fahrenheit... other than that i had a wonderful time and espeacially the breakfast and the many free activities like hiking or a la city tour were really nice!
Japan,Male,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,8,6,8,4,"very close to the beach and the shopping streets. very secured outside even at night.   the front entrance and the door to your room requires a card key to get opened. but you must be careful not to get things stolen just in case.  there are several public rooms that has sofas, computers, tvs. free wi-fi is provided throughout the building.  the shared bathrooms with showers were not that clean and comfortable. the dishes for your breakfast weren't either. dishes are all washed without soap!!"
Ireland,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"nice location, cool and clean hostel only the male showers on the 3rd floor is like going into a oven! "
USA,Male,41+,7.1,10,8,8,6,6,6,6,nice hostel
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"the first room we were in was awful, so tiny and hot with no bathroom. we were moved into a bigger room to be with the rest of our friends and it was the same priced room, but much bigger with its own bathroom. the pricing doesnt seem fair for the huge difference in the two rooms."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,would be nice if you could have a few drinks in the court yard otherwise pretty good
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"room was very very hot.  we had an 8 bed room which was very small for that many people.  washing was quite expensive (cost $1.25 each).  no parking at all for free, it was either an expensive one close by or seven blocks away for $5 a day.  they were always cleaning the bathrooms but they did them all at the same time so there was no where to pee.  it was social but there weren't many meals etc organised so you had to do it all yourself (not like a lot of the other hostels)."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,8,6,4,8,"this place was nice although not lively at all, i would definitely recommend staying down in venice beach where they have hostels on the beach. santa monica beach itself is nice although you can easily get there if you're in venice. this hostel has potential but i just couldn't see anyone staff or guests getting involved in any activities while i was there."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a f*$@:-) blast.... 
Finland,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"well located, nice &amp; clean rooms, good breakfast, good facilities in general."
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"loved the hostel, such a great area, just thought my room little small, they add one bunk, so we couldnt even have space to open the suitcases, but all the rest, can't complain! "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,10,10,10,6,8,6,4,great location for the price and easy toget to from the airport
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,4,10,"nice hostel and great location, but social areas are not great for mixing and luggage will only be held until 1pm the next day. great breakfast! "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, helpful staff, clean and comfortable."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"location, staff, beds, and facilities were amazing!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,6,8,10,good location. very nice hostel. something on every night. 
France,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the showers were cold on two of the three floors. but as california is on a bad drought, i guess it was better for everyone and not really bothering considering how hot it was!    apart from that and the price per night that was maybe a bit high (38 euros) this place is just awesome! such good vibes, super movie room, super reading room, super common room, great kitchen, awesome patio, very friendly staff, so many things organized every day that you couldn't be bored... i recommend this place!"
China,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,8,6,the shower water system was changing when i was there.... so the water was not stable all the time.... and the key card didn't work out couple of times.... i had to go to the counter redo it. i don't know if there has stuff to clean up the fridge. it looks really a mess and packed all the time. the value of this hostel i think is the great location. ten minutes walk to the beach and two mins walk to the downtown area.... 
Austria,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,8,6,6,4,we had cockroches in our room!!!! 
Canada,Female,25-30,8,8,10,10,4,8,8,8,"fantastic location and lots of free or cheap tours offered out of the hostel.  breakfast and dinners i had were good as well. the room was very hot with only a fan and no air conditioning, and the 3rd and 4th floors did not have any hot water in the showers."
Canada,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"terrific central location.close to the beach,  boardwalk, restaurants and shops.parking is only 14 dollars a day across the street.    a bit hot at night, but otherwise a terrific place w knowledgeable staff.  "

France,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"i was there for 5 days with a friend and we very much enjoyed our stay at h.i santa monica. the staff was always helpful, breakfast was good and the place was clean. the only bad thing i have to say is that showers was sometimes freezing cold or burning hot and there's no way of adjusting it yourself.  it's located 10min from the beach and one block from all the shops on the promenade and many buses run to downtown la so it's a very good hostel if you're here to visit but also relax!"
Austria,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,6,10,6,"great location, good facilities, and great atmosphere. washing room not the cleanest, and can be quite hot without aircon."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"one of the best hostels i've ever stayed at. the people were amazing, lounge areas huge and nice, but showers were either hot or cold, and no a/c on the 4th floor was iiiinteresting. but i would def. come back again if for anything the location!"
Norway,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"there was no air conditioning in the room, and with eight people in one room it gets pretty hot. couldn't sleep at all, and that kind of ruind my trip there.."
England,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,excellent hostel. even in a large dorm i got good sleep. went for a swim first thing in the sea as it's a 5-10 minute walk. really cool hostel
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,8,10,"the only small complaint that i have is that the quiet time rule was not followed. we had girls come in at 1 am and turn on lights, talk and pack suit cases."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,8,10,"  great breakfast, - room was extremely hot at night and the one working air conditioning only cooled one or two beds."
Germany,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"a nice place close to the beach but as all the hi hostels, it's not the best place for partying and drinking. still, the place was clean and i enjoyed my stay there."

"
China,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,more protein in the breakfast?
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,possibly the best hostel in the world!! period. 
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"this hostel was good. great location, big hostel, breakfast provided, and good value for money."
Brazil,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i had a great time in  santa monica and the hostel was definitely responsable for that. the location is noble. the best location i ever had in 20 hostels in all over the world.   but the hostel must to fix the water temperature, that was completely crazy and make better informations about distances to la. i lost my train in union staion because the desk said that it was 1 hour from santa monica. i spent 1 hour and 45 minutes.  in spite of that i intend to come back again to this hostel."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"awesome location, the rooms and bathrooms at the hostel are also super clean. free breakfast and whatnot in the morning was also a plus. the only downside would have to be how nobody talks to each other in this hostel! i really think there should be more of a social focus because apart from a few of the people in my room i got to know nobody. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,6,10,this hostel could be really cool if it wasn't alcohol free.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is fantastic! great location, everyone is really nice, wifi works well. only downside is that the bathrooms are very stuffy and 1 of the 4 showers was out of order for my entire stay... and that it is so expensive!"
Belgium,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,i loved the water bottle filler! haven't seen that anywhere but it's so convenient and green :)
Norway,Male,31-40,6.6,2,10,10,6,8,6,4,"way overpriced, especially with the hidden charge if your not a member. excellent location, only hostel around that area.  the bathroom really run down, not the best showers. common area was pretty nice."
Australia,Male,18-24,4.3,2,8,6,4,2,2,6,"staff were absolutely terrible, inattentive rude and aloof. the only atmosphere to speak of was the loud dingles out the front, no fun to be had anywhere else. never paid this much for a dorm bed, never again"
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,4,6,6,6,great location.  the staff are okay.  not the friendliest or most enthusiastic people ever but that's fine.  the only thing i really disliked was that the key i received to get into my room did not work.  i had to carry all my luggage up and down the stairs 2 or 3 times to keep going down to fix my key so i could get into the room.  the staff gave me attitude which i did not appreciate.  don't they understand the whole reason fokes pay for the hostel is to have access to the room?
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,8,6,i loved the area and the employees were awesome.   super friendly and just cool.   i liked the hostel a lot. i would go there always again.
Scotland,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"they where great hosts.  can't ask for more.  jd parked his car in a free parking spot to save it for our car.  my girlfriend and i where only staying one night but they offered us all their facilities, cereal, juice etc.  can't ask for much more."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,8,10,"i was satisfied from this hostel overall, but i think that the hostel's staffs weren't good. they had unconcerned me sometimes when i had check-in from the hostel. that is, when i couldn't the check-in for the hostel before 2 a.m, i wanted to keep my luggage at that time. and then, they seemed to be unconcerned me. anyway location was very great by locating the nearby santa monica beach."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,i liked it and would stay there again
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,8,10,10,"felt it was bit on the pricey end, but my friends and i wanted to stay near the beach so went for the little extra money. really nice place. very big hostel and has a more separate feel than other hostels i've been at where it has a more community feel. breakfast/kitchen area was large, but filled up quick. when we checked out we asked to keep our backpacks on hold before we left the city, but they only offered to keep them in lockers which we would've had to pay for."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best kept secret to see santa monica, california! i'm hoping to fly back for christmas! staff very friendly and knowledgeable. showers, bunks, rooms and interior design spacious and jazzy reflecting the international guests who travel there. there sun and air are so wonderful! i slept like a baby. first time in my life slept so soundly i was snoring. lol. no car necessary walking everywhere and buses run every 15 minutes! paradise, paradise and beaches! you will experience heaven! blessings!"
USA,Female,41+,6.3,4,6,8,4,8,8,6,"i was frustrated by the shower, which was only on-off with no adjustment for temperature, and it went from freezing cold to burning hot on a whim.  the beds were uncomfortable and i did not sleep well, also partly from noise.  all in all, i would not return to this hostel, but i am not against hostels in general."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"i was worried about staying in a hostel for the first time, but this was a really good experience.  i'm a female traveling alone so safety was a big deal to me.  i always felt secure.  the clientel was really good and they usually had multiple people at the front desk in case there was a problem."
Brazil,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,i enjoyed staying there! but i have a complain! the shower was too hot!
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,6,10,10,6,6,8,8,"overall, this hostel was perfect. it was a bit higher price than other hostels i've stayed at but the facilities are very nice. it is modern and clean, with many different activities. the kitchen is huge. if you're a light sleeper i would suggest earplugs. the city is very loud and all the windows are open so it's hard to get a long nights sleep."
England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,10,6,6,10,amazing location right next to the beach and shopping area. the kitchen is huge! great for cooking for yourself though unfortunately our food got stolen. the staff are alright but a bit miserable. beds are very comfy with a plug socket and night light. i'd stay there again. 
Romania,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,no smoking or drinking on the premises. a bit too strict i think
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"just a good typical american hostel, big but if your not scared to speak to people you will meet people"
England,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"helpful and friendly staff, ideally located for santa monica, good facilities, would both recommend and use again."
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,10,4,10,"good hostel, atmosphere not the best lot of wierd people but thats la really!"
Australia,Male,41+,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,generaly pretty good but toilet and showers very poor
Australia,Male,25-30,5.1,2,8,8,4,4,2,8,"a terrible hostel in a good location. there are lots of hidden fees at this hostel and there is no atmosphere whatsoever. in over 200 hostels i've seen, this is one of the worst. how this place gets a rating above 60% is beyond me. stay elsewhere."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"perfect location if you want to be near the beach, otherwise it's a journey into downtown la and hollywood. hostel has everything to offer, lots of lounge space, big kitchen and dining area. rooms are good with individual lighting, plug sockets and lockers. the bathrooms aren't ideal, showers run extremely hot or cold and not much privacy with the toilets, there's only one shared bathroom per floor. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,4,10,not a great place to meet people
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the hostel was in a good location, but if you didn`t have good room mates there would not have been a proper atmosphere. it was more of a hotel type hostel atmosphere (like most hi) rather than a proper backpackers."
Italy,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i chose the cheapest room, sharing with other 7 ladies and it was great. we had any problem, the room was really nice with a privet shower and toilet, and if they were busy, there was a huge bathroom in the same floor. people from the hi were nice all the time. location: excellent. the kitchen was also huge with everything to cook yourself. everything was very tidy. my experience was great."
Canada,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,i loved everything about it! 
France,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,6,10,"awesome location, very good value for money !!"
Italy,Male,31-40,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,8,6,"nice kind staff, good position, nice building.     big hostel, lots of people. i did not like they ask u 5 dollars to leave the luggage in the storage.    other thing: there were some crazy people in the hostel, and even if visitors complained about some weirdo, they did not do nothing, just move the visitor from a room to another one."
England,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,10,6,6,10,"breakfast was very poor, in fact it was disgusting which was a let down in comparison to the facilities."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great location, great facilities, very clean, has everything you need. not so much a ""party"" hostel, but the hostel runs pub crawls and there are lots and lots of bars within a short walk if you are looking for a party. if i was to go to santa monica again i would definitely be happy to stay in this hostel again. if i had one issue (which is a tiny one), my access card stopped working a few times. it was always fixed very very quickly, but slightly annoying."
Australia,Male,31-40,8,6,10,10,8,8,6,8,over all not a bad hostel however a little over priced i felt. 
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"this location is superb! practically across the street from the santa monica beach and the staff is great.  the only real downer is no reasonably priced overnight parking available anywhere in downtown santa monica. other than that, this is a fantastic place."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"hostel was in a beautiful location, about 5 minutes' walk from santa monica pier, which was great! i wish there were better options for parking if a guest is driving in (across the street at $14/night is too much if one is staying there for multiple nights, and the garage that's about a 10 minutes' walk away at $5/night is better but not the best option for solo females walking alone in the evening). also it'd've been nice if breakfast included some fresh fruit or eggs or something."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,6,10,10,6,6,6,4,bathrooms were gross and needed a real clean not a quick rinse that they got each day. showers were either too cold or too hot
Australia,Male,25-30,6,4,10,6,6,6,2,8,no vibe at all. boring experience. 
Denmark,Male,41+,8,6,8,8,10,8,6,10,"they need a ventilator in the mens bathroom, 3rd. floor."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"stayed in the 10 female dorm with my friend. the room was spacious and clean. large lockers were provided. there were power sockets and night lamp for each bed, which was highly convenient. location was within walking distance to the beach and the main strip. large parking station was across the road with reasonable day rates. simple breakfast of toast, cereal and yoghurt were provided. would stay here again."
Australia,Male,41+,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,great location. the free tours are a nice touch.
Norway,Female,31-40,8,8,10,10,8,6,6,8,"close to the beach and a really nice hostel with pool table, library, outdoor garden and more. breakfast good, beds good, kitchen good. staff nice except for a guy which seemed annoyed of me asking questions about transportation to the airport. i was amused by the fact that its a alcohol- free hostel, which is a nice break from some other hostels with a lot of drinking."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"overall an excellent hostel, with a location that cannot be beat. all of the staff were friendly and helpful. only negative were the showers which had some temperature issues (too hot!). otherwise a great stay."
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very helpful staff. great communal spaces. decent breakfast. clean rooms. two blocks from the beach, perfect. "
Argentina,Male,31-40,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,toilets don't flush correctly. the room was smelly.  
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,without a doubt i think it's a bit expensive and very poor breakfast
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,4,8,strange hostel. great staff and location but very strange vibe.  not sure about security.. we had a strange man knock on our door.
Denmark,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"the location of this hostel is amazing, and it has everything you need, almost! it does lack that getting-to-know-people-feel that most hostel have. its a very big hostel (260 beds i think) so i feels a bit more like a hotel, with shared room!  a big downside is that they cant garantee that you share a room with your own group, you could get in a situation where you are in seperate rooms! but its a good location for shopping and beach time!"
USA,Male,41+,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,8,8,thank you for an nice stay.
Canada,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel very close to many restaurants, stores and beach.  staff is convenient and safety place. however, first time i must pay for computer use in a hostel.  "
Norway,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"typical hi hostel. might need a little paint here and there but generally very clean. nice size rooms, comfy beds and lockers for everyone. excellent location between beach and shopping area in santa monica."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,8,10,"clean, nice place. bit expensive, you could probably also book a motel for that amount of money if you're traveling with someone else. excellent kitchen and very good location. quiet hostel at night"
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,breakfast could do with some varity. wifi was good across the hostel. lots of things to do.
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"this hostels best asset is it's location - in the heart of santa monica which is one of l.a's nicest areas. aside from that it's a pretty stock standard h.i hostel. excellent facilities, security etc but lacks atmosphere."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,8,2,8,not a place to party..no alcohol allowed in the hostel and people all on their phones ..no hostel interaction 
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,"clean, does the job and centraly located.  couldn't ask for better than that."
Argentina,Male,18-24,5.7,2,6,8,4,6,8,6,no one tells you that you have to pay extra fees. that is not fair.
Spain,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was great!
England,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, helpful staff, good they have tours and stuff organised, nice breakfast too."
Norway,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"if you are going to santa monica, this is the place to stay! the hostel is close to the beach as well as the city. planned to stay here for 2 nights, but ended up with staying for 8 nights. already miss santa monica and the hostel! met so many cool people at hi. if i should say something negative, it has to be the breakfast, wish it was more variety!   "
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,4,8,"nice hostel, clean with spacious rooms and great location. lacked atmosphere thought due to it's size... not many people seemed to be mingling and didn't seem to attract the crowd who wanted to meet others. i wouldn't stay here if i was traveling alone and hoping to meet others."
Finland,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"a good hostel, breakfast included which is nice. great location really close to the beach and the walking street in santa monica. had a great walking tour in venice beach, thanks ekin for that. lots of things happening, and if you participate to the organized tours it's easy to get to know people. otherwise i only got to know people in my own dorm."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome staff. did the best they could to give us suggestions on where to go for a night out. could we get the people in the courtyard to respect those who are sleeping in the am to keep the noise down? in the courtyard the noise bounces off the walls.
Denmark,Female,25-30,6.6,6,10,10,6,4,4,6,"really difficult to meet new people at this hostel! it the guests are not social at all.  seems that there a lot of group tours and people using it as a home, because they can't find anywhere else to live.. don't choose the 10 beds room. lived with a group of highschool girls and it was a mess."
England,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,solid hostel in classic north america mega hostel sense.
CzechRepublic,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel at a great place
Japan,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,6,10,8,バス停や海から近いし、治安も良いところなので、すごく気持ちよく過ごせました。10人部屋でしたが部屋も清潔で、鍵のつけられるロッカーもあり、wi-fiもきちんと繋がります。朝ごはんもキッチンがあるので、自分で買ったものと合わせれば、美味しく食べられると思います。またサンタモニカに行く機会があれば利用させて貰いたいです！
Italy,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,10,4,my bed was dirty and even the room. but very nice in the common rooms
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff was very accomodating and friendly, even with my late 11pm arrival!  location was great, and facilities were very good."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,2.9,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,this poor hostel is worst one ever in my entire life.  what i hate the most about here is that price and fraud.  they required extra fee when we arrived because we don't have the freaking membership. they should've discounted for the members rather than added extra fees for non members.  we stayed 1 night. and it was 42$ per one person even our room was 10people dorm. are you kidding? 42bucks for 10 person dorm?  also they provided a free pub crawl. it was fraud. nothing was for free.
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,really safe and friendly atmosphere. ideal if you're travelling alone. perfect location if you want to see santa monica and venice but maybe a bit far from some of the main attractions such a griffith park. i would recommend staying in more than one area in la as it's so big and there's so much to see!
USA,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"thanks for the wonderful and clean environment that is available for us away from home. i sincerely appreciate the opportunity extended. my main concern was the fact that, the room assigned housing 8 women was much too crowded and untidy. i also realized that, there is no screening of guests who are paired together in a room. that was surprising, indeed.  as i told the staff at the front desk, next time i will ask for a room with fewer women or, pay extra for a private room.  thanks for your time."
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,6,4,8,as a youth hostel you expecto to have certain atmosphere where you can meet other travelers. most of the people where too young (less than 18) or over 50. the staff makes no effort at organizing activities to meet others and they bearly can help you on finding something around the hostel
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,construction noise was horrible.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,8,8,i loved my stay at hi. santa monica is a fantastic place with constant public transport into la. the staff were excellent and always friendly. and the lockers in the rooms were big enough to fit my whole bag into.
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,good place to stay but that little bit too big to have a real atmosphere
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"really good hostel. i stayed in a 10 bed dorm which is kinda big, but it had its own toilet, shower, sink, and there were more of these on the floor in case you didn't want to wake your roommates up. it has a few nice chill out/lounge areas, one with massive tv and recliners which was cool. location is awesome if you want to be in that part of la, its minutes walk from santa monica pier and shopping area, but don't forget how big and hard to get around la is. close to lax, only $1 by bus."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,i absolutely loved this hostel it was by far the best i have stayed in. the location couldnt have been better. it also had lots of free activities which was great for when i ran out of cash. the only bit i would say needs improving is the showers.
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,highly recommended
England,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,6,8,"excellent facilities, especially water filters and chilled reading room, huge kitchen. and great location for the beach and shopping. staff very happy to help when you need. comfortable beds with personal lamplight. but as with many us hostels, rather a strange mix of people staying there across the age spectrum and including the homeless and incapacitated for example. so not too much atmosphere."
Netherlands,Female,41+,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,10,6,not the hostels fault but... i shared a room for 2 days with someone that had a severe bout of the flu - so she told me as i was leaving! is there a policy about sharing a room when you are unwell?    staff were fantastic. i recommend the guided walks.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,10,"very good stay, close to everything. "
Australia,Couple,41+,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,pity about the shower was our of order and had to used another floor otherwise great stay
Australia,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"a great location, well set up hostel with lots of different spaces &amp; plenty of room. staff were very helpful &amp; information provided for activities was excellent with directions &amp; maps.  breakfast was good with tea &amp; coffee provided all day. big kitchen &amp; eating areas.  an elevator was an added plus especially with luggage."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,i had to use restrooms from other floors and there were a lot of locks missing for the locker. other than that the facilities and services were clean and good.
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this is the best hostel i ever stayed. i've already stayed there for 3 times. there are just two things i would like to comment that i didn't like much: once there were 5 guys in my room and one was really noisy and i couldn't sleep all night. another thing is that i was driving a car and had to pay for parking overnight. if i stayed in a hotel with parking lot, i would probally pay the same amount, and stay in a private room."
India,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,no fan or a/c in the rooms.  automatic vending m/c's we're not working. doors should be provided for bathrooms instead of cloth screens.
China,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, facility so great. nice breakfast"
Japan,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"if you wanna stay at quiet and clean place, i really recommend this hostel.  location is perfect close to the beach and shopping area."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"only stayed for 1 night so didn't get to really experience the hostel. was a great location in santa monica, rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable. showers were 'too hot' on our floor so had to shower on the floor below. slight inconvenience but not the end of the world. would stay again if i was in la"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,10,8,10,4,2,10,"great location if you like shopping and the beach. very expensive, but very safe area. staff were good but not very helpful. "
SouthKorea,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really liked this hostel, although i stayed there only one night. if only i had more time! it's in great location. close to the beach and shopping area and so on. the staff was really nice and helpful. they tried to help me with problems, even though it's not related to the hostel. it was really helpful! there are a lot of activities going on all the time. so you can join them and enjoy! "
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,10,8,location was awesome! hostel was clean and staff was always available to help. had a blast on the pub crawl and you just can't beat the location. i highly recommend.
Cambodia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i love this place, i would recommend it to anyone. except, breakfast are not included much of the varieties beside bread."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"great hostel with awesome people. the location is perfect and you can reach everything within 10minutes walking distance. the hostel just had some serious water problems during my stay, water did not work showers too hot or too cold… but i think thats fixed now =)   all in all my stay was great and i really enjoyed my time"
India,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,6,10,10,you will love it if you like stay near beach..  had great time staying there..
Argentina,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,just perfect
China,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really good.
Belgium,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,nice hostel in a good neigbourhood/in the city centre of santa monica. hosts all kind of people/ages. felt very welcome !
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,8,8,"fabulous location. the breakfast was extremely poor and there is not much choice however, there are lots of places to eat nearby. clean rooms and bathrooms with towels and hairdryers provided. would definitely stay again."
Sweden,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff is extremely friendly, professional and efficient.  breakfast is always ready promptly at 7:30 and the coffee pots always full with fresh brew.  and by staff i surely don't only mean the front desk, but rather even the cleaning and kitchen staff are always smiling and keeping everything in good order.  this is absolutely the finest hostel for miles and/or kilometers around!  oh, and i just love the events such as the pub crawl, comedy shows and more!"
England,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,"this hostel has loads of facilities like laundry room, tv room, big kitchen, dining room. a home away from home. nice breakfast. quiet areas if you need them.  it was almost too big in that it felt more like a hotel.  bad points are the communal showers and toilets had little privacy.  another bad thing is the male only dorms. where's the fun in that?  santa monica is ok, especially if you like yoga, apparently. nice cinema."
HongKong,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best location in santa monica, but they keep cancelling tours from hostel such as tour to getty centre, so that i needed to go there by myelf, but that was still a good experience for me!!!"
France,Female,18-24,5.1,2,6,8,6,8,2,4,"i used to choose hostel international, but honestly it was the worst hostel ever! i felt really not safe and it was noisy with all big trucks next to the window at 6.30am! they put a boy in our room, i was surprise to find him when i woke up..i was in another hostel in hollywood downtown, was cheaper and really better! "
Argentina,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,the showers should be improved
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,10,8,"it's slower in winter than in summer, but the space is nice and the location is amazing.  wish there were a few more casual in house activities -- fooseball table, soft dart board, a few weights or some such thing -- the library is nice and the lounges well styled, but there was a lack of things to do inside.  the big tv in the 2nd floor hall always seemed set on something pretty silly, and people were sitting in front of it but not actually watching (set a time for an evening movie maybe?)"
Algeria,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,best experience ever!! 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"a great hostel, located very close to santa monica beach, and in the heart of the santa monica business district. lots of restaurants close-by and a really good atmosphere going on in the hostel itself. good breakfast. only downfall is having to pay for storage on departure day - not cool when you've paid for a night's accommodation."
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a great time lyn and i met some nice people and great locstion snd friendly staff.
USA,Female,41+,6.9,8,6,10,6,8,6,4,"the showers on floor 4 were scalding. there was no way to regulate temperature - they were either on or off. fresh towels daily would also be much more sanitary, since there was no way to properly dry the ones we were given. you could put a towel hamper in the bathroom.      i also think that children should not be allowed to stay. someone was allowing their young child to run -- literally -- shrieking up and down the corridors and common areas, which was an unacceptable nuisance."
England,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,10,6,6,8,"this hostel is in a fantastic location but it felt a bit institutional... there wasn't much atmosphere despite it having a great kitchen, dining room etc.  the window in the girls dorm wouldn't shut which made it cold at night and it was a long walk to the bathroom. all in all though, it's good value for santa monica."
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"my only complaint about the hostel is that you don't see much joy, chat... no stimulation to a social relationship inside there, like places that you can eat and drink for a happy hour etc. it is a very serious mood. if it was a younger weather, would be perfect! that's it! i hope i was helpful... thanks!"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome modern place with big kitchen area and lounges.
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,8,6,very nice staff. felt safe. everyone pleasant and helpful. thankyou.
China,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great locatiuon with great staff. i have no complaints. if there is something, maybe the showe ficility can be improved as it really lack ot privacy."
Spain,Male,25-30,6.3,2,6,10,8,6,6,6,"did you see the prices of this hostel? it is the most expensive hostel i have never been! in the prices showed in internet is not included taxes, and not included 3 dollars/ per night if you are not a member of hostelling international. if you want to stay the weekend, 2 nights in this hostel you might pay 100 $ for a single bed in a dorm of 8 or  10 people!  can you imagine it?  if paid 50 $ per night and in my room were sleeping 8 people, how  much is the profit of the hostel?"
Netherlands,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"ended up staying for 3 nights, very centrally located, good parkings near, near beach and 3rd str promonade. i would definately stay here again!"
CzechRepublic,Male,31-40,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,"no, own parking, i came at night, to find free spot was impossible there."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great experience staying at the hostel, rooms were good size, clean &amp; staff were helpful. the atmosphere was good &amp; i really liked the fact it wasn't a party atmophere but there were still activities you could join in on.    only complaint is thst the mattress was pretty uncomfortable!"
Switzerland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it is vety near to the beach
Ireland,Male,25-30,6.6,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,other occupants of room were untidy and had food in room. rooms should be checked daily by staff.
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"everything was nice: excellent location, the hostal is clean, the only thing that really upset me, was  my roomates, they were really loud. plus, my keys was always uncharging but the staff was very compreheensive about it, so it's ok."
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,rooms have enough space! top location of the hostel!
Canada,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"large lockers in the room are good!  the washrooms were large and clean, but the shower wasn't really hot.  the breakfast was pretty good, and it was warm and welcoming.  the location was excellent, and it felt really safe."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"stayed here 18 years ago, and then again last weekend. first class hostel across the board!"
China,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"that's a very good  hostel, especially the location that is so close to the santa monica beach. if you are afraid of where is kind of far away from holywood, disneyland~ don't worry, there are some tour agencies providing all kinds of tours. actually santa monica is a wonderful attraction, don't forget to take a sunset tour on the beach if you hit there, that will be fantastic."
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,6,8,8,"kind of expensive for a hostel, however its a nice place."
Canada,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,there could be a few more couches in the hallways or more lounge areas to hang out in.
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,2,10,10,8,8,10,6,best hostel coffee ever! well worth $100 for a two-night stay (sarcasm).
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place. it fit my needs perfectly. i highly recommend it!
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location of the hostel is very good, especially for going to the beach, the staff was very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice, the only thing is that it is very expensive for a hostel even though it is a very nice one."
Argentina,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,great hostel and great location.
China,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"on block away from the beach and a lot of bars and restaurants around, nice place."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is amazing! located so close to the beach, many bars, pubs and restaurants. the hostel itself is sooo clean, so many areas to relax in such as a cinema, computer lounge and outdoor patio!  bedrooms are small, but so comfortable and functional eg lockers."
Australia,Female,31-40,6.3,4,8,10,6,6,2,8,after checking out they will only let you leave your luggage in their storage for 2 hours - if it is even over by 15 mins certain members of staff will tell you to put it in the 24hr lockers. some of the front desk staff are not helpful or even friendly when you approach them. if you want to mingle and meet travellers this is not the place to stay - santa monica itself is great though just don't expect much from this place socially.
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"the kitchen could be better with more staff! there was for example just 2 or 3 kitchen kniffs or no free herbs or salt/pepper. the rest was great! friendly staff,clean and a good location!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great hostel in a great location. i always stay in hollywood when visit la. not anymore. the bathroom is clean, bedroom , it is so great to have that extra pillow. the tv room is great as well as kitchen and dining room. one of the best hostels i've stayed in, and i have stayed in many hostels."
USA,Male,31-40,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,staff there was rude and incompetent. mainly the manager some rude hispanic woman and the overnight guy who was super rude. nasty place! nasty staff! 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great clean hostel near the beach, great location and lots to do!"

Poland,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent value for money.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for (and it's an expensive area in general). the beds are so comfortable, personal light and plug points, good lockers in room, lots of floor space for bags. good security with key cards at front door and room doors, in the best part of la - clean, good shopping, one block from the beach/pier. great breakfast provided, cereal, bagels, bread, yoghurt, tea/coffee/juice. the showers were cold both times i had one during my stay! maybe just bad timing?"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,need some improvements in the common areas to make it better for socializing. maybe the layout of the furniture.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location, minutes walk from great shopping, the peir &amp; beach. all other places accessiable by bus, train etc. walking distance to pubs, restaurants &amp; bars. hostel offered a lot of activities &amp; for nights people wanted to stay in there was a tv room with a flat screen &amp; couches. had a very homely, comfy feel. rooms large &amp; spacious with a clean, hot shower. staff were friendly as well."
Bulgaria,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i have ever been! it is not party/social kind of place but it is nice and younare still able to meet some lovely people. definitely will recommend!
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,6,6,6,6,the best location.
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"a greatly equipped hostel. beach, food and shops all around. good grocery store down the road. though the place lacks atmosphere. not enough travellers to chat to. but i did find some cool people around and the facilities made up for it. though no a/c is annoying considering the price. also no alcohol or smoking anywhere on site was annoying as it forced allot of people away. the patio area was really nice, but since no alcohol or smoking could be done there it wasn't used for socialising."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,10,6,fantastic place to meet new people and amazing location for the beach:) 
Turkey,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,10,8,6,8,very good facilities and hygiene but too big to get new friends.
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location and breakfast is one of the best i've ever had in a hostel. great place to stay!
France,Female,25-30,8,8,10,10,6,6,8,8,"great hostel, location and cleanin good.  only thing i didn't like was the extra cost for bag storage form more than 2 hours when checking out.. also should have an airport shuttle a bit more accommodating"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,great location by the beach. good facilities and very clean. thanks very much.
Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel is better than an hotel. great great great place to stay. the best hostel i've ever been.
Canada,Female,31-40,3.1,2,4,6,2,4,2,2,"really dirty, and service is bad."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i would defiantly recommended location was the best some of my friends stayed in other areas in la and they were very jealous of my location. so much yummy food, great shops, live music and the beach is all at your doorstep. the pub crawl was fun and the common areas very cool felt like a hotel. i stayed in a 10bed door female very spacious. defiantly stay again and recommend to friends......"
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i´ve stayed in!
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"this hostel is really close to the mall, pier and good eating spots! had a really nice communal sitting area/courtyard which was nice. breakfast was just your basics but still hit the spot :) the only downfall would be one particular male staff member who wasn't very friendly but overall it was a good stay!"
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"really good hostel. very clean. good breakfast, wi-fi for free available. but no aircon in the room. can get a bit hot at night.  every bed has ist own light and powerplug. thats very good.  nice common areas with different things to do! tv-room, internet-room, reading-room......"
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,the hostel was really well run including being very lean and hospitable. however on the day i arrived i got told i couldnt stay in my room for 2 nights (as requested) and had to check out again the next day and then check in again the next day which was annoying seeing as i ha to pack all of my things etc and then reenter the hotel and put it in the storage facilities when people in the room were staying for longer periods of time. other than that the hostel was amazing and value for money.
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i checked in 10pm (22:00) and they had overbooked. they had no more beds left, so they set up 2 make shift beds for another guy "
England,Female,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,8,10,"stayed at this hostel for six days during that six days, at no matter what time of the day, i did not once have even a lukewarm shower, the water was so cold that this, i believe, was the reason why i ended up with bad flu. i don't know if this was because i was situated on the fourth floor. despite this i felt the hostel was obviously in a very good location, the staff at the front staff were adequate, activities they provided were excellent and the housekeeping staff were the real stars!"
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8,10,10,10,8,6,8,4,"easy people, near the beach!"
Lithuania,Female,25-30,6.3,4,8,8,8,2,8,6,"they added about 6$ per night on top of the hostelworld sum of taxes/fees. some of the staff were terrible and unfriendly. the rooms were not very well cleaned. otherwise, it's an ok place in an ok location. avoid the comedy night!"
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,4,10,8,8,4,4,6,"pros: beautiful building, really easy to get to the beach and decent breakfast spread.     cons: however, the staff acts like you're bothering them if you ask questions, the 'activities' aren't that great and there's not a lot of personality. and it's a dry hostel! definitely did not meet any new people at this hostel -- it's a very quiet, keep to yourself vibe."
Serbia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,8,4,8,6,"you should give a receipt to customers when they check out, like in all other hotels."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,had a great time there! metso many nice people!
Brazil,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location! could have activities for the guests - not having it makes really hard to meet other travelers because the majority of them are traveling in groups.great room &amp; they offer breakfast! i don't like the fact that you can not consume alcoholic beverage at the hostel.but overall is a great place &amp; i love santa monica!
Thailand,Female,18-24,8,6,10,8,8,8,10,6,"there are some sand in my bed ,,that's only one thing im complaining,,mostly are excellent!"
NorthernIreland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"staff were very helpful, printing out directions, keeping the suitcases in the storage room etc"
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"very close to the pier and 3rd street mall. clean and secure. it was a little hard for me to find, but was nice"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel best in los angeles by far, clean, tidy, great location, friendly and helpful staff will defiantly be returning its just a shame you cant stay any longer than 2 weeks!!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,6,10,"great hostel but lacked in atmosphere as i am a young single traveller. was too big to try and talk to people and everyone minds their own business. great hostel otherwise, perhaps better for groups. realllyyy expensive for a hostel though."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,8,10,"being the only hostel in santa monica there is not much option but we were happy with the quality of beds, common areas and cleanliness. position is great. felt more like a hotel that other hostels as there is not a fun/energetic/friendly vibe."
Ireland,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"the negatives: wi fi dropped out a lot and wasn't available on all floors, the staff were efficient but not very friendly. on the plus side: good location, good breakfast included (coffee, juice, bagels, toast, peanut butter, jam, two cereals), organised tours to the getty centre/comedy nights/pub crawls, individual light and socket at each bed :)"
France,Female,25-30,6.3,4,8,10,8,6,6,2,"the women's bathroom (4th flloor) was dirty during our stay (3 nights), and some of the showers clogged."
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i liked it there, it was close to the beach and downtown! also rooms were very clean and it was good that they had more then just peanutbutter and jelly for breakfast, when we had questions the staff was nice and helped us."
Russia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"great location, very close to santa monica pier and promenade, bus stops and travel agency. personnel was very nice and helpful. the shower was always a mess, many people and water everywhere.  room key didn't work well."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,keep up the good work!
France,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"this hostel is located in santa monica not in los angeles. you need 45 minutes to reach hollywood boolevard and 1 hour la downtown in bus. it is well located in santa monica not in la. do not be surprised. but the hostel is great. awesome breakfast included. clean. 2 blocks from the beach and the pear. good and friendly staff. santa monica is nice. i recommend this hostel. but if you want to visit la, there is hostel better located close downtown."
Sweden,Female,31-40,8.3,10,8,10,6,8,8,8,"location, location, location "
France,Female,25-30,6,4,4,10,8,6,4,6,"this hostel hasn't a good ambiance, too big it's more an hotel than a hostel! we stole our food, and we were not the only one!! taff a little bit rude... i was disappointed happily the location is great."
China,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,8,6,6,8,"this hostel is huge. not much atmosphere, felt very much like a dorm room. location is great though."
Egypt,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"a great place to stay, i wish i could had stayed for a longer duration!!!"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"we loved  this hi so much we revisited for the last few days of our trip! the location is brilliant, just two blocks from the beach which you can walk, cycle or rollerblade etc to venice beach and a 10 sec walk to third street promenade which is a thriving hub of activity. the amenities are also great, good sized communal kitchen and dining. the outdoor area was lovely,great atmosphere and this is where we spent most of our time. breakfast was good, basic but clean rooms, great staff,"
Argentina,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,8,10,"really liked my stayed there. the location is unbeatable! you will have a great time there. make sure you have a hostelling card orl else it is quite convenient to get one. it costs around u$d28 and you may get one night free if eve stayng in other hostel and if you dont get it or already have it they charge an etra u$d3 per night...so, it is worth it. only thing that i did not like is that they do not charge what hostelworld states as balance due on arrival..of course they charge more, why?"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,8,2,6,8,4,6,10,one of your staff members we complained to didn't not help or fix the situation that was caused by a very aggressive and un stable women being allowed into our dorm! it was a ten person dorm and we complained about this spasific person at 11.00am and all nine of us got turned away and then it took a turn for the worst at 2.00am when the police had to be called! i would like my money back because to be out in that situation when you're scared for your own life and so are nine other!
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,a nice place to stay in santa monica
Germany,Female,41+,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"although i was in a room with 10 beds, it was very quiet."
Turkey,Female,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,there is no ac in the room. i think this is problem. but the other things was awesome. i liked it a lot.
USA,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is the third time i have stayed in the h.i. la/santa monica hostel.  i enjoy the large hotel feel of the hostel, their excellent breakfasts, and their organized events.  the breakfasts are the best i've seen in any hostel with a lot more than just peanut butter, jam, and toast.  i went to the acting class, two comedy nights,  the pub crawl, and the club hop that was sponsored by the hostel.   in all four of these events, i had fun and met new friends from other countries."
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,8,6,4,8,"the location is great, being close to the beach, the promenade, and public buses. i felt safe going out at night, but despite the security door the homeless do get in. there was a very large and very crazy homeless man running throughout the halls at about 3 in the morning banging on all the doors until security was called. breakfast is ""meh"" but free, lockers are great but bring a lock, no ac, and common areas need to be reorganized to get people to socialize more. everyone's on their laptop."
Ireland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,this is a really nice and convenient hostel. it needs better air conditioning in the rooms but the cleanliness and good lockers make up for that. 
Wales,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,the hostel is in a great safe location in santa monica. the rooms are clean and have a large locker for your suitcase (mine was pretty big and just about fitted) though you do need your own padlock. there is something on every night so it's quite a sociable place and the staff are really helpful about extra activities or if you need directions or recommendations.  there are fans in the room but no air con which is the only downside as it can get pretty warm! 
Belgium,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"rather expensive, but definitely worth it. great location (very close to the beach, the pier, the restaurants and bars), very helpful and friendly staff, great facilities. pool table, patio, good kitchen. excellent beds with personal lamps and sockets in spacious, clean rooms. highly recommended!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"i don't normally go in for expensive chain hostels, but in this case convenience and cleanliness won out for me and i was really happy with my decision, despite the expenses. personality is pretty run of the mill, and it was kind of hard to meet people (not the best if you want a party hostel probably), but it was safe, clean, well-controlled and super close to the beach. there's $5 overnight parking 15 min walk away that wasn't bad at all, either, and made my life much easier."
England,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"nice place to sleep, poor for meeting people."
Argentina,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,6,8,had a great time there. perfect location. close to the pier and beach and shopping.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,10,8,6,8,"really nice hostel and great location. atmosphere was not that great and it was hard to meet people even in a 10 bed room. there a no drinking or smoking policy, which reduces the social side of the hostel and meeting new people."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel - clean, feels safe, in a good area, so close to the beach, really easy to find. $5 pasta meals on tuesday and free breakfasts are great. staff were friendly, approachable, helpful and had a sense of humour."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,6,10,"the hostel has a great location, close to the beach, 3rd st promenade and buses to take you further. the rooms were clean and spacious. the kitchen is also really big and well equipped.   it is a big hostel though, and as such doesn't really have that community feel of a small hostel. everyone is there doing their own thing. the no alcohol rule also means that you can't sit around and have a beer and chat with other guests (which is only a personal preference!). overall, a great hostel."
Brazil,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"it was a very good stay. very big hostel , good facilities , good security and great location , 1 block from the beach  , almost on the promenade , it's where all happens in santa monica. i was in a 6 people dorm  wich has enough space. only weird things is that it's a dry hostel and doesn't have a  bar so i lacked a bit of atmosphere. the staff was a bit "" cold"" too compared to other hi staffs ...well i guess it's the la way maybe. i had a very good stay."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed our stay here, i normally stay in venice beach so this was my first stay in santa monica, the hostel is huge, everything is new they have fantastic facilities, basically everything you want in a hostel and a great breakfast."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,10,8,"really lovely hostel, great location, clean. all you need from a hostel."
Italy,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,hi santa monica is the best hostel for travellers visiting la. santa monica is the best area to stay and i can't think of a better location or hostel to stay than this.
Norway,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice and clean hostel, good location, friendly and helpful staff, tons of different things to do and easy access. would definitely stay here again if i come back."
Sweden,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,nice breakfast!
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was  awesome!!!! actually it was my first experience to stay at hostel however i  felt that i ve never booked the hostel like this in my life  kk
England,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,entrance to hostel a bit hidden by travel shop besides it. ( the  guy in the shop said it always happens that people booked with hi go into shop first)  besides this the reception was run efficiently as it was busy when i checked in.all the information about the hostel is given in writing ( prepacks) on arrival. the place was kept clean. breakfast was adequate for my needs.  location of hostel is fantastic for the beach ( 2 minut)  .it was quiete overnight and people of all ages mingled well
BritishVirginIslands,Female,18-24,4.9,4,6,8,4,6,2,4,"this hostel was awful for atmosphere. there's nowhere to gather outside like a patio to hang out on. no atmosphere mostly because of the no alcohol rule but also because of the hostel being so unwelcoming, there's nowhere u really get to chill and meet people. the comedy show was incredibly bad and the staff should remember to tell you which bed you've been assigned up one checkin."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,10,6,8,"there was too many people in a room, maybe thats why room has humid atmosphere."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,2 things would help make it all above average.  need more bathrooms.  don't hide the dish washing soap.  people are washing their dishes without using soap at breakfast.
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,6.9,8,8,10,8,4,6,4,"location is perfect for all things santa monica. found the beds very short and narrow and rooms had very little space to put your baggage. one staff member was unhappy to store our bags for 4 hours, saying normally they would charge for anything over 2 hours, i've never encountered that in a hostel before. large school group was annoying but obviously a regular part of hi business. free comedy comedy night was a great initiative. "
USA,Male,41+,8.9,10,10,10,10,8,6,8,"great stay and will stay the again when i visit la. one worker there, elise, really tried hard to get me a cab so i could go see my friend's play on the other side of town.  great service all around.    as for the environment, my roommates were pretty cool for the most part."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,4,10,"excellent facilities with quiet common rooms, tv room, computer room, etc.  it is a bit of a party hostel, plus they let groups of school children stay there.  the kids were constantly running around unsupervised and shouting at each other and generally being a nuisance, which ruined the feel of the place."
England,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"my second time here and have to say the location is fab.  staff are helpful and free breakfast is good.  however i had a dorm room over looking the street and main entrance which was very very noisy.  other than this rooms were clean, bathrooms clean and hostel is comfortable.  i'd stay again for sure when in la.  "
Netherlands,Female,31-40,7.1,6,10,8,6,6,8,6,"stayed here for the second time, because it is one of the best options in la/santa monica. beds are quite comfy (compared to other hostels) and the atmosphere is mostly good to excellent.    i didn't like that using the computers is sooo expensive, considering that the stays are already expensive. also the price mentioned in hostelworld is excluding taxes and if you're not a hi member you will have to pay extra too, so the stay is even more expensive than at first look."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,make sure the cards work because it kind of frustrating to have to swipe your card repeatedly when you've gone to the bathroom late at night.     the shared showers need better drainage.
Argentina,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"the hostel, the staff, facilities and location is great! the only thing i have to mention is te poor wi-fi connection, too many people trying to use it and didn't work!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"i had a very pleasant stay at the hostel, i'd say it's above an average hostel. it was mainly clean and is located in a very good area! i'm sure i will be back some time in the future! the beach and shopping area are only one block away each and there is a tourist information center right next door. i never felt helpless or lost! the money was definitely worth it!"
Canada,Female,31-40,7.1,2,10,10,10,8,4,6,"if you don't mind paying a lot to sleep in a hostel that feels like an army camp this is the place to stay. the rooms are simple, clean and the bathroom is shared by about 50 others. it has all the required facilities but you must pay for everything additional. computers, lockers etc, all extra."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"nice clean hostel, good common areas and great breakfast. location couldn't be much better!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,staff was very accommodating to our needs!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,it was an awesome hostel in a great location. minutes walk to sm pier and 3rd street promenade! only downfall was the bathroom floors were a bit disgusting so i just wore things in the shower. also some events that they had on were cancelled so that was a little irritating when it came to planning your time. but would definitely recommend it to anyone!
Scotland,Male,41+,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,i had to alter my arrangements several times due to meeting up with friends  and the staff were very good at altering my bookings and took it in there stride  as though it was an everyday event  also they put me in a small room where ever possible which was preferable as a  more senior citizen and not into noise or late night partying  very impressed
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and always saw someone cleaning which made me feel a lot more comfortable staying at h.i!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was clean, confortable, the staffs were educate and very nice. i really had a great time there. and also the location is great."
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was better than expected, though the door card lost it's charge twice in the middle of the night i had to have it re charged"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"awesome location! just 2 blocks to the pier and one block to the main shopping street. lockers in the room were awesome, big enough for suitcases with shelving for belongings. shared bathroom facilities weren't too great, virtually no privacy for showering. some staff were great and some notsomuch. i'd stay there again though for the location. "
France,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i spent a very good stay here, it's clean, big locker in the room, several common rooms, patio, very big kitchen. location is just perfect (one block to the beach). there is a real good breakfast (yogurt, fruit juice, cereals, toasts, jam, muffins, tea, coffee...). in the other hand you have to pay 3$ per night if you don't have the membership card and wifi doesn't work in the room."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,4,10,a good hostel in a great location near the beach! the only thing letting it down was the lack of atmosphere and vibe. if your not in a group and want somewhere with more of a vibe i suggest somewhere else. 
Philippines,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i fell in love with hi hostel the first day i stayed there. the facilities are clean and well-maintained. i had to book an extra night and apply for membership. they had a lot of activities to make your stay more special. i'm staying at their san francisco branch the following week - just because of the awesome experience i had.
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,6,10,10,10,8,10,cheaper 'after checkout' security lockers would be an improvement.
Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"brilliant location! very secure overnight parking facilites close-by. lots of shops in the area. close to the beach and the boardwalk. for a hostel, it was clean enough. the wi-fi could be a little bit better. the breakfast isn't special but on par with other hostels i have stayed at. the staff were friendly and helpful. lockers in the rooms, bring your own lock! not the cheapest hostel but for the location it is good value for money! would come again!"
France,Female,31-40,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,10,6,it should be better with more bathrooms. 
Belgium,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,8,8,4,4,8,"beautiful youth hostel but poor ambiance... no evening activities or bad shows with poor artists...  i didn't talked to anyone, this is the first time in a youth hostel, and i travelled a lot in youth hostels all over the world for years..."
Switzerland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,no wlan in rooms! :(
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,great place. no party and the y allow kids of 14 years to stay.   staff is cool except for fergie.    location is excellent.
India,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"i enjoyed my stay at this hostel. the staff were friendly and met some really good guys! look forwarding to visiting again. i highly recommend this hostel to anyone who is seeking accommodation at santa monica, the location is perfect!"
China,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,things are very good. just 2 things to be pointed out: wifi is only available on the 1st and 2nd floor which is not very convenient. people went to bar crawls organised by the hostel come back later but did not keep noise down which is not very nice to the people already sleeping.
USA,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"another reviewer mentioned that there was no hot water in the showers - there is hot water, but it takes about 5 minutes to get hot, so turn on the water, then brush your teeth, pee etc and by the time you're done the water will be hot.     also, one of my roommates stole my bag of toiletries, so remember to lock things up even if it's cheap shampoo and toothpaste. i don't blame the hostel for the theft."
Sweden,MixedGroup,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,the family rooms are great and maybe you should have more of them. they are hard to book online - can that be fixed?
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,only stayed briefly. good to have 24hr staff and access. had smaller room of 4 which was also nice and quiet.    i travel a lot for business and stay in hotels but as a quick stopover leisure trip this seemed a much better option than a cheap motel/hotel.
USA,Female,25-30,4.9,2,8,6,2,4,6,6,wifi really bad
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,a very well set up hostel in a great location.  would highly recommend it to anyone.
Norway,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"had a great stay here, the location is wonderful!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,great clean hostel with friendly organised staff.
Taiwan,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,good hostel
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,in a great part of santa monica. it is literally a block from the beach. parking will cost you anywhere from $5 a day for uncovered parking and $14 a day for garage parking. lots of yoga places around the hostel. weekdays not in the summer does not have a great night life (everything closes at midnight) but the location makes up for the lack of night life. i would go back for sure.
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"the hostel was in a great location with plenty of activities and stuff to do. the rooms were probably the best ive ever stayed in. kitchen area was great. garden was lovely. the only downers were the wifi connection was a bit tempremental, the tv didn't get fixed for 3 days and at one point a homeless guy managed to get into the hostel which was uncomfortable because he wasn't escorted out the whole time i was eating my dinner. overall i would still definately recommend the hostel."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"we had a fantastic time at hi santa monica. the staff were all very nice when we came in and the beds were already made up when we got to our room. the whole hostel was very clean and the little lobby with the fireplace was super comfortable! we went on the bar crawl that night with the hostel and didn't know what to expect, but had a ton of fun. we even made a couple of friends visiting from brazil who rode with us the next day to tour hollywood. i would definitely recommend this hostel!"
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,love staying here when i'm in la.  can't beat the price and the staff is always very helpful.
Mexico,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excelente place to stay... i loved it :)
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,shower water temp was unpredictable.
NewZealand,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,10,8,2,10,the hostel is too big - it feels impersonal like a hotel. and you can't drink there so there's not a lot of socializing.
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,6,8,10,4,8,4,6,"the wifi connection in this hostel is very very bad, almost to the point where you don't have access to internet when staying there. other than that everything was pretty good. showers and toilets pretty clean. character and atmosphere pretty cool, staff pretty friendly.   honestly an average hostel in a good location."
Malaysia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i love the community sense of the hostel, there are free nightly and daily events for hostel guests."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location - only one street away from the beach as well as being close to shops, grocery stores, buses to the airport and buses into town. exceptionally clean rooms, bathrooms and kitchen. daily breakfast was adequate. helpful staff."
USA,Female,41+,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,clean well maintained friendly.  needs more electrical hookups. needs wick in rooms.
Scotland,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"a great hostel, i'll definitely be back. really reminded me of the spirit of what youth hostels can and should be about. the staff seem really happy there and did everything they could to help. good breakfasts too. thanks guys!"
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,4,10,"a good, safe, located and clean hostel, the staff are very helpful and friendly, theo helped me with directions even though he was very busy. i myself didn't like this hostel as much as others as because of it's size it's very hard to meet people and doesn't have much character, but if your tavelling in a group this is fine. the tours that they put on in the morning are very good and the breakfast is one of the best that i've seen in hostels."
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,it was clean and quiet during my stay.
France,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,very nice thank you
England,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,6,10,"great location in santa monica - staff gave you loads of info about the area, and they run really good tours. the only things that let it down were that there's no bar and unfortunately the showers were only ever lukewarm, which is a bit unpleasant when it's cold outside! overall though, i'd definitely recommend this hostel."
Canada,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"theo was very helpful! wished there were more toilet stalls in washroom on our floor. the pub crawl was boring. the location is close to everything! the info centre very helpful...needed to get to ontario, ca and they provided me with everything."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"lovely place to stay. great free breakfast. the ban on alcohol was a bit strange though, i didn't expect that, however it created a good vibe in the hostel. really clean hostel, lovely staff, great location but if you want to get into hollywood the public transport takes aggges!"
England,Male,,8.6,10,10,10,8,8,4,10,"brilliant location-sandwiched between shopping promenade and the beach. the hostel was clean and the rooms well set out with the feeling of having enough space. a key card is required to get through reception and also into your room, medium sized locker included. the atmosphere is calm, with many people doing their own thing in the lounge areas. the kitchen could use more equipment. cost was more than expected when non-member fee and occupancy tax added(about $4 per night)."
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel with good breakfast, free walking tours to venice beach and la downtown . entertsinment at night  had all the faqcilities ,security and was so good i have booked to return. i have recommended the hostel to others"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,6,6,10,"considering how much we paid for this hostel, we were a little disappointed. it has a great location and the facilities are  pretty clean. we were booked into a 6 bed dorm and it was so small there was no where to put our stuff ( the dorm was full). we moved to an 8 bed dorm and it was better. the rooms need more powerpoints. overall it was fine, just lacked atmosphere."
Chile,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i would like to see fruits in the breakfast, enough with apples and bananas, and may be not to canceled the activities because a rain the day before but to change it.    otherwise i loved the spirit of the hostel."
Taiwan,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,well i hope there will be wifi in the rooms in the future
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,8,2,4,10,"the hostel itself is clean, and the kitchen and bathroom facilities are great.    meanwhile, i have never encountered such rude and unhelpful staff. no smiles, no please, no thank you. in addition, things weren't explained to use properly and we were dissappointed in how we were treated.    the wifi situation is very poor considering the amount of money being paid at the hostel.   they should have a look at how well st christopher's hostels are run."
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,"enjoyed my time here, great location close to the beach, shops, bars etc! staff were helpful, breakfast was average but was free so no complaints! the wifi is frustrating as there is many to choose from but not all work great! bathrooms were clean and the rooms were spacious!"
Philippines,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"amazing location, good facilities like the tv room and the laundry room and the dining area...no complaints except that the wifi can be a bit spotty sometimes- that's about it :)"
Canada,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,10,8,6,2,6,"good hostel, but it extremely lacks the atmosphere. the cleaning needs to improve - bathrooms seems to be dirty and are not sweeped/mopped properly. only one hair dryer worked while the rest were broken . overall, the location is great and is not far from the beach and pier and the breakfast was good. there is one particular staff that have made one dinner night and the pub crawl a dissapointment. not going to comment or name, but i feel he wasn't professional with his job."
Canada,Male,41+,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"i am concernd about the high cost of stayng at the sm hostel in dorms during the summer.  $50/night is expensive, contravening the mandate that hostels be affordable to encourage traveling, promoting understanding.  i am concerned about the recent decision to not allow people living in los angles county to stay at the santa monica hostel.  the county is vast, taking 5-6 hours to travel from one end to the other by public transportation.  those living in la county travel in internationally too."
Italy,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,5.7,6,8,8,4,4,4,6,"the internet connection works only in the common areas, not in the rooms, and it's very unstable. the whole atmosphere was kind of unwelcoming, the staff seemed to hate their job and i felt uncomfortable hanging around at the hostel. they didn't promote the activities nor had a clue about public transportation when i asked them, so i pretty much had to plan everything on my own."
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"i enjoyed my stay at the hostel. it provideded more extras than most motels/hotels.  i appreciated there being a separate lounge for the tv, electronic communications, and socializing.  i loved that there was a free iron and board in the laundry room.  the best part was at the end of the day being able to get a hot drink in the kitchen or fix a snack or supper there!"
Japan,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,"i have stayed several hostels in la, and this is one of better one so far. most other hostels are pretty noisy all night and much more dirty than this hostel. the only problem is that wifi here only works on the first floor near the kitchen area. it often does not work everywhere, and i saw some people went to starbucks near by to connect to the internet."
China,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,6,8,"didn't really enjoy my stay for several reasons:  1. not enough plugs in the room, only two in 6 bed room, had to go down to the reading room and charge my phone at midnight.  2. only given a blanket/towel serve as substitute for comforter, had to put all my coats on top of it to stay warm at night.  3. short breakfast time and very limited choices with limited seats at dining area.  4. a lot of elders and other folks that are not youths staying there. not a good atmosphere for students."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,fantastic place to stay.
Denmark,Male,31-40,7.4,4,10,8,6,8,10,6,"too expensive, the price was 36$ including tax, but 25$ would have been better.  i paid 20$ at the hostel on hollywood blvd."
England,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,probably one of the best hostels in north american annive staying in a lot.
Scotland,Male,18-24,4,2,2,10,4,2,2,6,"had my computer stolen from bed in the the second it took for me to get to the toilet and back after waking up from a nap. front desk were unhelpful and told me all i could do was fill out an incident report and walk the fifteen minutes to the police station. on arriving there i met another guest from the hostel who had also had something stolen, police then let slip that this happens all the time there and that it should be avoided. didn't even give me a free pass for their internet, shocking!!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"i stayed for one night at the h.i. hostel but me and my friends  had a really good time.the hostel is really big therefore there is a big kitchen, dinning- and a living room for everybody,also the  have a movie room.the  breakfast was excellent,bagels,toast,cereals...  our room was small but still okay for 4 people,it was clean and the sheets were good.the bathroom was big,clean and had hairdryers!!!i  the only thing that wasn´t so good,it was loud in the hallway for our room because oft the echo."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was the best i've stayed in! great location and every facility you could possibly need. had a great time would definitely recommend!!!

Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"great hostel. very handy location. right in downtown, close to the shops and the beach. free breakfast was good, bagels and cereals. biggest hostel kitchen i've been in. dorms were nice and clean with fresh bedsheets and towels. would definitely recommend this hostel. thank you."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,10,6,6,10,"the kittchen was laking many kitchen utensiles like a water boiler etc  the schweres were not so good, the water didnt get very hot   the hair dryers wenn out while using it"

Netherlands,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"clean, not noisy, and well located near to beautiful santa monica beach. if you want to visit downtown la, you'd better stay in a hostel which is located there, since it is &gt;1h by bus to downtown la. great if you want a quiet stay at a clean well located hostel. if you are looking for a fun place, i would recommend going to another place."
Portugal,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"outstanding location - seconds away from santa monica beach. a bike rental just around the corner (colorado/2nd st.) is a good choice to move around and reach venice, hermosa, ... shuttle to lax ($15) stops just in front. decent cleaning, big kitchen, good comfort and helpful staff."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,"hostel is in a good part of santa monica, close to the beach and everything else you need. rooms are ridiculously hot, good luck to you if you manage to get a good night's sleep. staff are really nice and professional. wifi is pretty tempermental and breakfast is fairly average"
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,"if i had to make one suggestion, it would be to get more ventilation in the bathrooms as they were constantly steamy, however overall great location and great value. no major complaints."
China,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,8,6,carpet in the dormitory is old and a bit dirty  no lock on female bathroom
India,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wonderful experience :) loved our stay there.
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,10,6,8,"a little on the pricey side of hostels but worth it, only 2 blocks from santa monica beach. perfect location. if you only want to visit s.monica, this hostel is for you, if you want to see other sights in l.a. it might not be - it takes forever to go anywhere else using public transit.nice lounges with wifi, good, clean kitchen and beds were okay. lockers were a bit small, couldn't fit in my backpack. very nice staff members, made me smile every morning even though i'm not a morning person!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"great hostel! very well located... security was also found there! would stay there again,"
NewZealand,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"what a lovely, comfortable, clean place, and so i am planning to return to it."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great location, clean and secure. defo a great place to stay if you want to do beaches and be away from hollywood"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel feels like life at ucla! all the peanut &amp; jelly sandwiches you can eat, plus healthy cheese on wheat, oj, a bowl of corn flakes, two kinds of yoghurt atop ladles of sliced peaches and hot coffee at the ready.  the two palatial reading rooms are ivy league, the internet facilities are at graduate level and the tv room when i visited featured a tutorial in foreign &amp; domestic policy taught by joe biden. total ""tuition"" is only $30 and a place to sleep is included!"
Argentina,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,10,8,6,6,8,"its like a hotel and this isnt always good. it has a lot of acommodation, a good tv room and a ""place to read"". but in fact, people never speaks between each others and making friends became a very hard work. i'd rather staying in a smoller hostel.  the staff isnt too helpful and wifi doesnt work at rooms. at the end, guess are always at the share rooms just to be on internet."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,the doors slamming are a problem and the construction across the street made sleeping with ear plugs imperative.
SouthKorea,Female,,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"the hostel looks pretty new. very clean, good atmosphere and safety. location is close to beach, when it's sunset, that was beautiful. but about an hour far from downtown, if you have lots of plan for downtown, you'd have hard time for trasit (especailly, you don't have a car, l.a. public transit schedules are very unoften.)"
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the santa monica hi hostel, is the best hostel i have ever stayed in.    loved it, thanx, lisa"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,felt really safe in this hostel and it was so clean! location is amazing!
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,7.4,4,10,8,6,6,8,10,it was more expensive than other hostels in us.  i can't use wi-fi in my room(3th floor) and sometimes in whole hostel..  but it is really near from santa monica beach and shopping center.  it was clean.
Sweden,Female,25-30,6.9,8,8,8,6,6,4,8,"really good value for money, but overall i didn't think the stay felt that great - big kitchen with fluroecent lights that felt  like a school cafeteria . the cortyard was great but since it closed 11pm there wasn't really any space left to hang out after that that felt relaxed. the location was great though and rooms were ok, just need a bit of athmosphere and personality."
Brazil,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very good in every services and the best location!
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,8,free breakfast nice vibes and beautiful outdoor courtyard. has awesome tv area and good wifi... fun acticites with free dinner 3 times a week. and the volenteers are super fun especially the guy who does poker night :)
Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"perfect location, just one minute from the beach and third street promenade. nice and clean. can totally recommend to stay there. no better option in santa monica!!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location, close to beach/shops/restaurants. i only stayed one night, but breakfast/kitchen facilities were good. water bottle filler was handy. nice courtyard area."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"this hostel is very big, hundreds of people are staying there. but it never feels too busy. there are very nice activities organised in order to meet ppl, such as the pub crawl. plus, the location is definitly the best, 2 blocks from santa monica beach. i highly recommend it."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"wifi was pretty dodgy, and there was only one type of cereal for breakfast. other than that it was a nice hostel and the facilities were really good."
England,Female,18-24,6,4,8,10,4,4,4,8,"for people who don't travel with high tech equipment like computers, there isn't great value for money re. computers."
Taiwan,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,it's a nice choice to stay. i hope i can get a chance to visit u.s.  next time i will spend my vocation completing a whole one
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,6,10,"really great location, staff always seemed to be clean and very spacious room....negatives - a little expensive, so big and so many people atmosphere lacks a bit, but overall would recommend."
Belgium,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"plug socket at the bed would be convenient. better wifi. the room was a little bit smelly with 6 occupants.  the bread was really foamy. these are my only remarks., they are minor."
Brazil,Male,31-40,7.7,8,10,10,8,4,6,8,"unfortunately it seems to be a common sense for this hostel, the staff is really not friendly. they are not exactly rude but do not expect much more than a really cold hotel approach.  the place looks more like a hotel than a hostel, people do not interact to each other as a hostel. if you are travelling alone or need to cook it is a good deal as you will save money, otherwise a normal hotel can be more comfort."
England,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,great hostel. very secure. can get to the beach within 5 minutes. lovely staff members.
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"this hostel was great- the location is perfect! plenty to see and do around, plus the trips the hostel put on were good too. everything you need in the hostel, couldn't of asked for more really (although the rooms were incredibly hot at night)"
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,10,6,4,"really nice hostel, great location just a little bit more clean. my bed was full with hairs =s"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i liked how they let you borrow beach towels, that was really great! i think i was supposed to get a bath towel when i first got there too but they must've forgot or something. the serving ladies and the fresh lemonade are very nice too."
Ireland,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,6,8,6,6,8,"the staff at this hostel were a little hit and miss - the person on desk when i first arrived was unhelpful and couldn't tell me basic travel information about the area. it's worth bearing in mind that it takes about an hour on the bus to get to la, it's in downtown santa monica, which is nice enough, but not la. it's a bit of a shame that there weren't really any activities going on to attempt to get guests to mingle, but in terms of building and facilities, it's a great place to be."
Germany,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,like most hi hostels the wifi at the hi  santa monika is stuck in 1980. you can only connect on the bottom floor and then chances are you won't be able to do much of anything as the bandwidth is appalling. so much of modern backpacking relies on the internet for trip planning - get with the future hi and upgrade your wifi
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay. caters for all.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,6,8,"staff were helpful and friendly, rooms and bathrooms were kept quite clean which was nice but the dorms did get very hot during the day and at night made it difficult to have a restful sleep, especially with 8 people in one room"
England,Female,31-40,4.6,4,6,8,4,2,2,6,"i found the staff rather unhelpful and unfriendly, they seemed to want to chat to each other more than the people who were staying.  it was also very unsociable, nearly every person was on their laptop or other electronic device.  the room i was in was incredibly noisy, i think they emptied the bins outside it every morning. the other 3 people who were in my room were students and it was horrendous! their stuff was all over the room the would talk on the phone and have the large light on till 2.3o"
Canada,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"super friendly staff, great location, and very comfortable place to stay.  the large courtyard is a particularly nice aspect of it. the only (minor) negative is that while the hostel has ac, the rooms themselves do not."
Russia,Male,18-24,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,"everything was good. but they want to improve services there are ways to do it, e.g. extend wi-fi coverage to the 3rd and 4th floors, because it's not very comfortable to go downstairs every time when you need an internet access. also announcements about tours and local event should be placed more prominently."
Russia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,wifi can be a lot better.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,great place to stay in la!!
Canada,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,8,4,"i had an incredibly uncomfortable stay because the room and upstairs were so hot. i couldn't sleep at night because i kept on waking up sweating, it was really horrible. when i was in the room all i wanted to do was get out of the room because i couldn't handle the heat. i also found the washroom to be quite dirty, particularly the shower area. i feel there is so much potential in this hostel as the downstairs is nice, but the heat ruined my stay."
Portugal,Female,31-40,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the room was facing some air conditioning units on the roof and the noise was impossible, internet only works sometimes on the 1st and 2nd floors and i was on the 4th. apart from that all is good, breakfast is great, it is clean and safe, location is excellent and the staff was good too."
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,great place to stay! so much fun. the pubcrawl good be improved though..
Wales,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,the staff were so friendly and helpful
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"i had high expectations as this is a hi hostel. i was disappointed. there was no air con, so the room got stuffy and it was too got to sleep. wifi service was really bad and hardly ever worked. they only store luggage for 2 hours, then you have to pay. no privacy in the showers. it lacked atmosphere that a lot of other hostels have.  on the other hand, the kitchen facilities are excellent, it's a great location, breakfast is good."
England,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"staff amazing, great place to stay whatever your age, only drawback no air conditioning in the bedrooms so they became uncomfortably hot, fans are not enough for a santa monica summer."
Germany,Male,31-40,5.7,6,6,10,4,6,4,4,toilet should be cleaner. pc not working and rooms poor equipped. atmosphere unpersonal
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"it is ver close to the beautiful beaches of los angeles, a lot of facilities to hang around, huge kitchen but no spices for cooking."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay at the hostel! they had night time activities which make it really good for single travlers to meet new people in a happy, safe and fun environment."
Spain,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"i really loved to stay in hi los angeles-santa monica, the staff were super kind, and helped us a lot. maybe the breakfast was a little bit poor.. i mean in variety!! value for money is absolutely perfect, and the situation incredible!!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wifi areas throughtout the building.
England,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,8,4,10,"typical hostel international - very clean and efficient but totally lacking in atmosphere or character. very dim attempt to create a sociable environment. despite this, free breakfast was fantastic and the facilities were very good and also well connected to other areas of l.a. the internet usage fee is not cool."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,nice hostel close to the beach :-)
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great hostel in a crappy, soulless city. staff are friendly and unpretentious, facilities are fantastic (lots of communal space indoors and outdoors with places to get away from the crowd if you just want to chill out for a bit), huge fully-equipped stainless-steel industrial kitchen and great location in the only part of l.a. any sane person would want to stay. would not hesitate to recommend this hostel provided being able to drink wherever you stay isn't a priority for you."
Russia,Female,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,6,8,"the location of the hostel is perfect. staff is ok but not very welcoming. some look tired and dont even look at you when you come up to the reception(not all,one girl was very nice) . hostel is in a very good condition, everything looks new and even stylish. as for the atmosphere its a typical hostel: many people, noisy, loud young people.  the biggest con though is that 10 people in the dorm is too much, doesnt feel comfortable at all."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,safe and clean hostel and nice staff ;) doing the laundry wasn´t easy though cause many washing maschines didn´t work.. but all in all it´s a good hostel ;)
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,very conveniently located and a great deal
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel, no complaints. parking is terribly expensive - would be good if hostel struck a deal &amp; came up with a solution."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"could have done with a few more showers and some more ventilation in the room. it was so stiflingly hot! breakfast was amazing however, as was the location."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel has everything you need!!  clean shower, nice rooms and lobby and it's huge. definetely is in the best location and i'd stay again for sure if i come back to santa monica.    cons: - a/c was not working very well  - i was having breakfast and one of the guys from the staff was starting to move everything to a different desk, i didn't realize they were ending the breakfast time....but what i think was rude was his speech ""breakfast is over, i need to close ""  - it's all about how you talk"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"stayed here for a night at the start and end of my trip, as my home flights go through la. had been to santa monica before, so chose it for the relaxing feel - beach, walking and biking around. wished i stayed longer so that i could have taken advantage of the hostel's tour to the getty museum.  met nice people, the staff were friendly, and the facilities adequate. the showers weren't the cleanest the second time around, but think that was only because i beat the cleaners to it.  would stay again"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,good stuff. pay for the location.
USA,Female,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,8,6,6,6,"i thought the hostel was well kept and clean and the location was great, but i thought it was a bit overpriced for a hostel."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"good location, good hostel. there is a cosy small open yard to relax, nice touch."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,fantastic stay would of been good if there was a bar like the one in san francisco. however still had a great stay the staff was very helpful and welcoming.  thank you
Egypt,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"loved the hostel, very clean, very organized. its location is beyond amazing so close to restaurants and the famous 3rd st. promenade thats full of flavor, lots of shopping and amc in case you wanted to see a movie. its a block away from the famous santa monica pier &amp; the beach.. just loved it.  the only thing that i didnt like is the fact that the rooms had no a/c, only a fan &amp; it was super hot. also didnt like the idea of a shared bathroom with the entire floor."
England,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"pros-location in santa monica, common areas, kitchen and breakfast and paid dinners  cons-the people staying there are young and inconsiderate in the dorms.  quiet policy-whats the point in having this if its not enforced?  please highlight to guests and suggest if you are leaving before 8am to pack bags the night before.  every morning i was woken up as early as 6am with people turning lights on and rustling bags for up to 45 mins. not cool.  internet was very slow."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel was one of the best that i have ever stayed in.  i would recommend this to anyone that was staying in the snata monica area
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"very nice hostel with perfect location next to the sea side. free towels for the beach, free internet and good/cheap washing machines. living rooms are clean and spacious. perfect to relax. one of the best hostel i've ever been."
Azerbaijan,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,good location. clean. great atmosphere. very good value for money. recomended
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i got two sets of 6 insect bites each, closely spaced; one on my arm, one on my back, possibly bed bugs, or fleas.  rooms 210, and 204, bed 3 in both rooms."
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"one of the best hostels i've stayed infraestructure wise. the facilities are top of the notch and the common areas are great for hanging around. if you don't have a car, santa monica is the place to stay!"
Germany,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,had a great time there
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"had a great stay at the hi, excellent facilities and location. breakfast was good value. thought the price was a little high compared to other hi. overall great stay."
Italy,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great place to stay. didnt have any problems. really good location, staff available the whole time. clean. reallygood"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.9,4,8,10,6,6,6,8,"the hostel was just fine, and the location is amazing. it was the only hostel we could find that was so close to the beach. however i felt like the hostel takes advantage of its location by charging a comparatively high price for an average service. the hostel was clean and safe, but not as nice as any of the (much cheaper) hostels we stayed in elsewhere. overall, i have no real complaints about the hostel, just that the value for money is not great."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location. clean, friendly, good vibe. the beach is so close you can practically spit on it."
Ireland,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, in a fantastic location. wish i had stayed longer in santa monica than in hollywood."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"i was in santa monica at the start and end of my trip; i chose the area because it is more laid back - i wanted something easy going and when i feel like going for a walk, prefer the beach rather than downtown. also, close to the airport and to the getty museum.  my four bed dorm was fine, clean, and had a lot of space for bags. as all hi hostels, it is very big so it may have an impersonal feel. will stay again."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay! will recommend it for sure!
Germany,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,definitely the best address in if you want to stay in santa monica!
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"i enjoyed my stay at hi santa monica, everything was very clean and the staff was friendly, they helped when i had question about the area or how to get around for sigtseeing :)    it was quiet after the ""quiet time"" and there is space to relax and just come down after a day of walking around!    the beach is really close, just 5 minutes of walking and on 3rd street as a promenade and a mall with great stores, there is also santa monica pier, a great place to walk around :)"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"i think the acitivities for the night could be more diverse and made more attractive, for example you could offer parties!"
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great place met some really cool people, very clean, no bar but the location makes up for that would recomend to anyone"
Portugal,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"excellent hostel, perfect location near sta monica pier and 3rd street!    if you come to sta monica u must stay in this hostel!"
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,4,8,10,"it's a good hostel on a good location, but the staff don't give you a hostel feeling, but more like the feeling that you  get when have to pick something up at the goverment. the people make the difference!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,4,10,10,6,"the location in santa monica is great - the staff are really helpful, and if you stay there, definitely do the pub crawl - its a lot of fun. however, the wifi is touchy when you're on the second floor, and also the showers have absolutely no water pressure. they seem pretty unclean also."
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,10,6,"it was great , location is cool a block from the beach !"
Germany,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,6,8,"big hostel, clean and friendly staff but a bit anonymous. internet is free but painfully slow. rooms are small compared to the spacious entrance hall and common areas. nice location though - a minute away from santa monica pier and just a 30minute walk along the beach to venice."
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,8,6,i would recommend the workers do a better job on cleaning the room and bathrooms
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"this was the first hostel that i have stayed at in the united states, and it was an excellent experience. they have a ton of activities for you to do, but i was most impressed with the overall atmosphere and character of the hostel. it was very clean, very pleasing to look at, and everyone was very kind and helpful. i'd definitely come back!"
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place was awesome!  great facilities, good free internet, super helpful staff and everything i could have needed in a hostel and a perfect location too.  would definitely recommend!"
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,location wonderful! staff helpful &amp; cheerful.  breakfast great.  concerns: 1. hostel movie being played loudly until 11:30 pm in a room outside and below our (courtyard) window.  why would the hostel break its own quiet hours?!  2. bunk-bed mate talking on cell phone in the middle of the night - recommend some more reminders about cell phone etiquette &amp;/or cell-phone-free room options. 3. the dishwashing system isn't very sanitary; doesn't the law in ca require a bleach dip?  why not institute?
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,6,6,6,10,it's a good ho;stel overrall...  but in huge hostels it's easy to not know anyone.  the shower in my room need some regulation cause it was cooling me alive.  breakfast good.  security good.  almost no plugs in the room.  but... ok...
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"staff are very helpful and friendly except for the gentleman who works the night shift. he's very rude, sharp and seems genuinely uninterested in helping guests. the hostel is very clean, and the location couldn't be better. the guys who were in charge of the bar crawl, were excellent! the only downside of the hostel is that alcohol is prohibited. this means that guests can not socialise together, instead they have to go to bars."
Canada,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,10,8,"perfect location great for shopping and the beach, made lots of friends, throughly enjoyed my stay"
Canada,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,just got my iphone stolen.. dont go there
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,"very big hostel, feels like a hotel. additional to what you have to pay according to hostelworld, you pay about 5 dollars tax per night. use of anything costs money as well (internet 2 dollars per 20 min, washingmachine 3 dollars etc). it feels a bit impersonal and expensive, especially after arriving from south america. the location, security and touristinfo are really good."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,10,4,8,10,the wifi was very poor. for travelers that wish to book flights or hotels/hostels whilst on the wifi... forget it! walk to a cafe to get good wifi. not impressed considering the money we pay!
Australia,Female,,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"if you want to party then this is the hostel to come to! organised cheap nights out, 3 meals a day, short walk to the beach, excellent vibe. if you want a quiet stay and to cook your own food, this is not the place to come."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, felt very safe at this hostel, will def stay here again if l'm ever in santa monica."
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,the room was fine and the beds comfortable but the showers were disgusting.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location but rooms are a bit small
Croatia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the hostel was great and it's location even better!! santa monica has a lot going on, and it's a really nice part of la. i was traveling alone and felt really safe in that area! the only thing that could be better are the showers-the pressure is pretty bad and they should get darker curtains. other than that-perfect!!"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great! super clean and professional. great location and the wednesday night bar crawl was fun!! only negative comment is the price, too expensive for a hostel!"
England,Male,25-30,5.4,6,8,6,6,2,2,8,"the staff directed me to the wrong bus stop for a bus that i needed to catch to meet a friend. the 'no drink' rule is a joke. i spent the evening in the courtyard. there were some french guys drinking and being obnoxious. they were also smoking marijuana and it was blowing in my face. i went to complain, there was no-one on the front desk. - unacceptable. you need to have a manned desk at all times. you have a 'best staff member' competition? none of them for me, they should all be disqualified."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,the internet connection is terrible. surely this can be fixed so that it actualy works alot better than it does.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,4,8,10,6,6,6,10,very expensive!! by the time you add tax and non-membership fees you're looking at about $50 p/n. but if you want to stay in santa monica this is the only hostel around. my advice is that if you are travelling with someone stay in a cheap hotel instead because it will be cheaper. free breakfast was average (cornflakes &amp; small bagels) and they had lots of activities on display which looked good but they cancelled half of them. is very clean but way to expensive for the budget traveller.
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"5 star hostel! very clean, huge kitchen to cook in, excellent breakfast included, right in the heart of santa monica shopping area.   lots of common seating areas and organised activities. this was my second stay and iwill definitely be back."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,10,8,8,10,"bit steep at $40 a night, but that's la. santa monica is a great area to stay and hi is a nice clean hostel. not very social though."
Colombia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this was my first time ever staying at a hostel and it was fantastic. excellent staff, comfy beds, and very safe. no complaints at all."
Turkey,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the hostel was amazing.  it's a place that u can go there with ur family.  so clean and quite. with friendly stuff just 2 blocks away from the  beach and city centre
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay to avoid the hustle &amp; bustle of downtown la and enjoy the relaxed beach lifestyle that santa monica offers. easy to book discounted tours from the shop next door and the $1 bus fare on the 'big blue bus'#3 from lax is a winner (about 40 min ride to just near the hostel). staff were friendly and helpful and the hostel had different activities on each day/night of the week. there are homeless people that frequent the outside of the hostel, but i would not let this put you off."
Austria,Female,41+,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"only hot shower,too hot water"
Austria,Female,18-24,8,4,10,10,6,10,10,6,"very good place to stay, just not very cheap. plus the beds were not comfortable at all. apart from that the hostel is amazing."
Finland,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,10,6,6,8,"the location in santa monica is excellent and facilities ok, but the hostel itself lacks character. it is more hotel like and the atmosphere is like that; no so much random chats with other than your room mates and people seem a bit distant. and not allowing to drink any alcohol in hostel premises is just stupid."
Brazil,Male,18-24,8,8,8,6,6,10,8,10,"my only problem with the hostel was that the room was too bright, the curtains don't block the sun rays."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,10,8,really awesome hostel!
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,it felt like a hotel. amazing!
USA,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,"tax is 14% and also there is a $3 charge each night you stay if you're not a ih member.  staff was helpful and it's a nice place.  really not much to do in santa monica though, and public transit to main la sites is about 30-45 min."
Scotland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i've stayed at. comfy beds and generous breakfast.
NewZealand,Female,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"lovely hostel, clean, great location in lovely santa monica, staff very helpful and good fun also, my only problem was with the beds, very thin mattress most hostels have deccent mattress so this was a bit disappointing also the $5 fee for day storage again most hostels this is free...other than these 2 issues everything was great...."
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,among a lot of hostel i've stayed this one was by far the best! it is highly recommended.
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"this was a really lovely place to stay. it wasn't a party hostel by any means, though people could go on pub crawls and explore the local night-life as they felt like it. i could be alone, but was able to meet people, go on tours, and enjoy the atmosphere of having so many friendly faces around."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had the best time from check in to check out! the location is unbeatable, and the activities were such a ball. the staff was very friendly and the hostel was a great environment to get to know new people."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is awesome, if your in socal this is the hostel to stay at. great location 5 minute walk to santa monica beach &amp; pier, the staff and fellow travellers are friendly. cheers."
Ireland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,4,10,amazingly good location and reasonable value for money. kind of soulless or bland but utterly functional. staff respond to emails superquick which is great!
Italy,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the hostel was very nice and clean. a plus was definitely the free internet and the free printing. maybe they should organize the breakfast a bit better because there weren't many places to sit. also sometime the toilet paper was missing from the bathroom, but other than that it was a very pleasant stay!"
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"one of the nicest hostels i've stayed in.  close to the beach, shopping, public transportation.  tours available next door.   internet cafe onsite, tv room, places to hang out and talk.   nice to have breakfast everymorning.  staff was friendly and helpful."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,6,8,10,"enjoyed my stay, though they were putting in new floors during my stay so couldnt access my room during the day apart from that i wouldnt have a bad word to say about it.  santa monica rocks!!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,"my only complaint is about internet. it could be fast and more reliable... the rest was excelent! graet people, grat place!"
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"love this place and very  nice, but it  at the time i was staying there people were less social or outgoing."
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,8,8,8,8,6,hello everything was fine.
England,Female,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,6,10,10,10,"really liked this hostel, great location and as a lone traveler it was really easy to meet people. lots of organised tours and activities...only down side are the showers and the fact you can only get wifi on the 1st and 2nd floors! along with the $3 extra a night for not being a member! would gladly stay here again"
England,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,8,2,6,8,"the hostel was nice and in a good location. the problem was the staff, particularly the guy who worked the night shift. it took him 30 minutes to check us in and then put us in separate rooms, even though i had booked 4 months in advance. also we were charged significantly more than was on our hostel world receipt.    i would not stay here again solely because of the staff and their bad attitude."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i've stayed in. no question.
Australia,Male,31-40,5.4,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,"not pleased, after cancelling my stay it got charged to my credit card.   didn't stay there so can't comment on other aspects obviously but this leaves a fairly bad impression and i'll take my business elsewhere in future."
France,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,8,8,8,10,"hostel very nice, lively and people available. rooms and bathrooms cleans, despite a lot of people who come in. breakfast good and various choices."
Australia,Female,31-40,7.4,6,10,10,4,6,6,10,"you have to pay for locker storage when you check out. they don't place the internet passed on the walls everywhere so people always asking eachother and most of the toilets don't flush properly. great location near beach/shopping area, clean, spacious rooms, lots of activities and drinking ban is good."
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"this was my first time staying in a hostel and it was great! perfect location, not too far from the pier and the promenade. stayed here for my spring break and i would definitely stay here again!!"
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,8,6,6,6,"great location, breakfast a plus."
China,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,6,10,10,a great place with perfect location.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location, you couldn't get closer to the beach if you tried!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at this hostel, probably one of the best on my extended holiday around the world. very clean and good facilities. they also provide cheap dinners throughout the week and organise pub crawls, poker nights etc. i really liked the location - very close to the beach, the pier, heaps of shops and restaurants. you need to get a bus or shuttle to downtown la/hollywood, but they're just day trips anyway, don't want to stay there."
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"this is a great hostel, very well located, safe and very clean and organized! good breakfast too. my only two complains go to the showers (they were usually cold) and the internet connection, that is very slow! but i would definitely recommend it! although if you are looking for a party hostel, this is not the case... alcohol is not allowed in its premisses and the pub crawl they organized was not very good. besides, it does not provide much opportunity for meeting new people."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,8,4,4,8,staff seem flat and are not overly keen to go out of their way. i approached the desk to ask for some scissors and they claimed they didn't have any. i'm sure their was a pair of scissors somewhere in their office. facilities are good but it lacks atmosphere. it is probably more family friendly then fun for young people. and you pay top dollar for it. i would probably stay in venice beach next time!!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was a clean and friendly place.  everything was clean and there was plenty of everything needed.  not all hostels are as nice as this one.  and it's right near the beach just like was promised!!
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,10,8,4,i enjoyed the stay.  the staff and location were excellent.   just a couple of minutes walk to the beach and also to the shopping area on 3rd.  my only complaint was that the shower room was a rather unclean and i cut my finger on one of the hooks in the shower room.  it had a very sharp edge.
Scotland,Male,41+,7.1,8,6,8,6,6,8,8,my only  complaint was that very little was done to enforce quiet hours. during the time i was there there was extremely loud outrageous conduct on two occassions where i had reason to complain about girls running shreiking along corridors at 3am.this was not an isolated incident as i am aware that another hosteller had to summon staff twice in one night to deal with similiar incidents.staff seem unwilling/ineffectual at dealing with this problem.needs sorting
Germany,Male,18-24,7.1,4,8,10,10,2,8,8,"its a great place with a great location, the breakfast is awesome as well. but the staff has nothing to do with costumer service...    all was set up for trolley holidaymakers witch the hostel was full of  as backpacker you are in a minority and almost feel unwelcome. if you are only a backpacker over day in the area they won't help you. that has nothing incoming with backpackers idea or hosteling international.  it was sad to see how a awesome backpacker.place was turned into a commercial."
Germany,Female,25-30,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"great breakfast, just two minutes from the beach, clean toilets and bathrooms i would def come again nxt time i'm in santa monica"
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i really enjoyed my time at this hostel.  it was my first hostel experience by myself and i felt very comfortable.  the location was by far the best aspect of this place.  a block away from 3rd street promenade in one direction and a block away from the santa monica beach and pier in the other direction.  not to mention all of the public transport spots all around it.    the hostel itself was very nice, pretty clean and comfortable.  some of the staff was very kind, others seemed a bit put out."
Finland,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"friendly staff who was cleaning all the time. computers could be free with a time limit ! (most people have their laptop, but those who don't  would appreciate that service ) free coffee and tea very nice. bread and jam for breakfast little bit dry and jelly-style but free, so won't complain too much :)"
Switzerland,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,i didn't really liked the bed. i was in a 6 bed room and the beds are very small and not very comfortable. and it would be an asset if on every bedside it would be a plug to charge their phones or laptops. also the showers didn't looked very clean.
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,"included breakfast was great!  dorms/bathrooms no worries.  free comedy night was hilarious.   staff were great, but seriously, not enough of them for such a big hostel. i spent so much time waiting in line each time i needed to speak with them.  atmosphere not that friendly. if you're wanting a party hostel, this probably won't do."
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,"very good hostel, despite i had to pay an extra charge cause i wasnt a hi member when i arrived,   if u are looking for a cheap hostel its not the option, but its very good"
Australia,Male,25-30,6,6,6,8,6,6,2,8,"no character at all. it felt like a hospital. locker room style showers and toilets wasn't too good. no power outlets or lamps on/near the bunks (which were quite sqeaky as well). cleaning crews coming in to vacum sometimes around 8-9am, which i found a bit odd. vey clean hostel, and a great location near the beach, but that's about all it had going for it......"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"great facilities, clean, comfortable, would recommend to everyone."
Argentina,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,4,10,10,"great place, although the guy that's sometimes at the door doesn't seem too pleased with you presence.   oh, and don't be fooled, they'll charge taxes and etc, so it'll be $32 for the cheepest bed."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i wish i knew there were lockers in the rooms, i paid $5 for the ones downstairs then went to my room.  this is a great hostel though, loved the common areas, beds and rooms were roomy.  thank you."
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i ever had!
Japan,Male,18-24,5.7,2,8,10,2,8,6,4,shower room is so dirty that i can not take a shower.
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,8,8,"big, airy, clean contemporary, cool hostel. loved being able to walk to the beach in 5 mins, dorms nothing spectacular but nice....and i liked all the different little communal areas dotted around the bottom floors....nailed the hostel experience!"
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,8,10,10,8,6,4,4,"i liked the location but the staff were a little rude when i needed information. the place was well kept and maintained, lots for the guests to do. good wifi and lots of computers to use. the kids running around bugged ma a little. the two guys in my room stank to high heaven, they need to open a window. that really ruined my stay. hair all over my bed. so gross. didn't stay the second night purely due to the stentch. the male bathroom was also pretty terrible. good for a night or two."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i liked too much, the place is wonderful for all types of persons."
China,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very nice staff and service.  i just spent one night there, only one problem bother me: the shampoo is not very good to use."
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,6,8,10,"free luggage storage while i was waiting for my plane would've been nice but overall a very secure and well layed out hostel, giving the illusion that it's not as big as it actually is!  also nice and close to the beach :)"
China,Female,41+,6.3,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,"and some comments about my stay there.     what to keep doing: the breakfast is very good.    what to fix: some staff can not understand international guests'english phone calling.     what to add to make the hostel the best: to make the airport shuttle booking 24hours available.    i stayed in your hostel from dec.27th-30th, room 301-02(els).i enjoy the time there.  i left an adaptor(white, small square form, only three holes,on the wall)and a knit woolly hat(dark green). i called the front desk about that"
China,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"good: 1) clean and safe place. 2)nice staff but not as nice as in duohousing l.a.. 3) nice location, easy access to public transportation. 4） great  breakfast  bad:  the hostel can accommodate more people but i feel there is less communication.   overall it is a nice place to stay."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"old but clean, well equipped  location also good"
Taiwan,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,"it's a good place you can go to the beach in 10 min by walking. but little bit far away to downtown la and hollywood, you need to take bus like 30 to 45 min. right next to the hostel there is a tourist agency which will offer special discount if you stay here. staff service is good also. the only thing which i don't like is you can't get wifi in your room, only in first and second floors and the speed of internet was so so slow especially in the night...."
China,Female,18-24,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,"good location where you can enjoy sunset and sunrise everyday.and there are a lot of interesting activities.the only complaint is about the noise.every night there is a lot of noise outside my room.but overall,it's a good choice to stay there."
Spain,Male,41+,6,4,8,8,8,6,4,4,if you are not a hi member the price you pay is different from the one you are said when you book. they charge you $3 more for every night. it'squite a boring place. you can't even drink a beer in the hostel. some people live in there and the room i was staying in was totally messed up.
Canada,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"beautiful hostel, very well-located (close to 3rd street promenade, next to the beach). they give lots of info on how to get places, etc."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,was a great experience and a wonderful hostel. the only think i think they could improve on is having an age barrier as the old generation that came in on my extended made it awkward and uncomfortable when sitting in common rooms.
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8,10,8,8,8,8,4,10,"nice hostel in nice place but lacking a bit of atmosphere. lack of bar or drinking area means that socialising in the hostel is minimal, when i was there everyone seemed to be isolated and sat on their laptops the whole time, making it difficult to talk to and meet new people."
England,Male,41+,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"very well organised, safe and secure and fabulous facilaties"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"breakfast should have stayed longer until 10:30 not 9:30 i think, and everyone in my room was charged more than originally quoted which we were all abit unhappy about. and i didn't get the gold card that i paid for or the discounts it's meant to get you, so that was a waste of $10."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"this is the best hostel i have stayed in. landing from a long flight, it was perfect to relax and then help me set off on my feet when ready.     staff are great, place is comfortable and really clean.     you can stay in santa monica without a car and get a few local buses, hire bikes or just walk."
Malaysia,Female,31-40,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"the hostel is at an ideal location, clean. it organises activities through out the week and a good place to meet other travellers. i certainly enjoyed staying at h.i. los angeles."
Switzerland,MixedGroup,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"excellent hostel, defenately great value for money. we had a great time there and no reason for complaint whatsoever."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay at h.i. it really is a home away from home.
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,0,8,10,0,6,8,6,"the toilets were a bit dirty , most times had to go to a different one as they were filthy . i think that a makeover of the bathrooms are in order as showers were a bit crappy as well , water was either too hot or not hot enough !! otherwise its a great location , with lots of activities to do , via from the travel agent next door and on site as well ! would def stay there again though !"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,very clean and tidy hostel.  well set-up and in a great part of la.  i  would highly recommend staying here.
Australia,Female,25-30,5.3,0,8,8,0,2,2,8,"the hostel is huge and everything is clean but the hostel misses massive character, there is no buzz... there is no bar and alcohol is not permitted which sucks seeing everything in la is super expensive!  the staff were horrible. they were rude, arrogant and made it seem like a chore and that they were going out of their way to answer our questions.  there was a mega sleazy guy working there who made us feel very uncomfortable and was super rude to us after my friend denied him a date."
England,Female,25-30,6.7,0,8,8,0,6,4,8,the promised activities were not delivered on.
Belgium,Male,31-40,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,nice place to stay and close by to the sea. hostel is clean and well run.
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"fantastic location, really nice rooms, lots of activities to do."
England,Female,31-40,8.7,0,4,10,0,10,10,8,"during my stay, a man came in during the middle of the night.  i think he had been sent to the wrong dorm.  my dorm was an all girl dorm... so i was a bit suprised to see him enter our room in the middle of the night.  i spoke to the reception and they thought someone had given him a key card to enter the room... i don't think it was an error made at the reception."
England,Male,41+,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,very pleasant and helpful staff.
BritishVirginIslands,Male,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"a great stay in california for sun, sea and hollywood history! a good effort with hostel activities where you meet a lot of individuals."
England,Female,31-40,8,0,8,6,0,8,8,10,"the location of the hostel is near the santa monica beach which is nice if you're spending most of your time at the beach. if not, it's far from everything - town and tourist attractions. there is no metro serving this area, so i had to take a bus to beverly hills (45mins) or to get to hollywood or universal studio, take the bus to the nearest metro station (about 1hour away) and takes another 30mins by metro, so 1.5hrs! other than that, the staff are friendly and the hostel has good social vibe"
England,Female,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"couldn't ask for a better location if you're looking for beach-side accommodation.  plenty of buses going to all major tourist areas in la/hollywood if you take the time to look for them - lots of info at the hostel.  rooms are spacious enough with sink, toilet and shower in room.  great cheap place to stay in a pretty expensive city."
Canada,Female,25-30,7,0,8,8,0,6,6,8,"good hostel, staff was not overly friendly. hostel runs like a hotel making it hard to meet people."
Singapore,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"totally awesome. though it was a really short stay, i really liked it. yes it was kinda pricey for a hostel, but i felt it was worth it."
England,Female,,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,it's the second time i've stayed here as it's in a great location and is well keep the staff and activities are great but this time i stayed in a bigger dorm with it's own bathroom and it was a bit dirty and could have done with a clean.
Netherlands,Couple,25-30,6.7,0,10,10,0,6,4,4,"the building looks nice, but the dorms are crappy. the en-suite bathroom was disgusting and old, the toilet seat was broken and the walls were not clean. wifi is bad and no alcohol is allowed. there is not much organised and the atmosphere is not great."
Switzerland,Male,25-30,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,the location is very good and the hostel is very clean. but very very poor is the wlan! you are a lucky guy when you have sometimes conncetions in the lobby. better go to bean coffee for wlan close the hostel. poor is also the breakfast. the orange juice was almost just water and yogurth was offered very less . for this is the price of this hostel too expensive. also alcohol is not allowed. i wouldn't go back to this hostel.
Australia,Male,,7.7,4,10,10,8,6,6,10,"very expensive, staff weren't all that interested. but great location and very clean."
England,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"great location, friendly and helpful staff and the facilities are the best i've had in a hostel after travelling for 3 months in south america.  would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends on a budget."
Ireland,Female,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,6,10,"lovely looking hostel, fantastic location, safe and clean.a little bit dull and lifeless but a very nice place to relax and enjoy beautiful santa monica.free wifi and free breakfast is great!"
Slovenia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"the hostel is very big, almost like a hotel. the bad sid of it is you have to try harder to make concact with otrher people. the hostel is in a very safe location, it is clean and cosy. it also offers a lot of events and trips."
NewZealand,Male,41+,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,6,good place but bad wifi which they obviously create in order to drive guests to paying for the in house fee paying computers. staff response to a complaint about this was ... a shoulder shrug...
England,Female,41+,7.7,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"i was a bit miffed as to why you can only stay at the hostel for 14 nights, when they have students staying for 3 months? the meals were good and cheap, because of the student its not easy to mingle as they have their own group, i would stay there again if in the area....."
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"it was in a good location in santa monica, loved the included breakfast. was easy to book tours e.g la sightseeing and universal studios tours at the place next door."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great location. super friendly staff..  awesome hostel!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,6,8,10,"brilliant locaction, right near the beach and shops!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,such a brilliant place! serving breakfast makes a big difference that you wouldn't realize.  the location was brilliant as everything that was needed was within walking distance.
England,Female,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,6,10,"very clean spacious and modern. only down side is it is harder for someone travelling on their own to socialise within the hostel. but great location, meals offered every night for cheap, and lots of activities that you can sign up for to be more sociable if you wish."
Germany,Male,31-40,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,very good youthhostel in motel quality. location is very good and in the cenral of santa monica. i'll come  back again. wifi is slow because of to much access.....
Ireland,Female,18-24,6.7,0,10,8,0,6,2,10,"extremely slow wi-fi, which is ridiculous when they advertise themselves as having it available, and it is only available in the common rooms which means nobody interacts or talks to each other. breakfast was pitiful as well."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,6,not happy booking through hostel world. we needed to change our reservation and were easily able to with hi hostel but did not recieve any refund for the three nights that we cancelled with hostel world. word of advice- just phone the hostel and book your stay direct through the helpful and happy staff that work there.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.3,0,10,10,0,6,6,6,"the hostel was in a great location but was extremely expensive and did not include a lot of extras which other hostels usually include; for example free airport transfer and free luggage storage. i thought the $18 airport shuttle fee (one way) was exorbitant and paying $5 for a locker for the day (in $1 bills only) was frustrating. i stayed on the fourth floor in an 8 bed dorm for $50 per night which i think was too much, and it was extremely hot with no fan or air con."
England,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great location in santa monica and ideal for bus tours of la.
France,Male,25-30,7.3,0,8,8,0,6,6,8,"this hostel is very nice and close to the beach but it is too big for people to interact with each other. finally, it is a good place to sleep and get information on the city, but that's it."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,0,10,10,0,6,6,10,i liked my stay here really close to the beach and shops and the hostel puts on tours to go to la downtown and hollywood. but there were to many old people staying in the hostel i think one of the guys in my room had to be 80 and slept all day so had to be quite killed the vibe
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,6,8,"service was quick and efficient at the desk, and staff was nice.   a dorm mate was questionable, older woman who did not sleep in the dorm but would have her stuff in the room and making a lot of noise in the early morning."
Canada,Male,25-30,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,dependable... and the location can't be beat!
Wales,Male,18-24,4.3,0,6,8,0,2,2,6,"kids running around screaming at all hours ruined the aesthetic, cleaners took my personal pillow and after four days of trying to get a manager to talk to me i unsuccessfully gave up. internet was poor. i will never stay at a hi again."
USA,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great place to stay.  lots of activities.  i would stay here again.  really great location.
England,Male,25-30,6.7,0,8,8,0,4,6,8,"good hostel but nothing special for the price, guess your paying for the location. prefect for a nights stay!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"there were a lot of young childern running around,  not expected at a hostel with mostly young adults. the noise and the constant running around was a bit bothersome but other than that, no complaints!"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.7,0,6,10,0,4,6,8,awesome spot. nice and clean with bargain meals on fridays. would stay here again.
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"the best hostel ever! best location, perfect cleanliness, good breakfast, great structure. everything is perfect!"
England,Male,41+,6.3,0,8,8,0,6,6,6,"don't book the airport shuttle from reception, i waited 40 minutes and it never turned up. it would have cost $18. i then went on the public bus that cost $1 was 5 minute walk from the hostel and took less than 1 hour in rush hour."
USA,Female,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"my stay @ the hostel was much more then i expected. i met people from all over the world. everyone worked &amp; played together in a very impressive fashion. i was happy to see the no drinking/drug ordinances. this really helps. the location could not have been better. the help really made sure all needs were met expediantly!the help works very hard. i think if you had a few partime people to help host, or volunteer, or biz interns; it would be out of this world. thx jp"
Wales,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,6,10,"i stayed here for 2 nights at the begining of my stay in la and have changed hostels to come back here for my last 2 nights as well, because it was just so lovely. not the most lively of hostels, but i'm not 21 yet so that wasn't such a big deal. lovely vibe though, just very chilled, and gorgeous location; so close to the beach! definately recomend staying here, i felt very safe being a lone female 19 year old traveller!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"simply outstanding 'super' hostel. you don't really come here for character, it's got the feel of a large hotel in its presentation and the staff are very helpful and professional."
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,"awesome location, central to everything. movies everynight, great way to chill out in the evenings. key card kept failing to work, bit of a pain but would definately stay again, only shifted because they were booked out, should of got in earlier......"
Ireland,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i was traveling alone to santa monica and i had searched a few other locations but they seemed over priced and too far away from the pier and 3rd street (which is where it all happens) and then i found the hi hostel right in the centre of everything, i was a little unsure at first as i never stayed in a hostel before but i decided to give it a go, when i arrived the place was as stated perfect, the staff where really nice and friendly and the rooms when perfect, i am going to be going back there"
England,Female,25-30,7.3,0,10,10,0,6,6,6,"like a big hotel, good all rounder, excellent location near the beach :) i'd stay again."
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,"i really loved this hostel. i loved the location, even though it is an hour by bus to hollywood i thought it was great being near the beach and a street away from a main shopping street. the staff were so helpful in telling you about how to get places and things to do and see. the security was really good with good sized locers in the room and a security door to get into not only your room but the main hostel area. the breakfast was also very good. i would recommend this hostel to anyone!"
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,5,0,8,8,0,2,2,4,"bad staff and absolutely no fun at all.  my flight got delayed, i've called then and warned then about it, but even so they've cancelled my reservation around 2am and made me ""homeless"" for the night - and also charged the ""no show"".    no alcohol is alowed in the hostel, so obviously ppl do not interact. actually ppl don't stay at the common area for fun.    finally, the bathroom are not clean. both man's and girl's."
Belgium,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,the hostel is overall really nice and the beach is just a block away.
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9,0,10,8,0,8,8,10,"the hostel is well organized, staff is friendly and helpfull. it is a nice place to stay."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.7,0,10,10,0,6,8,10,"hostel was good, had some good nights out. the rooms were very clean.  downside was there was a staff member that was not helpful or friendly at all, was an older man. they cancelled one of the tours and didnt tell us and when we asked him he said it was still happening and so we waited for about 20 mins and we asked him again and he told us it wasnt running. as if we should of known and got angry at us for asking, he was very rude. everytime i asked him something it was like i was bothering him"
USA,MixedGroup,41+,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"i wish the center courtyard was a non-smoking area. my son and i didn't want to use it because of the smoke, plus the smoke blew in through the windows and doors into the dining area. otherwise, the hostel was great and i would recommend it to friends."
England,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"really good location with great organised events and loads of free information. good cheap food and clean rooms and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, would definitely recommend it."

Denmark,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"good location, friendly staff and great facilities for a hostel."
France,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,8,6,"the hostel was great and we really enjoyed our stay there. the room was nice and the breakfast was very good. the only thing we did not appreciate was the bad cleanliness of our roommates. we understand this is not the responsibility of the hostel, but if the hostel team could remind all the customers that they are sharing rooms, and therefore need to respect the other roommates, that would be great. (some of them basically consider the room as theirs, and we had the feeling to be their guests)."
England,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel. two possible improvements:  1. get better beds.  2. get sound proof windows: trucks cleaning the street outside stopped me from sleeping.
Germany,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"+ good location in st monica   + top security with key card and lockers  + nice atmosphere with court yard, library, tv rooms, ...   + discount for tours in the belonging shop next to      but figured it out by myself, no information at the reception    -"

Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,my friends and i loved this place. we checked in early and our luggage was placed in a secure area while we checked out santa monica. the staff member who helped us also gave us our own room of 4 instead of the room of 6 we had originally reserved! h.i. held daily activities which allowed us to make friends with everyone like the trip to malibu and a pub crawl (one to remember)! the bathrooms were maintained and the breakfast and dinners were great! definitely recommended!!
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"we booked a 4 bed private dorm, but when we arrived we were informed by an unapologetic staff member that there had been a mix up and had been 'upgraded' to a room with a private bathroom, however this supposed upgrade was to an 8 bed dorm, and the 4 of us were split over 2 rooms. the staff member was rude and unapologetic about this mix up, and never gave us an opportunity to move back into the room we originally booked"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this was a great hostel!    the activities were great - awesome sunday hike, good movie nights fantastic open mic night and a really good pub crawl with impro comedy.    great location near the beach and nice shopping area and easy to get around to places like the getty museum, venice beach and downtown with directions supplied by staff.  good deals on tours too.    the 6bed dorm was comfortable.  the breakfast was good and well organised.    an all round good hostel experience!  top notch!"
England,Male,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"this is a really good hostel in a fantastic location. i had a really good stay here, good enough to go back to which i will be doing in a few days. i would recommend this hostel."
Sweden,Female,18-24,7.7,0,8,10,0,6,8,6,"very good location, right in the heart of santa monica, good alternative if you dont want to stay in l.a. when we made the reservation here on hostelworld we got a confirmation letter telling us the total amount of the stay, but when we arrived we had to pay 3 dollars extra / person / night because we werent members of the yha, therefore the total from hostelworld wasnt right."
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"good beach location, lots of activities going on. but typical large hi that can seem a bit impersonal if you are traveling alone. well run"
Netherlands,Female,31-40,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"this hostel is in the best location, is clean and has lots of information on where to go and how to get there. there are also some free guided walking tours and free breakfast.     what i didn't like were the curtains, they let al the sunlight right through so i woke up each morning before 6am. also our room was facing the courtyard and the noise of the air vents was very annoying."
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"i was only here very briefly and felt like i had missed out by not staying longer and making the most of the facilities and opportunities.  the hostel has everything a traveller could want, it's clean and comfortable and has some really nice chill out areas as well as putting on tours and activities for guests."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,hostel was amaizing. will stay there in the future when i return to la
Germany,Male,18-24,8,0,10,10,0,8,6,6,"+ great location, nice staff, average price.  - cleaning staff comes into room while guests are sleeping!"
Netherlands,Male,18-24,6,0,8,8,0,4,6,4,"unbelievably bad staff. totally uninterested in you, your questions and your comments. beds are bad, so are the bathrooms. basically the only good thing is the location. it just keeps amazing me how bad hi hostels in the states are, especially if you consider how much they charge.  charging money for basic services like luggage storage (even if the check in leaflet mentioned free storage for a hour). overall big and expensive disappointment."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,10,6,10,cool location but you cant bring alcohol into the hostel and there arent heaps of places to go out nearby
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,0,10,10,0,6,6,6,minimal hot water.  untidy bathrooms. hair dryers not even working  dorms were really warm....too hot really  the only good thing about this place is its location. seriously!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,"santa monica is the perfect place to base yourself whilst in la. great hostel, close to the beach and travel / tour centre right next door to help organise anything you want to do!!"

Brazil,Male,25-30,6,0,6,10,0,4,6,6,"one of the worst nights i've had in the us. people running in the hallway at 2am? c'mon. it's your responsibility to keep the hostel quiet, not the customer's. just monitor the hallways every 15 minutes and see if there's trouble. also, outlets! usa hostels provides 4 p/ person. wifi? did not work in my room (303) and did not work in the fireplace area."
England,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,8,8,10,nice hostel in good location near venice beach.
Wales,Female,18-24,7,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"the hostel was clean-ish. showers were a little slippery. as it was quite a large hostel, it didn't really have much character to it and i found it difficult to talk to people. also, the ceiling in our room leaked quite badly when it rained! the beds were fine. it was just...ok."
Italy,Female,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,6,8,8,excellent location and great commune areas. very close to the beach and the 3rd promenade with shop and restaurants. i will recommend stay at this hostel
England,Female,,7.7,0,10,10,0,4,6,8,"hostel in an ideal location for the beach and tours. its 3 buses from the greyound station to the hostel, taking just over 2 hours. or you could splash out and pay $50 for a taxi to the hostel!!  hostel is a typical hi, clean and well run. nice place to stay, apart from the girls on reception not exactly friendly or helpful, which does surprise me for a hi . absolutely no alcohol allowed in the hostel. so save your dollars for the local happy hours."

Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,6,8,8,"very close to the beach and the santa monica mall.  free breakfast was a plus, good tv area.  lifts weren't working at the time and hot water was on and off."
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,6,10,10,"the hostel was amazing! the location is perfect.    but the elevator was broken and is going to stay like that until middle of feb. the other problem is the internet connection, that is completly slow.    but i highly recomend."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.7,0,8,8,0,4,2,8,"in 6 months of travel hi santa monica was the worst hostel we stayed in! they should actually take out the s and make it hotel as the place was full of old people and they take every opportunity to make an extra buck. cold showers, unfriendly staff, lame activities run by volunteers, no alcohol allowed in the building, and you pay extra on top of the already excessive price for internet and locker storage. definitely recommend staying elsewhere!"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.7,0,10,8,0,8,6,8,"one girl member of staff (blonde chick with beanie) was particularly helpful but most other staff were average to help with things. it would have been better if there were more activities planned so more guests can interact, and if the internet was free for those without computers. beds were uncomfortable! but brekkie included was a bonus."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"a fantastic hostel in la/santa monica. santa monica is a great place to stay in la. it might be an hour from downtown la, but try finding somewhere in la that is close to everywhere. buses run all night to downtown and hollywood. shuttle bus from the airport is only $15 (super shuttle). the hostel is spotless, huge kitchen and heaps of rooms to relax and meet fellow travellers. will definitely stay again."

Canada,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"the staff at the front desk ""tried"" to be helpful, but did not seem to have many suggestions as to what a tourist should do on a free day... or on christmas for that matter. also there were mixed stories as to why there was never any hot water for showers, and the fact that once you check out, the hostel would only store your bags for 2 hours was kinda lame. but the hostel was nice, very hotelish... the tv room was the most social oriented room in the hostel. 2.5 out of 5 stars"
Canada,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,6,8,10,"this hostel is for families and travelers of all ages, so no alcohol is allowed. however, they plan great activities, like hikes, pub crawls, all you can eat pasta/hamburgers, etc. the lobby has a fireplace and is a great way to meet people. the only thing that i didn't like was that the showers rarely had hot water, and it took them a really long time to fix it. otherwise, a great location, and a good hostel. really clean."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,awesome location so close to the beach and santa monica pier. found it hard than usual to make good friends being that there is no bar and not so much of a social atmosphere. but htey do have some cool activites you can sign up for  where you can get amongst it and meet people

Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"by far, the best hostel i stayed in over 4 months! there were plenty of activities, location was fantastic - very close to many busses, the beach and the famous 3rd st promenade (shopping!). the attitude of locals in santa monica was very friendly and relaxed. this was the one place i felt comfortable walking alone after dark. the staff were also very helpful (though at times appeared bored?)  bathrooms were clean and plentiful. rooms were also very clean!"
Australia,Female,31-40,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,this hostel was fine. great location in santa monica and friendly enough staff and travelers.
Austria,Female,31-40,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,there was a little problem with some air condition - which was too loud during the night. but they gave us a discount for that night and were really caring.
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"huge hostel in a really good location on the outskirts of la.  staff were always helpful, breakfast was good.  hostel was clean with plenty of activites to do.  would definitely stay again."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,6,"great location, and having a (paid) shuttle bus right to the door was wonderful. the kitchen with free coffee/tea was open 24 hours and they had great free tours &amp; meal deals. only complaint was a mild smell of urine (or something equally cloying) that seemed to be in the room; aside from that - great place to stay"
Canada,Female,31-40,8.7,0,10,8,0,8,8,10,"this hostel is in a great location, very close to the santa monica pier. i spent 3 days here, relaxing before flying to bangkok. i'll be back when i return from my trip through asia. :)"
England,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel had such a good time there organised events are great and the hostel is really well laid out and social
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,excellent hostel.  one block from good shopping and great food and one block from the beach. would stay here again.
England,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this hostel is fantastic - fresh, clean, new, minutes from the beach. a really great place. friendly staff happy to go out of their way to help.  if you wanted to chill out you could and if you wanted to meet people and get involved in the activities this was also possible."
Australia,Couple,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,it's a very big hostel so everyone just kinda sticks to their own groups. but the breakfast was good and so were the facilities. and the lockers were a really good size :)  overall pretty happy :)
CostaRica,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"the cleaning lady took my towel (the one i brought from home) &amp; the towel from the hostel &amp; didn't leave any towel for me : o (, but then i talk to her, &amp; she was nice &amp; help me. : o )"
Germany,Female,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"very nice and clean hostel. the location very good and quiet, close to all and there is a bus around the corner which brings your for less money to beverlly hills, hollywood and downtown. good and enough breakfast in the morning!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"one of my favourite hostels in the usa so far!    not very social as there is no one common area for everyone to go and meet new friends...but it is hands down one of the cleanest, safest and most convenient hostels i have stayed in.    close to shops, a police station, the santa monica pier, and heaps of restaurants. will stay again!"
Germany,Female,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,"great hostel in a perfect location! the rooms were big and had lockers, ensuite bathroom had a seperate shower and toilet and there were two sinks as well. though there were 10 girls in the room, there was plenty of room for everyone to put their luggage.   the location is also a big plus, very close to the airport with shuttles available and in walking distance of shops and malls.   every night, there was an event taking place which gave the opportunity to meet other travellers."
Oman,Female,31-40,9,0,10,10,0,10,6,10,"a very well-run hostel, which, while of course mostly visited by young people, was very suitable for a traveller in her mid-thirties who wants to travel cheap. everything is really clean, in excellent working order and everyone are friendly and helpful. not a party hostel at all, you can't have alcohol in the hostel, but that forces you to mingle with the locals. the area is great to be a tourist in, walkable, bus-able and with great cafes/restaurant/bars/people."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,0,10,10,0,6,6,10,"location fantastic, but i find it easier to meet people in smaller hostels. this is big and spread out. also another american non drinking hostel, which is different when you've travelled in europe and they simply don't exist. i'd stay again however"
Australia,Female,18-24,7,0,8,8,0,6,6,8,clean and centrally located. a few trips are organised by the hostel but not much that you couldn't do on your own. quite a big hostel so not great to meet people if you travelling alone. staff were helpful when approached.
UK,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"excellent loacation. very clean and modern. plenty of facilities (large kitchen, free wifi etc) would recommend to anyone."
Liechtenstein,Couple,25-30,6,0,6,6,0,6,6,6,"not flexible if you don't show up, will charge the whole amount plus lots of taxes to your credit card :/"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"the location is great! one street from the beach and santa monica pier, one street from the main shopping promenades of 3rd and 4th street! a police station is located directly across the street from the hostel but as a female solo traveler i felt very safe walking around during the day and early evening. facilities are very modern and the elevator was a great help when carting luggage up to your dorm! bed was already made, towel provided and huge free breakfast! i will totally stay here again!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,cheers 4 the excellent stay people
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,0,8,10,0,6,2,6,"boring for what you pay for. but it's close to what you need. got kicked out for watching tv and falling asleep, apparently half awake i said that i didn't have a card - a little staff discretion maybe?. it's no fun when you have a right to be there. also, the shower burns you when someone flushes the toilet. forget having skin. a fun time for single travelers/young reveler but only if they don't expect the hostel to provide it. imagine grandma as a hostel. one that hasn't yet tapped the gin."
Wales,Female,18-24,6.7,0,8,8,0,8,4,8,nice clean hostel in a great location. because it's so huge though it's really hard to meet people. good choice for free breakfast.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,awesome / clean hostel! one of the best i've stayed at. beach is so close by and the people are friendly and helpful. must see - getty museum!!
Scotland,Couple,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"typical hi hostel - good activities, good free pasta and breakfast, good rooms,bathrooms good good tv and videos and stuff. internet a bit steep, but everything else good. location perfect, just near santa monica beach, takes about an hour to two hours from the greyhound stations to get there though. i would advise getting off at the hollywood station and not the main one which is dodgy! if you are, dont go at night! santa monica v safe though!"
Spain,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,6,8,"nice hostel, clean, nice staff , nice lobby and internet room , and good breakfast."
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,6,8,"only stayed there for a night, due to a stop over at lax. though not in the mid of la, it is in an awesome trendy location, really close to the beach, would be back!"
Algeria,Male,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,a ggod place near the beach (venice beach and manhatan beach are not very far from that place) beside that it's close to the 3rd st promenade where you can find a lot of shops and restaurants.
Australia,Male,25-30,7,0,6,8,0,8,10,8,"typical hi hostel, clean and value for money. staff helpful and in a good location. the organised activities were a bonus as it would have been boring for me if they were not organised. i liked it, id rather stay here and catch a bus to la than stay in some dodgy joint near the city."
Ireland,Female,31-40,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,10,good base from which to explore los angeles.  i have stayed there twice and had good experiences both times.  would stay there again.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"first hostel experience at the start of a 5 month trip. good hostel, security, clean. breakfast was good. had to walk a fair way to get to the toilets from the room. great location in santa monica though. social atmosphere ok."
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,4,10,"if you want a quiet place, this is it.   no alcohol inside the hostel, not even at the bar! besides that little detail, the hostel is good. great location!"
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,0,8,8,0,6,4,6,"good place clean but not alot of fun as cant drink in the hostel, makes pre drinks and meeting people a little hard."
Australia,Female,18-24,7,0,8,10,0,4,6,8,i would stay here for the location again! for the short time i was there i didn't really get a good vibe from the hostel. the guy at the desk was one of the rudest people i've ever been served by. he would make guests line up until the clock actually struck 3 haha. but apart from that the rooms were clean and big and so were the bathrooms so really and truly santa monica is what you make it but probably spend as much time out of this hostel as possible ps. bus to san fran is great value!
Japan,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,staying in this hostel was so much fun!!
England,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,loved it fantastic location helpful staff x
HongKong,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,very noisy and hot at night
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,8,10,"this hostel was good. the staff are lovely, the tours offered are great, the kitchen was great.  i was there while the lounge room was being renovated, from what i could see it looks like it will be great. bathrooms could do with an update and the rooms desperately need more than one power board. overall, i would stay here again. it was comfortable, great location, and had many great amenities. "
Sweden,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean bathrooms and shower, bed was nice and soft but my bed was the only one in the room that didn't have any jack to charge my electronics.    free breakfast and refill of clean water for your water bottle "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,‘twas lit fam
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,4,"they were undergoing renovations when we stayed here, which i think led to an unusual smell in our room and an even more unpleasant odour coming from our sink and tap in our room. other than that very lovely, spacious private room and good facilities "
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,2,8,8,8,"overall the atmosphere, staff, location, all amazing. my only issue was the stairs situation. stairs to get up to front desk, plus stairs if you have a room on the 3rd floor, and so people with lots of luggage or heavy luggage, it can be difficult. also the bathroom situation, a bathroom for both male and female on each floor would be so awesome, especially if one has gone out for some drinks. that was my main issue. otherwise everything was great. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"hollywood blvd us a little noisy on a saturday night. and the hallways are a little to loud. foot steps and voices echo pretty far, but overall, very nice stay and super awesome staff. i checked in at 1am, and checked out around 8am (just needed a nap), and caught their free breakfast. everything was super clean. really above my expectations for the price i paid. awesome night!"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,great location (though hard for uber drivers to locate). bathrooms were always clean and were cleaned multiple times in the day. free breakfast is good too. 
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i cannot give a rating about this hostel but have only heard good things. i have a uk unrestricted passport with no criminal record and cam to the states under the vwp (visa waiver program) and was deported on the next flight home as i had not yet purchased my return ticket. one officer told me to buy a return ticket and come back in 5 minutes. on the final confirmation page a different officer came an took my ipad away and told me it was too late.. i am completely shocked.
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was really impressed by the hostel. we were warmly welcomed as we arrived, our room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was good.   the tours the hostel offered was the best in my opinion. you can sign up for free and get a guided tour to several destinations within l.a.  if you sign up and dont arrive - no problems, its very flexible.   i'd highly recommend to stay here, i'll definitely come back!"
USA,Male,25-30,5.4,6,6,8,4,6,2,6,"good location if you’re into the very touristy walk of fame and shopping. the hostel had a musky stale smell in the air. the employees looked very unenthusiastic, i’ve seen hospices with more energy than this hostel. we came the night before nye hopping to stay there and didn’t even stay the full first night before we got on a train and just went to sd. they closed off the common areas after hours. outside the hostel is the walk of fame but very crowded streets. could’ve just been a bad night "
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,10,8,10,6,6,8,8,"location is perfect and it's pretty much clean! the staff is just ok. points of improvement: reduce the volume of the music from the common area (it's far too high untill late at night). having a lady cleaning the male common bathroom all the time, is also very umconfortable..."
England,Male,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, right in the centre of hollywood. friendly staff and a reasonable breakfast."
NorthernIreland,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,10,4,8,"i enjoyed my stay, it isn’t the best location if you are looking for good nightlife close by.    the staff were friendly and made the stay better, the free hike to the holywood sign was a laugh with carlos. barry the irish lad on reception was helpful &amp; happy to have a chat with.  "
Australia,Female,18-24,6,6,8,10,4,4,4,6,the walk of fame hostel is located right in the middle of hollywood boulevard making it super convenient to see the sights of hollywood. however the staff are extremely unfriendly and make it seem like such an inconvenience to help with anything or answer a simple question. the atmosphere around the common areas is depressing and staff couldn’t tell me many details about the daily activities. rooms are nice but stink like b.o. 
Canada,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"good clean hostel, can't beat the location on the other side of the hollywood highland metro rail station."
England,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,first ever stay in a hostel and i was pleasantly surprised!   such a clean place to stay- toilets and showers were spotless throughout my stay.  staff were super helpful and friendly.  organised trip was great and other travellers were friendly.   would definitely recommend. 
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place  staff was very nice lots of tours everyday great breakfest  rooms clean very good hostel  would stay again !
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"good for location and hostel provided lots of great info on what to do in the area, the staff were very knowledgable and could give recommendations. we were a group of 3 and they upgraded us from an 8 bed dorm to a 6 bed dorm which we had to ourselves the duration of our stay, was quite a nice perk."
Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"this hostel is in a great location of you want to see hollywood without making a social trip. very close to universal studio and in any case it's across from the subway which can take you anywhere you want to go!!    the common room is located very close to some of the rooms and the quiet hours are midnight to 7 am, so if you want to go to sleep early good luck! there is a pool game and loud music usually going on until very late. the breakfast in the morning was great and good quality.  "
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"clean and tidy place to stay for the night, small kitchen available to use, shower cubicles were a bit small, room was decent. overall satisfied with my stay, $60 for one night was a bit much. staff were friendly."
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"for the price and location this hostel cannot be beat! it is about as centrally located as a place can be in a city without a center. you're in the heart of the hollywood action, and it's equidistant from the ocean and downtown. the staff is friendly and helpful. i had fun shooting pool and drinking brews before i went out at night. the bathrooms are clean and spacious. there was always an available shower. i would recommend this hostel to almost anyone."
Indonesia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"yes, this is a nice hostel located straight in the opposite of metro exit which is good. you can walk to metro station just by 5 minutes. the room is clean and neat, but there's no ac, only fan. security is good but don't forget to bring your own lock!  overall, this hostel is really value for money."
Romania,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i've ever stayed in. perfect location, very clean, great showers, comfy bed, nice staff and really good price. i would surely stay here again."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,we found that the hollywood walk of fame hostel met our needs during our 2 night stay in la. we had a private room on the 1st floor which was modern and clean with good facilities. the location was very good. one issue however was that the female toilet facilities were on the second floor which meant a long walk during the night to use toilet facilities. it would have been good to at least have a unisex toilet on each floor to avoid this. the breakfast was decent with a good selection of bagels.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great staff. great place. highly recommend. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,8,8,10,great place in a great location but having the male bathroom on one floor and the female on the other is annoying
SouthAfrica,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,decent hostel in a good location. can be very noisy on the walk of fame so be careful which rooms you pick. 
England,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,"good location for public transport and attractions such as walk of fame &amp; wax museums. room was way too hot and no air con, only a small fan for 8 people. also the ceiling fan only worked with the light on, not ideal for sleeping. good bathrooms and adequate breakfast. "
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location. great hostel
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.7,4,6,10,4,6,6,4,terrible - we changed hostels. luggage storage room didn’t have a working lock. only one female bathroom on a different floor and at the other end of the hostel - 4 showers not enough. room was stifling hot and absolutely stunk of body odour. bags don’t fit under the bottom bunk so there is no space to move. half of the electical outlets didn’t work and couldn’t be reached from the bed. no rule against people staying who are living in la or over a certain age! makes for a creepy environment. 
Spain,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"the staff is really nice, and the housekeepers too, always smiling and willing to help you.  there are arranged tours for the guests and a schedule with all the programmed activities which i found great to get to know other people."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location right in the middle of everything. metro is straight across the road which is very convenient if you need to get anywhere else in the city. front desk staff and housekeeping are amazing at their jobs. breakfast had great options. 
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay.  excellent staff and location.  very clean and excellent facilities.  highly recommend to stay here when in la.
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great time bed in a quiet room. i'll be back!!!!!  
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,10,10,6,10,"bathrooms were really nice, clean. parking in the back, is $20 a night, but it's in a secure area at least. walking distance from a walgreens in case you need anything."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,really nice hostel. had the perfect location. staff were welcoming and very helpful. i left my wallet with my credit card and passport in my uber. the staff helped me contact the uber to get it all back within the hour. 
Thailand,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,perfect staff!  perfect location!  worth for the price 
Thailand,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"i would recommend you to stay here!  so close in hollywood st, u just get off from metro and then you will see hostel! u don't need to walk too much! i have lot of stuff and  one small man staff (i din't know his name) help me to carry my suitcase. i'm so appreciated because its so heavy! breakfast is okay but bathroom, toilet is good and big.  so this hostel is good. you should stay  there."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i've stayed at 
NewZealand,Couple,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"walk of fame hostel was right in a great location with plenty to see right near the hostel, including a shopping centre across the road. our room was a decent size but my only issue was that there were no plugs easily accessible from the top bunk meaning i had to use the plug by the bottom bunk which required me to awkwardly try and avoid touching the feet of the person sleeping on bottom bunk. breakfast was okay but not much variety. staff were great tho and they have awesome daily activities. "
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,6,10,"this hostel is right in the center of town and easily reached by public transport. i joined in the hostel activities each day i was there (hike to the hollywood sign, beverly hills trip, downtown tour) which were free of charge and super fun. i hung out with a really cool and diverse group of people who quickly became friends- from across asia, europe and north america aged 19-mid thirties.the hostel is a little annoying to close down the common area at 12pm so you can't chill in :( "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"right across the road from public transportation! needs a little better signage, everything is was great!"
England,Female,18-24,8,6,10,8,8,10,8,6,"really good, bit expensive but its la!"
Brazil,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the breakfest is so nice! the staff is friendly and the localization is perfect. 
USA,Male,31-40,3.7,2,2,6,4,6,2,4,this is hostel is for young kids who are looking to party. hostel was ok facility wise but the music was so loud all night it was hard to sleep. parking is $25 added cost of you drove. all around i just did not feel safe there and would never stay again.
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,10,10,10,6,10,4,8,location is great! staff is friendly and helpful with anything!  it's just a pitty i had to walk up stairs for the girls bathroom everyday just for showers and toilets. the common area is not lively at all and they turn the lights out at 12 so there is no where to hang out.  
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"clean and comfortable, lovely staff, but sooooooo noisy. even with the windows closed it was ridiculously loud. otherwise i enjoyed my stay!"
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hotel was in a perfect location if you want to be right in the centre of things, a little noisy perhaps if you aren't that way inclined! staff were helpful and friendly and the bathrooms etc were clean and tidy."
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay beds super comfy and great location will definitely stay again when i come back and staff could not have been more helpful. definitely recommending this hostel to anyone going to la. 
Greece,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,8,10,"great location, a bit noisy though at least the street facing rooms. super clean. great staff and very helpful. basic dorms did not have a/c. the kitchen is not very equipped but there are plenty of affordable options in the area. "
Australia,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"staff &amp; cleaners do a great job. rooms on hollywood blvd side susceptible to street noise, vendors, performers, loud music into the night. ear plugs a must as widow needs to be open for air, in 6 bed rooms. rooms have fans to cope with heat of weather. one night seeking a cool spot, experienced no relief from both loud street music and that played in common room. easy to get to from lax. opposite hollywood &amp; highland station. public transport convenient to attractions around la. yes!"
England,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,8,10,"nice hostel, could do with more bathrooms!"
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,6,10,"this place is in a great location! clean, wifi worked, plenty of bathroom and shower space. they had the old school keys which was a pain to carry around. the biggest complaint i have about this place is the facilities. no labeling of food, so refrigerators were packed, there were no plugs up top for people, no lights at the beds either, and only a few seats for breakfast. tons of stairs beware. good a/c, most of the hostel basics, outings, and friendly staff. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"great place and location. just be aware that certain rooms (not all rooms) come without a/c. so if you prefer a room with a/c make sure it says deluxe in the room choice. i chose the 6 bed mixed dorm without a/c because i didn't plan on being in the room much. they did provide portable fans and the room came with a ceiling fan as well. also, if you're in to meeting people hang out in the common room and participate in the weekly events. i met a lot of great people that way! definitely recommend!"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,4,10,10,2,10,6,10,"if you're looking to stay in hollywood and tourist central, the hostel could not be more convienently located. the rooms are clean but the hostel has only one restroom for women, so it can get crowded. the atmosphere was somehow lacking, with not many activities in place. it offers decent hostel style breakfast and the staff is friendly and helpful. there is no ac and the fans are of not much help during summer season."
India,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,6,2,6,8,need to improve on the fan and night staff nature as some of them were very rude.
England,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,loved staying here! great location with the metro literally outside the door. the only drawback was at night the room got really hot because the aircon only came on at certain times! on the whole though i loved it!
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,6,6,8,6,"i booked here because of the fantastic reviews. it's not that great. location and price are great of course. staff is ok, not great not terrible. the breakfast is bagels, fruit and juice, but it is free so... my problems are: there are no plugs next to the beds only a power strip that really any one could take your phone while you are sleeping; there is only 1 men's and 1 women's restroom and they are on 2 separate floors, there also seems to be no air conditioning in the room. "
England,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,couldn't be any closer to hollywood if you tried. we were at the back of the hostel and didn't find it to noisy at all. the hostel puts on greay trips each day that don't cost much and the rooms and bathrooms were mostly very clean.
England,Male,18-24,5.1,2,8,6,4,6,4,6,"there are multiple reasons as to why i wouldn't recommend this hostel, but most importantly is the simple lack of a/c in the standard dorm rooms. this is unacceptable for almost any hostel in america, but especially for one operating in la at the peak of summer time with temperatures over 30oc. i would accept this at a hostel that charged low fee's, but this institution was really rather expensive, and for the money, represented extremely low value given the other options within the city. "
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was a great stay at the walk of fame hostel. it is really close to many attractions and the metro is right across the street.   the hostel also offers many activities to explore the city together. that's great when your re traveling alone and want to meet new people.  all in all i would definitely recommend the hostel.
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"great location and staff, clean rooms. no air conditioning in rooms, very hot."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,6,10,the rooms were really hot but location cant be beaten (right on the boulevard).
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"the place is set in a great location, the staff is always cleaning which is great , my only complaint is that my room has no a/c and was very hot"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"nice hostel, modern and clean. good facilities nice staff. room was extremely hot though and noisy, but hey it's in the middle of hollywood."
Canada,Male,18-24,5.1,2,6,10,2,6,6,4,no ac smelt terrible never using hostel world again! 
Belgium,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,6,10,"hostel has a great location, right at the walk of  fame  we had a room at the side of the streeft, very hot and a lot of noice from the street. bring earplugs! "
Singapore,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"it has a good vibe, very clean with cleaning ladies around 24/7, awesome people. i'm not a fan of the hollywood area but most of the people here made me want to stay longer. the facilities are generally very good but the stuffiness of the room despite the three fans was intolerable. i was on the bottom bunk and none of the fans reached me, which i was baffled by. the laundry room made laundry easy and convenient, props to that. the breakfast is basic but very fresh."
Philippines,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location. walkable to any landmarks in hollywood blvd. very clean and friendly staff.
Canada,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,"my room was so sticky and hot, and the shared bathroom is meh.. social atmosphere isnt that great. not my fave, especially for the price."
Australia,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,great location. rooms very simple. 
Canada,Male,25-30,7.7,6,10,8,4,8,8,10,location is definitely in the prime tourist area and literally right across the metro station so that's a positive. however the downside to this is all the noise. street performers perform right outside the window. with movie premieres happening there is a ton of noise and music. this makes it difficult to sleep.     the other downside was the fact that there were no acs in the room. in a room full of 6 people it was very hot in there and all they had was a fan which only circulated hot air.
England,Male,31-40,7.1,2,8,6,8,10,8,8,"for the duration of my stay there was construction &amp; refrigerated trucks outside the window from 3am daily. i didn't get much sleep. no air con, so leaving the window open was necessary. facilities were great, everything was clean. breakfast consisted of all bread products and one type of fruit, so if you're gluten intolerant like me, you're forced to find alternate brekkie. i was severely over charged for the room compared to what hostel world advised. i'll be following up with hw on this."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"first time in a hostel and i couldn't have been happier. the staff were all friendly, doors always locked, clean every day, nice breakfast in the morning to get you started, a pool table to kill some time, organized outings, and the location was awesome. look out the rec room window and you see street performers on hollywood blvd...very cool. "
Egypt,Female,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,#NAME?
Philippines,Female,31-40,8.6,8,6,10,10,8,8,10,"it was nice to have an a/c'd lounge to hang out in after a hot day outdoors, there were outlets (adding a few more would be nice) and water right on hand. had a top bunk which was a bit unsteady to get to, but the room and bathrooms were kept clean, and i always appreciate hostels where the beds have their own little shelf and outlet for charging. can get a bit warm in the room despite a ceiling fan, but for the lower bunks there's an electric stand fan on the floor."
England,Male,41+,8.3,6,8,10,6,10,8,10,good location and always saw cleaning staff maintaining the place.
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"stunning location only stops from union station and patsaouras commuter station with metro, sensational concept incorporating the necessities;  featuring exceptional artwork that sizzles.  reminds of the london sohostel so much in mindbending clarity of purpose, design and execution with extra space.  forget the old tinseltown when options were few.  thrilling concept and with very few complaints.  a movingly fitting climax to my bucket trip.   thx!  some like it hot my dear.  no regrets here."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,awesome location. super friendly staff  air conditioned rooms. had a great stay. 
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful.
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant stay..great way to meet new people, awesome group activities held daily to explore the city and in the heart of hollywood. couldn't ask for a better stay "
England,Male,25-30,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,10,"not great. a guy in my room stole my laptop and camera; as well as other possessions from other people in the room. i can't blame the hostel for him stealing stuff but the guy was incredibly sketchy and shouldn't have been let in. the lockers were too small for bags to fit in properly. totally ruined my experience but then again, hollywood isn't a very nice place anyway"
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,"location within hollywood couldn't be better, rooms good but extremely noisy because of the street noise...cleaners do an amazing job cleaning hostel constantly. rooms have no air con which meant it was pretty stuffy."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,it was an enjoyable stay. the staff were helpful and friendly and the people in my dorm were also friendly. 
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,good hostel in a fantastic location on hollywood blvd. great breakfast too!
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"would highly recommend this hostel, it is very clean as they have cleaners there everyday working all day. the staff are so friendly and go out of their way to help. the only thing i could complain about is the noise from outside, it was only on the weekend though ( let be honest most people are going out then) so it wasn't that big of an issue. there's a great area to socialise and meet new people. i've been to a lot of hostels and this one is definitely one of the best. "
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,6,4,4,2,10,10,2,"pay the little extra money and stay at usa hostel down the block. i wore flip flops and contracted a fugal foot rash. the rooms have no air conditioner and only 2 fans, the room is very hot and leaving the window opens lets in the constant noise from the street. the entrance is a huge staircase, there is no elevator and it smells like urine from the homeless people. there is 2 power points and you hope no one unplugs your phone to make room for there's. you also have to pay $2 for a towel."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,6,4,10,6,6,8,4,the rooms are very cramped and lack any ventilation making it very hot and stuffy especially at night. the security (whilst you buzz in) is not great and we ended up in a 7 people in a 6 bed room for several days as someone brought a friend back. the entrance smells of urine and isnt well maintained. the location is very convenient and really the only positive thing. 
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is awesome. worth paying a little extra. really clean, best hostel breakfast i've had. good location. rooms are big "
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,8,10,great location. even the back alley is jimmy kimmel's studio. adjacent to all the classic theaters and tourist attractions. plenty of clothing stores and shops hollywood is know for. the bar and restaurant scene stretches to west hollywood and sunset. hollywood all comes together with a local vibe from side street neighborhoods criss crossing the blvds. you can hear the pulse at night if you are planning an early day.this hostel catered to all ages of adults. sunday don't miss the farmers market
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"extrodinary about this hostel was how friendly the staff was! they kindly helped us with all our questions. the location was good too, just across from a metro station which turned out to be really handy!   watch out with going out at night though, even in the heart of hollywood you've got annoying men following you arround. the neighbourhood is good during the day time though."
Egypt,Male,31-40,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i really enjoyed staying there ... it was really amazing clean place, cooperative stuff, good location near the metro station but i noticed that they added to the value mentioned at hostel world 14% taxes without any pervious notification"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,8,6,6,8,"right on hollywood blv, which has both its benefits and disadvantages. the dorms facing the boulevard are very noisy with street noise and traffic, and it can be loud all night - pack earplugs. hostel has good facilities, comfy beds and is clean.   the staff were helpful in helping me with travel arrangements and getting to points of interest.   there are activities organised by the hostel - tours to hollywood sign etc - so you can meet other travellers. "
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"excellent location and atmosphere. close to all the main attractions and easy to get around on the metro which is right across the road. only one minor thing is that two people checked into my dorm after 11pm. i think if someone checks in late they should get a private room, but not be charged much more. that way more people can choose private rooms if need be, without breaking the bank. other than that i loved my stay here and all staff were very friendly and helpful."
Wales,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,10,4,2,10,"amazing place to be if you know the people you with, as it had good facilities and location, but it was a horrible experience on my own! as much as i wanted to connect with people, no other travellers were at all respectful of each other.  staff, aside from one or two, were very unhelpful, and very unclear in their directions, to the extent of being rude. would recommend as a well-functioning hostel, but would be afraid to stay there again alone."
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,10,4,8,6,4,"room was hot, smelly. great location right on hollywood blvd. staff was friendly. i wouldn't stay here again though"
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"the only complaint i would have is that my room was unbearably hot most nights, so hot that you'd be dripping sweat. the room also had a strange odour that was seperate from how the rest of the hostel smelt. also, since we had a window that looked out into hollywood blvd, you could perfectly hear all of what was going on outside even if the windows were closed. besides my complaints with the room, i'm impressed with the location, the staff and the facilities. i would come back!"
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,8,10,10,10,"wonderful location, nice staff, cleanliness. but the bathrooms are limit, you may wait quite a long time to take a show."
Pakistan,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i liked staying at this hostel. it has a good location. metro station  is just infront of hostel. you can get a metro pass(depends how many days you are staying) and go any where via metro you want. staff was so nice, i reached there early,  they offered me to wait in the lobby area (air conditioned), stored my luggage. tea was available all time. they also guide you about places you want to visit in la. "
Austria,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, right on hollywood boulevard and close to the hollywood sign. friendly and helpful staff, high security and awesome people. met cool guys there i'm still in contact with now!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel and location watched a movie premiere from our room and the common area. pool table was a bonus also!!  
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"overall a really decent hostel. great location and facilities. really good outings organised by staff, and all the staff were really friendly and helpful. very clean and organised. i don't know what licensing laws are but felt the common area could be awesome if there was alcohol served. the staff were great and would be an awesome excuse to get them out and socialising with guests. expensive part of town, but a great first stop, thanks guys!"
Greece,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, great cleanliness, cool staff"
Australia,Male,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,6,4,4,6,"so over expensive, check in staff were unfriendly and rude and most staff was unfriendly except for one guy, room was dirty and smelt bad, breakfast was only ok.   the location was good but other than that certainly nothing special"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was wicked. easy to get to via metro. huge rooms and living areas and was right amongst it all. only down fall would be the noise from the street but the location is definitely a bonus so not a huge biggy.
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,6.9,10,6,10,8,2,2,10,"bathrooms, kitchen area and common areas were always clean! i stayed here 4 years ago and it was much better then, with nightly activities happening, if they happen now we didn't know about it as we got no run down on the area and things to do, the guy just checked us in and on our way we were. we didn't get any hints or tips on la/ hollywood, luckily i had been here previously and new the area, however the people i was with didn't. very disappointing."
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a great stay at walk of fame. central location, really clean, good rooms/ bathroom/ games area and free breakfast!   only downside was the inflated price for a hostel. it's the most i've ever paid and i've stayed in hostel all over europe, south america and the us "
India,Male,25-30,8,8,8,2,8,10,10,10,"avoid the rooms on the side of the street .they are super noisy through out the day. there is always some idiot playing drums at midnight.  otherwise it's a really good place...very friendly staff , free guided tours and generous breakfast"
France,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great location, nice friendly staff, but the common room close at midnight and the bathroom is not the best"
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location for this hostel is great!!!! it's right in the middle of hollywood boulevard! the kodak theater and shopping center is right across from the hostel!! it's a perfect central location! however, parking is a pain. nearby lots are $30 for overnight parking and most (if not all) parking garages don't allow overnight parking. the free street parking is a few blocks from the hostel and i don't feel comfortable walking by myself at night in hollywood."
France,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"the cleanest hostel i have ever seen. there is always someone who cleans, even in the middle of the night!  the location is just perfect. right in the middle of the walk of fame, next to the tcl chinese theatre, the dolby theatre and next to the red metro line. people are quite respectuous as at midnight the lights of the lounge are switched off. cameras are everywhere . the breakfast is filled up regularly as there is always something to eat. the staff is available and very helpful."
Denmark,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,"it is a quite expensive hostel to stay at however the location is super nice.   there's shared bathrooms and toilets, and there can be a line. the toilets weren't the cleanest one.   the commom area and the kitchen is good.   "
Norway,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,had a great time!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i only stayed here for one night but was really happy with my time there.  i arrived at 9:00am but check in time wasn't until 2/3:00 pm, however it was not a problem for me to us all of their facilities while i waited including showers (well needed after 25hrs in transit) as a solo female traveller i felt very safe here, and the staff were were warm and welcoming. the dorms and bathrooms were very clean. overall the vibe was great and the other travellers were all super friendly. "
India,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"amazing location, great breakfast and good beds. wish shower rooms were longer. "
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is a great hostel. the room was large and had plenty of space for everyone's bags and the bed was comfortable. there were enough bathroom facilities and everything was very clean. the location is perfect - right in the middle of hollywood and subway and buses right outside.
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"it was a cool place right on hollywood boulevard had the things you needed. the only downside i found at least in the room i stayed in, is there is no ac. need some ventilation. they do provide fans  and if you drove. expect to be paying $25 a night for parking right by the hostel. but it's nice to walk right out to the famous street!"
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,8,6,6,8,"great location if you want to be in the hustle and bustle. after staying in many youth hostels and backpackers, i really didn't enjoy the atmosphere in this property."
Sweden,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"good hostel, there's cheaper ones nearby but if you want a nicer one this is the one to choose! great location, good activites and met some nice people there!"
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,10,6,6,8,"decent place. pretty chill. literally everyday at the same time there was a lady cleaning the bathroom when all the guys are trying too use it (like 9am) and i found that a bit strange, a guy cleaning the bathroom while every women is showering would never get away with that... the staff serving breakfast seemed a bit grumpy too."
Mexico,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,2,6,10,"the hostel is good average rating, staff could be nicer. "
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,the shared restroom/shower facilities were always kept clean...and it was reassuring to see the cleaning staff very often. the hostel was busy...just like the street it's on. great location for everything hollywood. you are right in the heart of things. it would have been nice to have a mirror in the bedroom.
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,10,6,fun lol  very noisy. 
England,Male,25-30,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,"not a bad hostel, centrally located in the middle of hollywood so that's a huge plus, but other than that a pretty mediocre hostel, atmosphere is pretty dead at times. "
Jamaica,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i spent two nights. i really enjoyed my stay. the staff is very knowledgeable and approachable. i stayed in a for bed dorm there was lots of space. the hostel has a lot of space in general. the common area has a pool table and lots of seating. overal the hostel is very clean and the location is perfect. most of the travelers were friendly also. i would highly recommend this hostel. thank you for everything! 
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing hostel in a great location. i never felt unsafe in the area which is good for a 19 year old girl travelling by herself. all the staff were so friendly and helpful and even printed me out directions to get to places. i would definitely stay here again!
Italy,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"this hostel is awsome! best location, super clean (you can smell detergent at all time) great environment! i would totaly come back!"
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"my first time staying in a hostel so i didn't know what to expect.      location:  location is fantastic.  opposite the hollywood highland metro stop so very easy to get to from lax.  rooms:  the rooms were fine and were cleaned every day by housekeeping.  they were very warm but then, what else can you expect when you travel to la?  staff:  staff were friendly and accommodating (even when i was coming in drunk at 3am).  people:  sometimes this can't be helped but they were a great bunch for me."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hi guys,     i'm from australia, coming here was the best decision for me. the staff and the cleaners have been so welcoming here. they are all so very helpful, friendly and welcoming, it has made my stay here a lot more comfortable. i recommend this to anyone wanting to travel and in wanting to experience staying in a hostel........last of all safe travels my friends.....😊 "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,6,6,8,"great position, fantastic spot on the boulevard right across from some major attractions.    clean enough, breakfast was great but staff a little abrupt. didn't offer much information about hostel itself or what's around.    in saying that, as a solo female traveller it was safe, there were clean beds, with lockers to store belongings. bring a padlock 👌    all in all a good stay."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,6,8,8,2,"you watch the oscar from the room or the common area. however note that if you're staying here on the day of the oscar, the street is closed off i.e. you cannot go in or out of the hostel between 12noon to 8pm unless you are checking in or out (which is not mentioned at the time of booking) but it's still very close to all the actions in hollywood."
Germany,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,"nice hostel, although nothing special. staff was helpful and pool table and tablesoccer are fun. the breakfast is amazing.   a little smelly, but not too bad. "
Mexico,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great location, i only needed a place to sleep and shower for a couple of days since i was taking care of my own stuff during day, so i can't say much about the atmosphere and hostel in general, but for what i needed it was perfect and i always found the facilities clean. breakfast was nice"
Argentina,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,8,8,i spent 2 days at the walk of fame hostel in la. the location is excellent. breakfast is great. i absolutely recommend this place because they help you with tours and advices. great place to saty in la. i hope to see them some time in the future.
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,they should offer power outlets inside the rooms. having to go to the bathroom or another comum areas to charge the phone was annoying.
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,first of many stays here! hope to be back soon! 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my first time staying in a hostel but i absolutely loved it. the location is great, right on hollywood blvd and close to just about anything. i was able to meet people from all over the world and had a blast. i would definitely recommend this hostel!"
Canada,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,4,8,"great spot, great location. awesome that they offer a light breakfast! staff were helpful at answering questions. could have done without the loud, club music blaring through the halls during all non-quiet hours. doesn't really make for a nice relaxing spot to sit and relax between touring around la. "
NewZealand,Male,31-40,8,6,8,10,10,8,6,8, will definitely stay again if in la on a budget. clean and easy to find. stuck-smuck in the middle of hollywood.
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i loved my stay here! i met people from all over the world and made some incredible friends!  this hostel isn't the fanciest or the quietest-so if that's what you're looking for you should stay somewhere else.  i'm a very social person, so it was good that i stayed there.  "
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,3.7,2,6,8,2,4,2,2,"rooms are dirty, different from picture. when i arrived i felt very embrassed. so i went to another accomodation, i already paid one night though."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were super accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure that we were well taken care of. the bathrooms were awesome; warm water showers that were separate to toilets and had a separate changing room too. great location to shops, food, and public transport. "
USA,Couple,18-24,4,2,6,4,4,6,2,4,"quite hours(after 11) were not respected; there were people talking and laughing well into the night. it was finally quite after 3am. room was so cold, and had a strange smell. breakfast was so-so. for the price, it's better to stay in a cheap motel in a quieter part of the city. "
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,"reliable wifi, clean facilities, free bagels etc; for breakfast. common areas are sufficient, and rooms are clean. price is high, but so is everything in los angeles. i would stay again."
Germany,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly staff, clean hostel and awesome free breakfast. i stayed in the female dorm, all girls in there were super friendly and i felt safe all the time, didn't need to lock away my belongings. the female bathrooms were clean all the time. would definitely stay there again! thank you :) x"
Thailand,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,the staffs are very nice! the hostel is located in the great area. 
SouthKorea,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,good location to access attractions
France,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,10,6,great place for a short trip ... 
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"great hostel, highly recommended!"
Ireland,Male,25-30,6,4,6,10,6,4,4,8,"great hostel if you enjoy being right in the middle of hollywood boulevard (hence the 10 for location). but sadly everything else about the place was a disappointment. no atmosphere, the noise on the boulevard gets a little overbearing and the staff weren't very helpful (or knowledgeable) when approached and provided no helpful suggestions for activities or things to do. "
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,the staff is very friendly and helpful. i would definitely stay again in this hostel
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"mice place, good staff and facilities. located is perfect."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,8,8,6,4,"the location is awesome, but the rest is average... the room smelled very bad, no air conditioning, no place to put your luggage. the cleanliness in the bathroom was fine. the atmosphere was, unlike other hostels, not very connective. i think there were hookers that used the bathroom a couple times, which i thought was pretty weird, since apparently anyone could get in. the hostel is fine if you are in the city all day long, but otherwise i didn't like it a lot.

Mexico,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"location is perfect, inn &amp; out is two blocks aways, great bars are a couple minutes away walking. good value for your money, not the prettiest but decent "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a travelers favor, excellent location right outside is the walk of fame, you will literally see a michael jackson impersonater right across the street! man the beds ar extremely comfortable with many plug outlets right next to the bed! breakfast is dope! alll of the employees are phenomenal guest area is quit comfortable 😎  "
Ireland,Male,41+,5.7,6,8,8,4,4,4,6,"maybe i was just there on a bad day, but this was the most unfriendly hostel i stayed in. the staff were fine but just average in terms of friendliness and willingness to help.  the hostel itself did little to encourage socialising and everyone pretty much stuck to themselves. its fine to land in la but i wouldn't stay here for any length of time and hope that you'll meet other people. its not conducive to this type of experience."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"i highly recommend! the location of this hostel is better than most hotels, at half the price. people of all ages were staying here so it was not like a fraternity house. the room i stayed in was clean so was the women's room. also the metro railway is located across the street making travel to the airport and other tourist destinations very easy. mainly i have no complaints but beware the rooms do not have a/c. "
Philippines,Female,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,my 1st hostel experience and it was amazing! 
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,4,10,10,10,8,10,10,"been staying here for the last 7 years! anytime i come to la its my go-to spot. when i started sleeping in hostels, it was about $25. with the several changes in management, its skyrocketed. no hostel should be more than $30. you're sharing a room with strangers for god's sake! lol. overall great location and super safe. "
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"stayed at hostel as was running a 10k on hollywood so was exactly where i needed to be! amazing location. staff were helpful and friendly . the place was clean and had good washrooms.   only complaint was that the rooms were really warm at night, but i only stayed in the hostel literally for 7 hours so may have been a reason. i would certainly stay again! thanks! "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had an absolutely amazing time.
Peru,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,its location is perfect! the rooms and bathrooms are very clean. i highly recommend it!
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"love this place! absolutely amazing location, right in hollywood blvd! close to food, shopping, tours and attractions. awesome events planned by the hostel and always been a good atmosphere when i've been there. the staff are super friendly and helpful, some of the best i've dealt with. clean bathrooms, warm showers and even a separate room to do make up etc. rooms are big with comfortable beds. highly recommend "
India,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,nice location for first time vistors! 
Spain,Male,25-30,5.7,6,8,8,4,2,6,6,"bad staff, they cheating us on the price so i will denunce them to recover 30$ that we shoud not pay."
USA,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,8,6,"the location is the best you cold ask for.the room could have used better furnishings;the light above was dim and not good for reading,there was nowhere to sit because the lower bunks were taken so all of the tenants' possessions were cluttered on the floor,and there was a huge fan on the floor just taking up space.  still the common area was nicely arranged.the music didn't need to blast so loudly;some people might want to do some work in quiet."
Australia,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"wonderful, i would stay here again"
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,8,6,"the location is great if you want to take advantage of hollywood, universal, warner, and the many things to do around. if you want beach/hippie style hostel you should better stay near santa monica or venice beach. staff is nice and also great activities to do. the room was really smelly even it was clean, it was the only bad thing but the rest was great!"
China,Female,41+,5.7,4,2,10,6,8,2,8,"the hostel is in good location, but that is all.  it is very noisy after the sunset.  on friday and saturday nights, the noise may last until 3 or 4 am - can you sleep in a loud music in a room without  ac? sunday night became better, but the noise still lasted after the midnight.  staff are friendly. but shower rooms are somehow blocked with hair and some other  stuff. i lost at least $40 cash in my room, but on the other side, she did not take all of my cash - take care of your belongs.    "
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,5.4,4,6,10,2,8,4,4,"shocking place ... apart from the location which was really good , the showers were far to small , the room was the hottest place i've ever stopped with one small fan  and for the price surely there should be air con .... really really disappointed ... staff were to busy it seemed to give a damn about the place , wouldn't recommend and certainly wouldn't go back "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,awesome location and central to most of the major tourist attractions plus the train is across the road and so many buses on the street. any shuttle from airport will take you to hostel for $20. we went on the hike to the hollywood sign was good but the group to the clubs wasnt very big. you need to bring your own towel or rent one for $2. 
Croatia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hotels ever! beds are  really comfortable and it's really clean. location is also a hudge plus. i have no complaint.
HongKong,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing location, very clean and nice staffs.  love to stay there again if i have a chance to visit la again. "
USA,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, very nice and helpful staff, fun activities including a hike to hollywood sign and a beach. the only thing i wasn't happy about is that the kitchen wasn't really equipped for cooking. only a hotplate with two burners and the room itself was small and didn't have a sink. you have to go to another room to get water or wash something up. "
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,it was my first stay in a hostel and i really enjoyed myself. my stay put away all of my premonitions of what staying in a hostel would be like. i plan to stay here again when i travel to los angeles.
Australia,Female,18-24,5.7,2,10,6,4,6,8,4,"i'm so surprised at what a good rating this hostel gets.     as others have mentioned, the rooms are unbearably hot - even though the air was quite cool outside at night, opening the windows or using the fan did nothing.     it's ridiculous that there's not toilets for everyone on every floor. the showers are also very small.    the location is good if you like noisy, trashy, dirty hollywood but i'd recommend doing your research first. i wouldn't return here unless it was half the price. "
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,6,10,10,8,"location is perfection, the rooms are amazing, the staff were 'real life' friendly (not just because its there job). 1 minus was the hanging out areas close way too early. i understand it may be for noise purposes but it would be nice if they just included a sign or something, because they were plenty of times i wanted to get to know new people and everyone would have to leave at a certain time and it became awkward. other than that and price, this place literally is amazing."
Italy,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"best location, but hostel could be more social"
Philippines,Male,31-40,7.1,4,8,10,6,8,8,6,"hostel's location is its selling point. pros: location, breakfast, daily hostel activities you can sign on to.  cons:  rooms are hot! no a/c, they provide a fan but its of no help as the air is hot. so if your not used to sleeping inside a sauna, then goodluck on your good night sleep.  also the street noise if you're a light sleeper. it doesnt normally bother me but compound it with the sauna heat in the room, i was in for a tiring night."
Australia,Female,25-30,4.6,8,6,6,4,4,2,2,"i found the staff rather unfriendly - they weren't rude at all, just not the usual friendly helpful staff i expect at hostels. the atmosphere was lacking also. i felt pretty uncomfortable during my stay there to be honest. the hostels i stayed at in the weeks previous to this, in the uk, were far better. the bathrooms (showers) were filthy and uncomfortable. the toilets were regularly in a disgusting state."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,great location. good breakfast. beds should've been a bit bigger and nicer. i would definitely recommend it. 
Botswana,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"honestly the staff make you the priority. there were no complaints really..there was day i missed breakfast times and il take the blame but it would have been nice to get approval to grab even a muffin before my hike.    i love the daily activities that give you options during your stay , i met lovely people that added to my experience and grant the event director is such an awesome lad! very helpful and thoughtful."
Turkey,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"i enjoyed my time at this hostel. it has good location. its also cheap and clean. everbody is nice. i liked this hostel. but wifi wasn't working well in my room. except wifi, everything was so nice."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"there is nothing good about this hostel except location. no air cond in the room even the weather is about 28c in la, kitchen is not kitchen, just a super small room for u to warm ur food, just two small stove if someone cooking there i don't think u can cook it. breakfast? if u went like 8:30am u can't see even one bread, they don't refill n i see some one packing their lunch box with bagel n fruit they provided in hostel. so we went like 8:30am n we eat nothing. ended up eat outside"
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,private rooms very comfortable.
Israel,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,6,10,10,10,really expensive but maybe those are just the average prices in l.a. no air conditioning in the room which was awful cus there was barely air to breath.. breakfast is fine. toilets/baths didnt work great and there are lots of girls so it was a bit inconvenient.. not to bad though. location is fine. just across a train station if you dont have car
Israel,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"pretty good value for money. located in a super-busy location so take it into consideration. otherwise, was great."
England,Female,25-30,8,8,4,10,8,8,10,8,nice hostel - organise lots of trips and good to have breakfast included. we had a few issues though - twice they messed up the bookings so we ended up with 7 people in a 6 bed dorm. the second time was the worst as this was only realised when one guy came in at 1 in the morning to find someone else in his bed. it took nearly an hour to resolve the issue and disturbed everyone. the fact that twice they didn't notice that 7 keys had been handed out for the same room is also worrying for security.
Malaysia,Female,41+,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"in great location. easy excess to metro red line , hollywood blvd and main attractions. it has several floors . no elevators. if you don&amp;#39;t like stairs this place is not for you. bring your own towel. it cost me $2.00"
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my 1st experience staying in a hostel &amp; i&amp;#39;m from no. ca and just came down to the l.a. area to see my son perform in a college production. i needed to save money so i stayed but didn&amp;#39;t quite know what to expect. i was pleasantly surprised at the comfort, cleanliness and the hospitality overall. i definitely recommend the walk of fame hostel in hollywood to anyone who&amp;#39;s traveling there and i will definitely consider staying there agsin in the future when i go to see my son again. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"hostel was great, has everything you want. people were nice. they have free events to attend each day. really liked the vibe and the location could not be better. bathroom cleanliness could be improved. but you know its a hostel"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"good hostel. grant and jordan were both amazing, taking us out to venice beach/santa monica and adults only, great times. appreciate it guys "
England,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,it was good to stay there. liked that there were toilets but not to sure about the showers.  bed were comforty. 
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,8,10,tyler was the only helpfull employee. got some issue with my booking because i didn&amp;#39;t mention the second guess was a male. they apologized about the mistake and gave us a private room. 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff was amazing
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i like ensuit bathrooms, there was a communal bathroom/shower but i guess that kept the noise down in the room. pool table was great, met lots of really cool, friendly people while we all gathered around the pool table listening to music. organized events were well advertised and the hollywood sign walk was definitely a highlight."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,10,"very clean, which is what you want as a traveller, great location, but  didnt like that the bathroom door wasn&amp;#39;t a full door considering you have to walk past it with just a towel on to get redressed, also didn&amp;#39;t have any air-conditioning so the room was always hot, the hostel also gave my name out to my room mates who i didn&amp;#39;t talk to basically at all, which i feel like that&amp;#39;s an invasion of privacy and not happy about it at all as they didn&amp;#39;t contact me before giving it to them. "
Brazil,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"it&amp;#39;s good hostel, with a great location. i would recommend it for sure!"
England,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"nothing special, but american hostels are never great. it had everything you needed - showers were ok and there was free breakfast - but it was very average overall. as american hostels go it was good, but if you compare this to a good hostel in south east asia there is no comparison in the atmosphere or facilities."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,they offer towels and soap for fee. friendly staff and there is parking in the back lot for $20 i believe if you have a car
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,6,10,10,"great location if you&amp;#39;re wanting to be in the middle of hollywood. place was nice and clean, however had a bit of trouble sleeping because of street noise and the rooms were very hot at night. not that many showers for the number of people who stay there so sometimes had to wait but facilities were good. staff weren&amp;#39;t the most friendly or welcoming..."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,the walk of fame hostel is located slap bang in the middle of it all....hollywood boulevard. very easy location and access from the metro station hollywood highland which is directly opposite to the station.    the hostel is regularly cleaned and did not have any trouble at regarding the cleanliness and security of the hostel.     staff are very friendly and atmosphere was great. a big bonus was the activities organised by the hostel such as the hollywood hike and beach day to santa monica .
Australia,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location nice big roomy hostel. bagels and muffins for breakfast with good variety of bagels and cream cheese and lovely fresh orange juice. helpful eager staff. friendly hostel. comfortable bed and lovely hot showers. 
Italy,Couple,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thanks a lot guys ! had a great time !
England,Female,25-30,7.7,6,4,10,10,8,8,8,i slept so badly in this hostel from the noise of other guests both in the room but also the noise travelling up the stairs from a large group which got up at something like 6am for breakfast every morning. the 6-bed room was tiny with little space to put bags. there was also few plugs which were located only by bottom bunks. free breakfast was bad. free pool table was cool though and great location. bathroom was a cool lay out with plenty of mirrors for ladies to do make up. only 3 showers tho
England,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"location is very good, opposite the metro and right by a lot of tourist attractions. the rooms are very hot and we were only in a four man room so i can imagine the rooms with more beds are worse. breakfast is very good with bagels and spread and the communal area is fab. wifi was awful so it was hard to book other things. would recommend this hostel. "
Slovenia,Female,31-40,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"location is fantastic. when you step out of the hostel you already step on one of the stars on the walk of fame. subway is just across the street. hostel is clean, breakfast is good and atmosphere was great. stuff is very friendly. the only bad thing was line up for showers, there are just 4 showers for all the girls in hostel. over all it was very good and i would definitely come back."
Turkey,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,8,8,"the location is the heart of the l.a, next to subway, but if you like nature,quiet life it shouldn&amp;#39;t be your choice because walking around the hostel is always loud and glamorous lights ecc, kinda gets boring when you stay long,   the staff is really good,helps a lot when you have a question,there is no elevator but they carried my suitcase, there is no computer at the hostel but they made me use their own ecc,  the breakfast; don&amp;#39;t expect too much if you are a vegan, they give fruits atleast "
Thailand,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,very good location. the shopping centre and metro are just across the street. very nice staff and everything looks good and new. i stayed in private room and it would be better with air conditioner.
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was hesitant about spending time in la at first because i&amp;#39;m not a big city person. but staying at the walk of fame hostel made my stay very easy and so fun. i made great friends with the staff, specifically the wonderful tahj and the crazy jordan !   everything was always clean, the bagels for breakfast are deliciousssss   most importantly i know i&amp;#39;ll visit again because of the friendships i made! love you guys ☮💟☪"
England,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,8,4,6,8,"great location and great facilities. staff were ok. the rooms do need ac though, the fan wasn't really enough. "
England,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,stayed august 2016 and had a great stay. we had a private double which was really big and lots of space for luggage. the bathrooms were always being cleaned as we&amp;#39;re the corridors and  communal spaces. the location is great for access to the metro (directly across the street) and for tourist traps e.g madame toussards and cinemas. 
Thailand,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,the location is superb. transportation is everything you would ask for. even its a bit crowded but you have chance to meet lot of people. the daily activity was fun with helpful staffs. 
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"security is decent, but could be updated (small lockers).  staff is nice,but not all that chatty. grant, the hiking guide,is very protective and chatty as well as informative.   amazing cheap and local walking tours!  food is mediocre: bagels, jam, orange juice, butter.  rooms nice&amp;clean,my corner unit was bright. lots of outlets, but inconveniently placed around room. yes it&amp;#39;s noisy because you&amp;#39;re in the city, but common in cities. altogether pretty decent and can&amp;#39;t beat the location.    "
England,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,this place at first glance seemed a bit expensive but when i got there i realised that i was in the centre of everything that i wanted to be.   with a metro station just opposite the hostel it&amp;#39;s well connected with the rest of the city.   the activities that they had scheduled were also great and anyone could tell how much it&amp;#39;s worth doing the hikes just for the beautiful views of the whole city.   if i came to the city again i would definitely stay here again!
Scotland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i never usually write reviews but this was genuinely really good. so so clean and tidy- literally cleaning staff there all the time and the front desk staff super helpful. stellar location. 
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,breakfast was very limited and rooms were very hot despite the fan but overall great location and friendly staff and good range of facilities 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,10,6,"generally pretty good, the rooms and bathrooms could be a bit cleaner and it doesn&amp;#39;t really have much of a kitchen. it&amp;#39;s right in the middle of the tourist part of hollywood so it&amp;#39;s a bit full on outside all the time but it&amp;#39;s right next to a main public transport stop so you can get around pretty easily from there.    the crowd tended to be pretty social and they had daily activities so it was a pretty good option to meet people if you&amp;#39;re travelling on your own."
Germany,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"eine super location, sauberes hostel und bequeme betten. man kann wirklich nichts sagen - ist top.  würde ich jederzeit wieder nehmen wenn ich in la downtown übernachten möchte.  - ein kleines manko gibt es allerdings. das frühstück war wirklich nicht besonders gut. die auswahl war zu gering. (: "
India,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,i forgot to take the key out of the door....when asked for anothwr key they charged 10dollars and the staff was really really rude....we asked them to see the cctv if someone took the key out just to make sure  if our luggage is safe when we are out...they were least bothered didnt help us in anyway!!!
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"had an amazing stay at this hostel, the location is perfect, couldn&amp;#39;t ask to be closer!   the staff are friendly and helpful and it&amp;#39;s definitely worth the money!  great hostel overall and a great stay "
England,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,6,10,10,10,"this location is outstanding! the staff were very friendly and great at helping you figure out where to go, what to see and the best way to get there! the beds were very comfy! the only thing i would say is the facilities; there is no lift so you have to walk up a flight of stairs with your case, also you have to ask at front desk when you want to use the hairdryer etc..and you have to rent your towel! i would still stay here again though and recommend to others "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,hostel had everything you need. yummy breakfast. perfect location for hollywood and then train lines. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,8,8,8,8,10,8,"decent location but hollywood isn't all that, it got really got in the rooms no air-conditioning only fans that werent to adequate, great vibe hostel has awesome group actives which is cool"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel and perfect location.   dennis and creg helped me on arrival and departure with my bags.   jordan took us out to some really cool places, if in la again i would stay here. "
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,6,10,10,10,"great hostel, excellent location, fun atmosphere, clean facilities. only thing is the rooms have poor ventilation and are hot and stuffy - you will sweat a little (there is no a/c). we had the windows open, which face the street, so it was noisy in the rooms. bring ear plugs. overall, great experience and a lot of fun. "
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,10,4,4,6,8,"the hostel is located right in the heart of hollywood with all the tourist attractions. the bathrooms are roomy. the biggest gripe is that it is very hot. the common area has ac, but the dorm rooms don&amp;#39;t. it was among the most uncomfortable sleep i&amp;#39;ve ever had. you have to keep the windows open to get any sort of relief, but then the noise outdoors seem to go on all night. the staff is not very informative and had to figure a lot of things out myself. parking behind the hostel is $25-30 a night."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,great location. right next to subway. one stop from universal. all nightlife in around the boulevard. tyler at front desk was awesome. decent atmosphere with a pool table and foosball in common area. only drawback is that the area closes at midnight so you have no place to sit and chill after a night out
England,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,6,6,4,6,"comfy matress and lockers in rooms. great location on hollywood blv by the chinese theatre. for the price i would expect aircon as it was very hot even with floor and ceiling fan on. the ladies  bathroom was always really busy and therefore the floor was always wet and dirty, no fault of the cleaners just too many people. the staff were helpful but some could be a little unwelcoming. breakfast was ok but limited - bagels and mini muffins and oj. more of a party hostel so could be noisy at night."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,the place was great. awesome location. the hostel had a good vibe and the staff was helpful and friendly. the only thing i had trouble with was that it was ridiculously hot in there. but overall i had a great stay!
Denmark,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,8,6,"i really did enjoy my stay here and it was very central to the walk of fame. it could use a better entrance, since it was difficult to spot. "
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,great hostel
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,6,8,"such an awesome location. i would stay there again just for the location. the dorm had no lockers and only one power point.  the ladies bathroom was on the top level so it was a bit of a pain having to walk upstairs to go to the toilet. 2 of the showers were not working when i was there but there were 2 others. they were clean, which is the main thing! overall it wasn't too bad and i would stay there again. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"great location! room was hot and noisy due to being so close to the kodiac theatre but that was expected. hostel breakfast was average, staff were awesome and bathrooms were very nice.    if you want to be in the middle of the action, this is the place to be!"
Romania,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best location by far. very very friendly staff and cool people 
Ireland,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,"only stayed there 2 nights but had everything i needed and a good breakfast available, not really a party hostel from what i seen but more chilled out which isn't necessarily a bad thing, great location beside train station and write on hollywood boulevard"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,6,10,4,10,"the staff are great, location perfect, hostel is pretty cool however the downside is that there is just no atmosphere there. unless you go on a bar crawl or do a day activity then its pretty bad by hostel standards. people tend to keep to themselves which can be a pain if your shy or don't drink. that might just be the people staying at the hostel i'm not sure but if they improve that atmosphere then they are good to go as there in a prime spot"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,it was really great !  the locations is just awesome !  the stuff is really nice and the rooms are big and clean.  the bathrooms could be cleaned more often but it was fine :)  all in all a really good trip 
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was a perfect stop on our road trip through the west coast! amazing location and convenient amenities. overnight parking is available for $12 in a garage -- but you can easily park in the nearby neighborhoods. showers and bathrooms were clean, lockers are convenient, and giving laundry baskets by washing machines was convenient. despite the hot temperature outside, a fan and an open window was more than enough for the night. overall a great quality hostel experience by any standard. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,8,6,10,"not much of an atmosphere, but hostel was in a great location, 5-10 min walk to lots of attractions and a metro station across the road. bathrooms are clean but like a gym locker room which is fine but i found it a bit awkward. room was stuffy and hot, no ac but did have fans. could have more in room amenities, like a chair and more outlets spread throughout the room, not in the one place. storage cages would be better rather than lockers, which where big enough for a back pack but not much else"
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,6,8,10,"great hostel, but staff was kind of indifferent and the rooms were really hot!"
Israel,MixedGroup,18-24,4.6,2,6,8,6,2,4,4,"this was one of the worst hostel i&amp;#39;ve ever been in. the staff was horrible there was a staff member who kept looking for a fight with me and other people. the showers are horrible, super expensive like 51 for a night... dont go there for more than one night... never gonna return to this place."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,6,4,10,10,"great venue if you&amp;#39;re looking to meet people and have fun, good budget accomodation.  i was told it was the &amp;#39;safest&amp;#39; place to be.. but when i&amp;#39;m charger and adaptor were stolen, they refused to help me find the person even though it was all on camera. so with 10 dollars left to my name before leaving i had to choose buying  a new adaptor from them, over food for the day. not very compassionate for travellers in bad situations. "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,5.4,4,8,8,4,4,8,2,been traveling around the world.    by far worst hostel i've stayed at.  room stunk.  staff unfriendly.  showers aren't warm or they flicker between cold and hot. i love a good drink or 5 but when people partying till 1 or 2am on monday tuesday especially when the sign says quiet time from 10 or 11 it's quite frustrating.   however fantastic location.   would not stay again.
USA,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,the location was great. the hostel was very clean and the room was big and comfortable. 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a pleasant experience. staff were very helpful and polite. overall, it was a decent hostel and place to crash for a couple of days."
Poland,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"the location is excellent, just steps from the hollywood walk of fame. it's also easy to get there, as the subway stop is just near by. the staff was very accommodating. i didn't really like the bathrooms though ... (not very clean, there are only shower curtains, instead of doors)"
Colombia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent place excellent location, people, mates, cleanliness. the laundry helps to stay more time and the mates are easy going. thanks."
England,Male,18-24,6,4,8,10,2,8,4,6,"great location, and could be a good hostel, however it is a lot of money for what you get. the main problems are that there is only one set of toilets, so if you&amp;#39;re on the second floor, it&amp;#39;s fairly far away. also, the wifi was pretty much non-existent."
Wales,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the best thing about this hostel is the perfect location- literally on the walk of fame, so easy to  anywhere with lots of food places &amp; shops literally right outside! we stayed during a movie premiere too, so it was pretty cool to see that going on right outside the window.  the staff were all lovely, free breakfast was basic but nice &amp; the common area was nice &amp; pretty social. would definitely recommend. "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we loved staying here! visiting hollywood for the first time and being able to wake up and see hollywood boulevard from our dorm window was something special! exceptional facilities, service and general atmosphere. if we get the chance we will most definitely be back! thank you for having us and starting our first two nights in the usa   a-ok! "
Australia,Male,41+,7.7,6,8,8,4,10,10,8,"watch the showers, run hot and cold at same time , floor very slippery ,needs to offer coffee at all times not just breakfast"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,basic but clean rooms. good shower temp &amp; pressure at all times.  noise level from outside was quite acceptable with location. free breakfast a bonus. friendly &amp; helpful staff. would happily stay again. no secure smoking area but street front seems quite safe at all hours. 
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,6,8,great location for hollywood sightseeing. international travelers only. bathrooms too small and were always busy. must bring your own locks for lockers. expect to pay highly for parking. loud area. overall decent. 
Germany,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"very nice hostel, conveniently located at the hollywood blvd. parking is quite expensive though."
Thailand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10 out of 10. staff are friendly and my room is big and clean. my first time in hostel and i am so impressive.   lockers are provide in room and you need to bring your own key.
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"good location, the people gathering around the door was a little much though. "
USA,Female,31-40,5.7,6,4,10,6,4,4,6,showers and bathroom space were fairly large for hostel standards. i would stay here again mainly for the location.
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,4,10,8,10,"great hostel, terrible wifi though!"
Peru,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,6,8,8,"it was an ok hostel, but its la."

England,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,6,10,"overall, a really good hostel. as always a few bug-bears but that&amp;#39;s hostels for you. (staff member shouting in to his phone at 11:30pm outside my door = asked him to quieten down. snoring room-mate = i needed to put ear plugs in at 4am).  other than the fact that the &amp;#34;free wifi&amp;#34; doesn&amp;#39;t actually work - as in i can&amp;#39;t load a single web page with it - there&amp;#39;s nothing i could expect them to easily improve. (apart from a plug socket at each bed?)  facilities good and clean. easy, tasty br"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"great location for seeing all the tourist attractions of hollywood. right on the walk of fame, train station right across the road. the facility was clean, staff were friendly and helpful and the free breakfast in the morning was pretty good.     the only down side is the room i stayed in you could here everything happening outside. if you can&amp;#39;t sleep through the noise it is probably not the best place to stay. "
Turkey,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,i had a great time! breakfast wasn&amp;#39;t really good but location was perfect!
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"walk of fame is one of the best hostels i've stayed in! the staff are so helpful. cant thank the event coordinator jordan and also james for some of the best nights of my life! management was amazing, so helpful in every way. thank you!!!"
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,really easy to find from the airport &amp; in a central location in the hollywood area. felt secure &amp; met some nice people. would recommend :)
Egypt,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,4,6,6,6,the only good thing about this hostel is the location. the room was smelly and super hot and bathrooms weren't that clean. 
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,6,6,10,"a fantastic location, you step right out onto the walk of fame. unfortunately the staff weren&amp;#39;t very helpful and didn&amp;#39;t even have a map to give us. the curtains in the room were thin as paper and the sun streamed into our room very early.  breakfast was very yummy!!"
England,Male,25-30,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"compared all the hostels i stayed this one is terrible, definitly go and stay down in santa monica area, wifi is terrible, not clean at all, not cosy, impossbile to meet anyone, very expensive compared the facilites they offer! for the same price you can fins smth much better! this was the 7th hostel i stayed in in 10 days because of my trip! do not recomend to anyone. the location is also dodgy for going out at night!"
Canada,Male,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"overall, i enjoyed my stay at the hostel. the location was excellent and right in the middle of the action. they offer day trips and a few night activities for the guests. the showers were not the greatest as it was hit or miss (choosing the right shower with hot water). the other thing was the wifi. this kept going in and out and there were many times it would not work for periods of time. the beds, washrooms and the facility were very clean and the staff was friendly. i will definitely go back"
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"the hostel is centrally located in hollywood, across the street from a subway station and at walking distance from the hollywood bowl. the staff is terrific: they are very friendly and eager to help. my only complaint, which i expressed to them, was related to noise caused by some guests at night. the staff promised they would work on enforcing their internal quiet hours policy. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was great and the staff was friendly and helpful. great spot!
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,my experience was awesome. it was my first time in california and the staff was so friendly and knowledgable. i was also travelling alone and felt really comfortable and the common area was really social. the hostel is also in the most perfect location on the strip and very easy to get to via public transport. i would definitely recommend to anyone 
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"best location, right on the main intersection of highland and hollywood, all the main attractions are right there. staff is super friendly and helpful and especially caesar at front desk. the activities organized by hostel are great. i did 3 tours with hostel, and grant did a great job. very easy to meet new people and make new friends. breakfast is also decent. i would highly recommend staying here."

Switzerland,Female,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,10,8,6,perfect location and great atmosphere. staff offers a lot of different activities. rooms are big and have a lot of space. cleanliness could be better thou especially in the shower room. stayed there for 6 nights and really enjoyed it.
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was perfect.. perfect staff and perfect room
USA,Female,25-30,8,10,10,4,8,8,6,10,"the showers were hot but don&amp;#39;t expect much privacy- the women&amp;#39;s restroom had curtains that were supposed to suction to the wall- but none of them worked. so, any woman walking by can basically see in the sides of the shower. obviously i can&amp;#39;t speak for the men&amp;#39;s room. the beds were fine. also, this isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; hostel. there were a lot of older people staying here. i personally didn&amp;#39;t like the location because hollywood boulevard is sketchy. "
Canada,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,4,2,10,6,"best spot for tourist.  men&amp;#39;s shower is kind of a joke , only 3 showers for all the men and it&amp;#39;s cold water !!! headoffice people kinda rude .. wifi is a piece of ***. i didn&amp;#39;t be able to check in my flight..   for a hostel that big you need at least great showers and wifi come on..  def not going again"
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"location is key, literally in the heart of hollywood which is what i wanted! i actually work in a hostel so know how cleaning a hostel goes and i felt it lacked just a little but due to the size i can kind of understand this. but us women can be messy regardless!

USA,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,6,8,make sure that you bring your international passport to check-in.
England,Male,31-40,6.9,8,6,10,6,6,6,6,great location right on hollywood boulevard.  stayed in a private room which had a comfy bed and a fridge.  shower could have done with an update but did the job
Indonesia,Female,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,10,8,"you should add hot water, we're freaking cold when showered."
Italy,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"everything good,.. a part from 2 days with cold shower.."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,6,8,"great location right on the hollywood strip. the building was clean and the staff was friendly and accommodating. the breakfast is below average, just beagles and muffins. but it was included with the price so i am grateful for that. the building is 2 stories with a mens restroom on the 1 floor and female on the 2nd. a little annoying but manageable."
England,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel, friendly staff and a good free breakfast. would recommend the hollywood sign walk. would stay again quite happily."
Italy,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"perfectly situated in front of redline-station, bus stops, main attractions and life of hollywood. everyone at the hostel is helpful and very friendly bringing a good mood! look out and enjoy hostel activities or hiking.  i'll definetly come back!"
England,Male,41+,4.9,2,6,10,4,2,4,6,"i stayed three times because of its location! telling you exactly what i’ve seen! good location, just by the metro station, free walking city tour/hollywood sign with amazing tour guide. some of the staffs are so rude and no respect at all. shower is already a disaster (lukewarm or cold, no water pressure in shower). no storage room! old windows that street noise is very loud day and night! so you can’t have a nice asleep at all. the price for the quality described is so high!! not recommended"
USA,Female,25-30,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,8,"hollywood is such a weird place, during the day the location was great, but at night it felt a little sketchy. bring an eye mask to sleep because the curtains are very thin and the street lights outside are very bright."
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hostel, awesome  people and awesome activities !"

SouthKorea,Female,25-30,6,4,4,8,6,6,6,8,good location 
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"the location is really great - it's right at the heart of the hollywood walk of fame. but that's just what leads to the hostel's biggest problem: there is very much noise coming from the street all day (and night) long and also some guests didn't care about the rest times so there was also noise coming from inside. but with ear plugs it was ok. the breakfast also was ok but could have been better (very limited choice). there are guided tours or events every day, which is great."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was happy to stay in here. you are so kind to me. and i like programs. hike to hollywood sign and paly game at night.
Canada,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,8,8,i was a great first experience going to the holly hostel. enjoyed myself and my time there.
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"dorms should have a better security system, other people in my dorm insisted in leaving the door unlocked so anyone could get inside.  also breakfast hours ends too early, people who wants to get a little more sleep were in risk to only have a bagel and neat coffee because there is no reposition of the items through out the breakfast hours."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,very convenient and easy. great location and nice accommodations.
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i had a great time. great vibe and atmosphere, i met so many people from all over the world. the location is so great, right across the street from the train station for the metro red line, as well as the bus to go to interesting parts of town. there's group activities that the hostel facilitates to help meet new people. the place was also really clean. i never felt unsafe, and there's a sense of community it seems like. i'd definitely recommend, and come back if in ever in the area again."
NewZealand,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"the best location you could ask for. right opposite a metro station so you can easily get anywhere. down points are that the bathrooms and cooking area are not big enough for the amount of people staying at the hostel. note, a lot of long term stayers here. not just travellers. but hostel staff are amazing and make you feel welcome :)"
Israel,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,10,10,4,10,atmosphere could have been better. maybe because there are too many people in the hostel. but nice hostel in total!
Germany,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"the hostel lies on the main street of hollywood right opposite the subway. the location is good however pretty noisy. the room, the bed, the matress and the lockers in the room were absolutelly ok. the bathrooms were however busy and not always clean. the free breakfast was just bagals/toast and butter, chees or jam. disappointing was that the hostel didn't provide any towels."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,4,8,10,6,not enough hot water to supply at least a warm shower.  otherwise great place with nice breakfast!
USA,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"nice hostel located right on hollywood blvd! the rooms were spacious enough, felt safe, lockers in the room (provide own lock), and the showers most of the time were lukewarm or cold. overall we enjoyed our stay and would come again! "
Malaysia,Female,41+,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,"its a good location. overall, its been pleasant.  however, if the hostels can improve in 2 areas, it will be better. have hot water and cleaniness of the place. the staff clean the restroom and mop the floor everyday!! good. but what makes the place dirty is the people who stay there. tissues are thrown everywhere. may be, the hostel needs to set some rules."
Poland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"i liked that it's just at the walk of fame, really close to everything. the best part about my stay were daily activities organized by the hostel - like hike to the hollywood sign and many others. but: there is only four showers in only one female bathroom for the whole building - wake up very early if you don't want to wait in line. also, no hot water already at 7:30-8am, so i don't know how early you have to wake up to have a nice shower during which you don't shiver."
Taiwan,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,4,10,10,6,"the location is great (with access to metro subway n bus, food, and bars!) they hold some free hiking tour that we can get to see the nice view of la and meet new friends! clean inside the room but a little bit messy in the common area. a little bit few shower rooms and toilets."
India,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"very good vibe, there was beer pong and we went out for drinks later. location is unbeatable, right at the center of the hollywood boulevard. everyone was friendly ad helpful."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,4,10,8,6,i never got hot water when taking  shower.
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,6,10,8,10,10,10,"the tours offered were well ran. the atmosphere was great. security was a little sketchy, but i was fine. the woman's bathroom ran out of toilet paper. but the experience was amazing and i met some great people!"

England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,4,10,8,8,6,8,door was left unlocked and open during our entire stay.  showers were cold at all hours
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome. it was super easy to connect to awesome folks. thanks samesum, i will come again."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,10,2,8,10,6,four mens showers for two floors of dormitories was far less than sufficient. and i did't have a hot shower for the entirety of my stay.
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,cesaer was an incredibly helpful and wonderful part of your staff. truly made the my experience fun and unique. thanks for a great time!
HongKong,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,common bathroom. breakfast is okay. security is rather poor. everyone can get in. they have luggage storage after check out but its actually just an open area where anyone have access.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i basically just used this hostel to recover from a 25 hour flight and see the boulevard before leaving la. bed was comfy, other guests in the dorm knew the rules and were quiet when coming in and the street noises weren't too bad. i didn't really want to meet people as it was a quick stay and people were friendly enough to approach but also would give you space."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,great location and lovely staff!
USA,Male,41+,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,"the rooms smell old and a little funky. considering the hostel's right in the heart of hollywood, you can't beat it! i enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. they really could work a little harder of the free continental breakfast?"
England,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,great place. very clean and welcoming! showers are great too! but very far from where our room was (the girls) which was a nightmare!! other than that was great!
Azerbaijan,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel ever! so helpful staff, clean hostel with great breakfast in the heart of hollywood.  would advice to anyone who wants to stay in the center of hollywood for reasonable price and have great holiday. thank you guys..."

Brazil,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay at samesun hostel! they provided some tours for free and i enjoyed all of them. the common room has a good atmosphere to meet new people or work/study. the bedroom was wide and felt safe. the bathroom was always clean and not as crowded as i thought it would be. the only thing to complain about was the safety. anyone can get in. in my last night there, i was being followed by a homeless and i thought i would be safe in there but she got in with me and kept following me inside."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location was perfect. very easy to get to from the airport, and right on the hollywood walk of fame. the staff was friendly and helpful. the people staying in my room were kind. free breakfast, hot showers, no complaints. a bit expensive, but that's just la. i would stay there again."
France,Couple,25-30,4.9,4,6,8,4,6,4,2,"very dirty kitchen. no possibilities to make food confortable (no knives, no tools). coffee is awfull.  most of the thibgs are broken or in bad health (dryer, boiling water etc...)"

USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay at the hostel. it was in an excellent location, in the center of hollywood, it was very inexpensive, it was not too crowded at least in october when i was there, it was very clean, cleaning people were wiping sinks and washing floor at least daily, it was getting a new paint job, there were optional free activities organized i.e. hike to hollywood sign, or a night out to a bar, free wi fi, free breakfast and awesome people. what more can you ask?"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had the most amazing time! the most fun i have had on my trip, really fun and welcoming staff and so so much to do in hollywood! felt 100% safe and comfortable! great experience!"
Philippines,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,8,8,i had a very pleasant stay here. the staff were awesome and the location is unbeatable. it&amp;#39;s literally a stone&amp;#39;s throw away from the kodak theater.
USA,Male,25-30,5.1,6,4,8,2,6,6,4,bathrooms need new plumbing.

Philippines,Male,31-40,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,6,8,"the location is excellent and the breakfast (bagels and muffins) is commendable, at best. but the atmosphere is very clique-ish. hosteling in the us is generally worlds away from the inclusive environments you will find in europe or in asia."
Italy,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,thanks for moving me to another room quickly and easy
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,an excellent hostel to stay in! highly recommended!
Spain,AllMaleGroup,31-40,8,8,6,10,6,8,10,8,"the location is unbeatabel,right in the middle of hollywood blv.  the guys at reception were kind and helpful. i wouldn´t care to crash there if i come back to hollywood"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff were awesome with fun activities and hikes. clean facilities and big common room. i would return.
Austria,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,8,8,10,"the location was great. it is right on the hollywood blvd.   but the rooms don't have ac and by 40°c it's terrible hot without ac...  the staff was nice and the people are cool, though."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,10,6,staff very friendly and helpful! they made our stay in los angeles way more easier! the atmosphere was great too!  the facilities could have been cleaner and when we come in it smells musty      ac would be a necessity; 6 in a room when its hot its unbearable!!  breakfast was great!    overall i liked my experience staying there!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,staff here are brilliant and were willing to go above and beyond no only to ensure you had a pleasant stay with them but that your experience in hollywood was enjoyable. unfortunately there was no aircon and with numerous 40*c/104*f days during my stay it was rather warm in the rooms making sleeping rather difficult. their cold filtered water refilling stations were also empty 95% of the time which when it is that hot made many of us grumpy. however it is in a fantastic location!
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,6,6,4,8,6,6,8,"the hostel was very clean and comfortable, but the guests were very noisy even at 2:30 am and the clerk was not interested in enforcing quiet hours. there is also no air conditioning which made it difficult to sleep."
China,Couple,31-40,6.3,4,8,8,2,8,8,6,"as a hotel in 21st century, i surprisingly found out the room has no air-conditioning.    parking downstairs: $25 per night. parking under dolby theatre (almost one block away): $15 per night."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location! rooms were pretty big compared to others i've stayed in, bathroom was clean and had a separate changing area which came in handy.  only downside was the small kitchen but it was usable  overall a good hostel "
BritishVirginIslands,Female,31-40,7.1,8,6,10,6,10,6,4,"great location, friendly staff especially the blonde guy from chicago at reception (sorry forgot the name) who helped me a number of times with routes around the area.  washrooms aren't in good condition though and the bedrooms are so stuffy and smelly but acceptable i guess for the price you're paying. would be useful to have phones in the room to call reception as 2 drunken guys entered our room at 5am one night! location is good and close to the hollywood sights."
CzechRepublic,Male,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,4,8,8,6,excellent trips!
England,Couple,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,6,6,8,6,"good hostel right on hollywood blvd, can be loud at night with street performers but that didn't bother us too much! "
China,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,6,6,6,4,4,the bed is not very clean and there is something bad smell ！the workers are not very friendly and no air conditioner there so that very very hot those days！but the location   is well because it is hollywood star street，i bought a lot clothes there . if  some people like the location you can choose it but i will not come back this hostel……sorry
Argentina,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel ! i love everything! 
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,6,10,6,8,8,8,it is a average hostel facilities etc the staff are real good the place is clean and friendly. they have lockers but you have to buy a padlock which i can find annoying as i paid already so i shouldn't have to pay more for some security. i would over all say though you paying for the location as i don't think there are many so central in hollywood with this price.
Mexico,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,it was a nice place. great atmosphere but the showers are a bit dirty.
CzechRepublic,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i enjoyed my stay there. staff is very friendly location excellent and free breakfast was nice. i recommned this place
USA,Female,41+,6,2,8,8,2,10,2,10,"well, the good new here is that the staff was very friendly and acommodating but if we had wanted to stay in a ""sweat lodge"" this would not have been it!  l.a,. temperature was in the 80's and 90's most of the time of our visit and this hostel does not have air conditioning!  we requested another fan but never received it and for some reason, they took out the only chair we had in the room.  will never stay there again!"
France,Female,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,8,8,6,need to work better on cleanliness
Spain,MixedGroup,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"its a very good hostel for bagpackers, free wifi, free good breakfast... the people working there are very gently and help you in everything."
England,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,6,8,"great location, good size lockers, great bathroom area, a bit noisy due to good location, very hot no air con and could have more effort on events "
Austria,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,maybe a little too expensive. but we had an awesome stay
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,very well located!!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the place is in an amazing spot, in the middle of everything on the walk of fame! was only here for a night but it was a great place, would definitely recommend it! "
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,the staff was awesome. they were very helpful during check in and encouraged us to participate in their activities for the night. everyone seemed friendly. the only downside was that there was no air conditioning and los angeles in september is very warm. other than that it was a great stay.
Chile,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,8,8,6,please a/c in the room!!
Germany,Couple,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great place and atmosphere! right on the hollywood boulevards, which can be a bit shady, but it's mostly fine. second night, they've been filming right in front of the hostel, which was a nice experience. "
Germany,Male,25-30,5.1,6,2,6,6,4,6,6,i'm very sorry but you could think that a part of the staff is dishonest against their guests because one guest lost his cellphone and he didn't get real help. he was  ensured that a guest found his phone and a member of the staff own it and he has to wait on the reception. but although he calls every day he have to call later on. the staff didn't want to say what really happened with his phone.
USA,Female,41+,5.4,2,6,10,6,4,4,6,have sent a message and done a survey to samesun. there are too many issues to write here again.
Malaysia,Male,41+,6.6,4,8,8,4,10,6,6,too hot no aircon and window not open to let free ventilation!
Spain,Male,25-30,6,4,8,8,6,6,6,4,shared shoers were too dirty and the smell was horrible. any kind of privacity  it was really difficult to get a clean towel. they were tuning out of tiwels at any time!!  the room was extremely hot and noisy.  the services and the staff were really cool. even participating in games with costumers.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"couldn't ask for a better location. angela puts on a good night starting with beer pong. the hollywood sign tour was amazing. the staff also took us to the observatory to watch the sunset for no extra cost. really comfy mattress and huge bathroom. the rooms are a bit smelly and too hot to sleep. maybe have breakfast end a little later because after those wild nights there's no way i can be up by 9am 😉 had a great time, i recommend staying here!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,staff were amazing! great location so long as you like to be amongst everything!
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,"this hostel is great if you&amp;#39;re looking to stay in hollywood for a few days. we stayed 4 nights and were pleasantly surprised with the location! it is quite literally on hollywood boulevard. there are also a lot of activities that are arranged inside the hostel, activities such as free walking tours and comedy nights!  value for money is fantastic, breakfast is ok. if you&amp;#39;re travelling the states then i&amp;#39;m sure you will be bagel-ed-out by the end of it, every hostel had bagels for breakfast. "
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,6,10,10,8,great location! special thanks to angela; she was very helpful and fun!
Chile,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,8,2,6,4,4,you definitely need a/c if you have a hostel in socal.
Canada,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"great location, comfortable enough. there is no a/c however, which would be a great addition since its in the heart of the city. staff has always been helpful, while remaining distant sometimes. lots of people come and go. i would comeback for a 2 night stay to visit hollywood. "
England,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,6,8,"great location on hollywood blvd, right opposite the subway station. it has a very small door so not easy to see/find straight away. big, clean bathrooms but open windows so ppl outside could see in - weird. rooms were hot as there was no aircon and only one fan to share which i didn't like. good selection at breakfast and there was a hooters down the road. if there was aircon then i'd recommend but otherwise, too hot. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"stayed here for 3 nights in august. pretty decent value for money, most staff were very friendly and helpful. no ac in my 4 person dorm so we ended up sleeping with the door wide open for cross flow of air (still quite hot), but despite being on a fairly dodgy area (hollywood boulevarde) we felt safe to do so as the security is decent. quite a lot of street noise from our window but that is to be expected in the location. communal male bathroom was big, a little messy but staff often cleaning."
Canada,Female,25-30,6.6,4,8,10,6,6,6,6,excellent location but the place is way too hot and humid.
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very good location, can see the hollywood ave right through the window. the and bus stop very close, and metro station is right across the street.  staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are clean.   free breakfast is very good.  but no elevator, have to carry my suitcase all the way up."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,8,8,8,6,6,this was a nice place to stay for a few nights. lovely helpful and friendly people. can get a bit noisy as it is on such a busy street but really an amazing location. bring your own lock for using the lockers (if needed). helpful staff.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"well done, well run! international travel, and felt very at home."
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,great hostel but no air conditioning! rooms too warm.
Egypt,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,that was the best hostel i stayed in on my us trip! they should just put some rules for cleanliness and they would be awesome!
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,"one of the best hostels i've stayed in the coolest and most friendly staff, amazing location, could not have asked for anything better!"
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,8,8,6,8,"we spent 2 nights in this hostel, not much to do in la so i wouldn't recommend a long visit here. perfect location, car park near by. lockers provided in our 6bed dorm, free breakfast, no que for showers. "
England,MixedGroup,18-24,5.7,6,2,10,4,4,6,8,"this hostel is ok for one or two nights, i wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend staying longer. there are lockers in the rooms, however there is minimal security. one staff member who runs the trip seems to leer over the drunk girls and offers them rides with his&amp;#34;cousin&amp;#34;. he also has a fake british accent, which as a british person is very entertaining. really good location and the girls bathrooms are clean (shower pressure is great)."
Ireland,Couple,18-24,7.1,4,6,10,6,8,8,8,"disgusted with the fact a couple who can easily share a bed are made purchase two bed without ever and intension to sleep separately! breakfast, although free, was a embarrassing"
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really loved this hostel, everything was great that it looked like a hotel!"
Japan,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,6,8,8,2,"good. friendly staff, free wifi connection, and location is really convenient!"
SaudiArabia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed at samesun hostel last week and i think it was my best stop through out all my vacation it was a great hostel , great location and especially very lovely and helpful staff , big thanks for ibrahim for making things a lot easier and simpler for everyone ."
Brazil,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,8,6,6,6,"the hostel is good, but it could a more clean, the bahthroom was always dirty and wet. i noticed that the guests in this place have no sense of community. people never cleaned their own mess."
SouthAfrica,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an amazing stay. the hostel was my refuge from the craziness of the streets outside and served as a much loved hub for my stay in la. thanks to all the team for the great breakfasts and always being ready to offer advice, which went above and beyond what is expected."
England,Male,18-24,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,to put it simple do not stay here!!! rooms are messy and smelly. staff are useless is of the absolute minimum. items got stolen. after around the usa for three this is by far the worst hostel iv stayed in.
England,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,6,2,2,4,2,"most awful experience in a hostel in the us. staff: unfriendly and useless, didn't even get shown around they just sat behind the desk and gave us incorrect bus info. rooms: no aircon, stuffy, very very smelly and dirty, thin windows make them very noisey due to location. breakfast: about 10 plates for the whole hostel and big queues. toilets: very dirty and disgusting. common room: small for the amount of people staying. can't stress enough not to stay here. i cancelled my 3rd night do not stay"
China,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,location is wonderful. enjoy yourself at hollywood!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel has best  mattres, no joke, i've  ever slept on. i mean  for a hostel, my matress was excellent. (not thin)"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,8,6,10,2,6,6,8,"overall is was a good stay.  the shower was blocked and filled up with water but the bathrooms were fairly well maintained otherwise.  great location in you want to be in the centre of the hollywood craziness and close enough to runyon canyon to get away from it all and go hiking.  i think you should make it clear tax is added to the room rates, not included at the booking stage."
Singapore,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,good and fast checking in and out.
England,Male,31-40,4.9,2,8,10,4,4,2,4,"its extreemly hot and stuffy at night, the rooms arnt cleaned out properly.you dont have a key for the front door so have to buzz and wait up to 5 minutes just to get into the building. if your unfortunate to be in room 30 you will have to share with the most arrogant obnoxious guy you will ever meet, and to make it worse,, hes the 'activities' guy?? he has a total disregard for others.  stay at the venice beach one instead, there alot more friendly, a better set up, and its a lot cooler at night"
Argentina,Male,25-30,3.1,2,6,4,2,4,2,2,"it was like been at jail. the room was dirty, noisy, without proper ventilation. the place smells as if cleanliness and hygiene are not priorities. the neighborhood might look good on tv but in real life it shows racism, violence, and feels unsafe all the time. absolutely non existing value for the money paid. never again. not recommended if you are looking for a place to relax and have a good time."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,6,4,8,10,4,6,6,4,"unfortunately this hostel wasn't the best, not very clean. great location though."
Mexico,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,4,8,10,"nice place, specifically for the location! i recommend host here, absolutely. :)"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,4,10,8,4,8,8,2,great location and atmosphere! the general stench of human feces in the room wasn't very enjoyable though.  but hey if you don't have a sense of smell book ahead ;)
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,4,6,10,4,4,6,4,"the lack of air conditioning in mid-summer was expected from previous reviews  however, the bathroom facilities were well below standard - while renovations were being done on oneside (which i completely understand has to be done for improvement) there was nothing but a sheet between the workers and showers - which would have been fine but there was no shutters or blinds on the bathroom window which openly faced a lane with visible public view - so it seemed either way you were exposed."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,4,8,8,6,"comfy beds and clean rooms. the bathrooms, however, were not good. of the four showers, three of the cubicles were missing their curtains (two were added while i was there) and there is nowhere to put your towel or clothes while you're showering so you just had to hang everything over the top, or outside the shower which was wet. the big open window also looks out onto the street so people can see you getting changed. needs a curtain?? could definitely be cleaner too."
Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,10,8,6,"when we checked in, the staff seemed a bit annoyed and there may be good reason for this. to enter the hostel, you have to be buzzed in. for the person trying to enter, it can be hard to hear the bell amidst the noise and ramble on the street. as a result, some staff members were observed yelling into the microphone with disdain. in the days following our checkin, the staff was very helpful in suggesting attractions and assisting with travel."
Netherlands,Male,31-40,6,10,4,6,6,6,2,8,"stayed here having lived the venice location.  staff weren't as friendly, all of the fire escape doors were open all night, seemed like it would be easy for someone to break in"
France,Female,18-24,5.4,4,10,6,2,8,4,4,"the hostel is old, and in general it smells bad. the bathrooms were not clean enough, and i think that the facilities are quite old."

Brazil,Male,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,10,8,8,8,"the hostel is great, the people, the environment, the rooms, the unique problem is the noise from by the street, but the rest is cool."
Portugal,Female,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,it was ok but to loud and toilets were not that good but wasnt that bad and location was good!
England,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,4,6,4,6,"the location of this hostel is its main selling point, if you don&amp;#39;t mind the hussle and bustle of hollywood blvd at night. i felt there was a real lack of atmosphere here. as a solo traveller i wanted to meet people and get involved in group activities, but there didn&amp;#39;t seem to be any effort here to incentivise this. not a terrible place by any means, but there are better places in the vicinity. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i really enjoyed staying at the samesun hollywood. free pool table, free breakfast, great location, staff was lovely. it was under reservation while i was there in the summer (july 2015) but it was still a delight, not really a disturbances. it will be awesome place to stay when the reservations are complete. thanks samesun hollywood "

USA,Female,41+,6.6,6,6,10,6,6,6,6,"women's bathroom-curtain was what separated the construction workers and the woman's bathroom?workers could see in-male staff member came into women's bathroom to change paper. did not call out &amp;wait for women who were in shower naked-to call out&amp;say it was ok to come inside. he just said""i'm coming in"" &amp;entered.i went down stairs to tell people at front desk-they had excuse that there wasn't a woman to do it &amp;yet there was one at desk when i went to tell them?"

Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"cool hostel, right in the middle of all the hollywood action. i liked the common room with the free pool table."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this is your typical samesun hostel, maybe even a bit better! they run really good communal things like hikes and taco nights which were good. clean too. great location!!!"
Thailand,Female,25-30,5.1,4,2,10,4,6,6,4,"it was my nightmare staying there. especially,the shower time!!  no door for the shower room, just some sheets and didn't even have any hanger for hanging my stuff. terrible blanket / dusty bed. won't go back again."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,4,8,8,6,"common room was great, rooms weren't great, my 4 person dorm only had one power point in it, it was also very hot in the room as well"

Bulgaria,Male,18-24,3.1,4,2,8,2,2,2,2,poor atmosphere. too noisy. staff is not cool.

Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wicked location. everything i wanted to see was in walking distance. all around great experience.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great location right in the heart of hollywood perfect if you want to see the sights and be able to walk everywhere. staff were great although can be noisy at times but this is expected due to location. would definitely stay here again.

Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,8,2,6,8,good location and facilities were good. brittish man running the place was very rude and arrogant.
Australia,Male,18-24,6,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,"the staff didn't seem readily willing to help you out, nor did they seem to do a lot. many of them sat around during the day in the living room and weren't too friendly when i did try to approach them. a friend and i went downstairs to have a cigarette and his phone was stolen within 5 minutes."
Taiwan,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"awesome and nice staffs. great location. very good atmosphere! its hard to find any better hostel in downtown hollywood. the only wtf experience is that there are only one outlet hidden behind the bed on wall with two plugs in my room where four people share. just put aside that, its pretty good experience living there. lastly, it will be better if there is cereal in breakfast as its quite plain to only have toasts"
Belgium,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"comfy beds and great location. free pool table was a bonus &amp; fun to play our own music in the common areas.  the free breakfast was pretty basic with toast, fruit and tea and coffee. really enjoyed the hike up runyon canyon with aaron :) convenient, clean and safe."
HongKong,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"everything was perfect, spacious room convenient location   but i don't know why they arranged a man to live in a female only room on the last night of my stay"

France,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,8,4,8,4,2,"the room floor and the shower were dirty. lots of hair clog the shower. not a lot of space in the shower to put your clothes, only one bench to share with other people.   the breakfast were disappointing. there were no paper towel and bread left, i had to ask the staff."
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,10,8,"location, location, location! same sun is fantastically situated while it also boasts a very chilled out vibe and laid back staff. a grunge look echoed throughout the property, cleanliness ticked all the boxes, while the room was  simple and pleasing.the common room / hang out space  was really good. a modest  free breakfast was offered (white bread, oranges &amp; coffee) &amp; tea available round the clock.  the  main thing that could be improved on would be staff more recommendations &amp; maps from staff"
Scotland,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,6,10,"great hostel, wifi in all th areas would let the common area be more social or doors for th common room so pool can be played longer would be fun! apart from that great hostel. everything very new and clean and perfect location"
China,Female,25-30,3.4,2,4,8,2,2,2,4,"this is the worst hostel i have ever stayed, i was arranged into a staff' room when i checked in, then later the reception changed the room for me. when they gave me a new room, they gave me the wrong key, they changed, then again the wrong key, the third time, the staff went to try another key with me, but didn't work. up to my checking out, i didn't have a key with me. the breakfast ended up very early, 9:00am, when i arrive in the kitchen on 8:55, nothing left. we wait for one hour, crazy"
Canada,Male,25-30,5.1,6,4,10,4,6,4,2,very bad hostel. very dirty and noisy
Malaysia,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,excellent location at hollywood. rooms are clean and comfortable. staffs are helpful. this would be a good choice if you're planning to stay in a hostel at hollywood.
Spain,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,nice hostel in a cool location
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,amazing location. it's situated directly on the hollywood blvd. it's easy to reach the most important places with public transportation. the staff was really friendly and helpful. the atmosphere was amazing because of a busy lounge. had a great time.
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,4.9,2,8,8,2,8,4,2,very noisy even during quite hours and i am not talking about the noise of the street but some music coming from the lounge. no one came to take our trash for 3 days. bathrooms were not disgusting but very uncomfortable to use because the showers only had curtains.
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"samesun is the best location for you if you're looking for a place in hollywood. it's close to the metro station and the famous walk of fame is just on your doorstep, so all major hollywood attractions are within walking distance. i was staying in a spacious 6 bed dorm and there wasn't one single time i was queuing neither for a bathroom nor a shower. the staff at reception is helpful, you've got a basic breakfast and it's a good place to meet people - what else do you need?"
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,8,8,10,10,10,"i think breakfast should be better, it would be nice to have more of a selection. not just bread and butter! there's a lot of people staying there who are hungry and at most time in a budget. the portions provided to residents isn't sufficient."
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,carlos was super helpful!
Canada,Female,18-24,4.3,6,6,4,4,4,4,2,"overall negative experience. the hostel wasn't clean at all, the rooms were incredibly hot and the beds were falling apart. there is a club nearby so if you can fall asleep with music shaking the floors, you'll be fine. on top of that, there were wet boxers in my bed, so i can imagine the bed wasn't changed. don't stay here!"
Colombia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"the hostel personally to me was great, amazing location right in the middle of hollywood, i could see the hollywood stars from my room. also it had a real hostel vibe to it, but my friends would've preferred it a tad more modern but i liked it. it's kinda of a younger crowd hostel"
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great hostel located in the center of hollywood area. always clean, not much noise, i really enjoyed my stay"
England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,4,8,8,"has potential to be a great hostel soon, give it a month whilst they transition ownership, complete renovation/decoration and embed a activity program...sure it will be no. 1 in la. amazing location right opposite chinese cinema/walk of fame/hollywood blvd/ hollywood&amp;highland metro stop "
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,6,10,10,6,6,4,8,"great location fairly clean common areas, very clean bathrooms some staff were friendly although most were in their 'click' no actives  no vibe"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,6,10,8,"beds were a little uncomfortable, but location was great and security was adequate. the communal area was nice and easy to socialise with everyone!"
Thailand,Male,18-24,8,10,10,8,6,6,6,10,"the hostel is located in the centre of the hollywood right across the metro station, the door to the hostel is very small therefore look carefully. the staff was okay, they know their job. i never get an opportunity to eat their breakfast, heard there were a lot of dramas about pancake that day. there are a lot of room in this hostel so probably get a room for your self in a 6 bed room. i will go back there again. "
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,6,4,8,6,"the overall atmosphere was awful but is now much more friendly and social. the new mattresses and breakfast are also a big improvement. however, there is still major room for improvement. there is one guy with a fake british accent; i think his name is louis and he is from nigeria or somewhere who constantly harasses girls and attempts to get investment from people for some app. he creeps everyone out. another guy on reception is nice enough, but has some cousin that is a creep!"
Norway,Male,31-40,6.9,4,6,10,8,8,8,4,"bathroom and shower area could be much better! needs deep cleaning or remodel,  otherwise pretty nice stay."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,10,6,8,"this is in the hollywood! i think this hostel need activity kind staff, however, no parking lots"
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had an amazing time at samesun hostel hollywood blvd.  the staff is very nice, met a lot of backpackers and the rooms are clean. i'd stay there every time again!"
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location with awesome staff! everyone was super friendly, met some really cool people there! i wish my stay would've been longer than just one night! i can 100% recommend the samesun hollywood! "
Canada,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,6,8,great location. like the classic hollywood-themed murals.
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location right on hollywood blvd combined with big, clean rooms and bathrooms makes this place a great hostel. staff were always super helpful and nice. loved the free pool and the vibe of the common room. defs will be back."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,cool hostel in a great location in the center of hollywood right opposite the metro station. we loved our stay at samesun venice 
China,Female,25-30,7.4,8,10,10,6,6,6,6,good deal.
China,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,in holland centre!very cool and convinience!
Sweden,Male,25-30,6.3,8,4,10,6,4,6,6,"you stay here for the location, that's all. the hostel itself is a little worn out and the staff is a bit confused and slow.    see the rest of the review here: http://www.tripadvisor.com/showuserreviews-g32655-d119471-r286071973-samesun_hollywood-los_angeles_california.html#reviews"
China,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,a little bit noisy in the night. 
Colombia,Male,18-24,6.6,6,8,6,8,4,6,8,"expersive, bad location and poor breakfasts  "
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"very good hostel. staff were helpful and friendly. wifi was very on and off. other then that brilliant accommodation, great cooking facilities and the living area is a great place to meet people. the hostel holds brilliant events in the week. highly recommend, i would definitely go back."
USA,Male,25-30,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,bed didnt come with a pillow...  
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,8,8,8,10,"-front desk staff were consistently clueless, but nice enough. wifi wasn't working on the computers one morning and there was no coffee for an extended period of time at breakfast. the staff couldn't have been more lackadaisical about addressing the issue"
Canada,Male,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,10,8,8,10,very good hostel with nightly activities.    pros  -nightlyactivities where you can meet others  -clean  -good location  --good common areas    cons  -some daytime activities would be nice to have in addition to the nighttime ones
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,10,6,6,6,6,"i lost my id prior to arriving at banana bungalow, the front desk attendant was gracious enough in dealing with dilemma but seemed incapable of offering any help without the manager. i had several options for verifying my identity but was told the best they could do was offer me a bed for night. i sat in their front room for around 4 hours before i was told i could stay for the night and met with many odd looks from staff members who seemed quite aloof and despondent. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,"overall my stay at banana bungalow west hollywood was nice, clean and good value for money. it seemed quiet at the hostel, but apart from that it was ok."
England,Male,25-30,6,8,6,6,6,4,6,6,"i found the staff very rude! not very helpful at all. clean enough rooms and communal area, we had a cool room with nice people in it! free parking which is really good for la! a hostel just for a few nights as a stop gap! "
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,10,8,10,8,"very nice hostel, grea tbreakfast. very friendly staff always ready to help. every week they organize activities in the hostel. the very relaxed atmosphere   109/5000  although it is not so close to tourist attractions, it is very easy to move"
Colombia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,10,4,8,4,6,10,other banana bungalow location is way better!!!! several people at reception weren't really eager to help....
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,"the staff here weren’t very helpful, they seemed bored every time i asked them a question. the hostel wasn’t really running any events even though they advertised they were, you had to travel to their “sister” hostel in hollywood. which was good, their events were fun (free booze too) but annoying to have to travel elsewhere. it was clean and comfy and other travellers were friendly. i would stay here again if the hollywood hostel was booked out. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,4,10,10,the receptionist wrote my credit on a paper and said it was their policy. was kind of sketchy to me.    other than that it was  nice
USA,Male,41+,8,10,8,10,4,10,6,8,"the only reason for the low rating on facilities is, the bathtub/shower water was always on the cool side "
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,"all the staff were friendly and helpful. they have an event each night of the week, with free food and drinks which was great. good location for some things, but a little distant from the “hustle and bustle”.  would definitely recommend it for those on a budget or ok with public transport/uber/taxis to get around. "
Canada,Male,31-40,4.9,4,6,6,4,6,4,4,wasn't too impressed.. the facility was pretty old and warn down.. i have stayed in many other nicer hostels in california for the same price.. 
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,8,8,"plenty of things to do in the evenings, although unfortunately i missed the events i wanted to attend because i came the wrong days lol easy access to get anywhere (lots of things within walking distance), very friendly staff and the people staying were pretty cool too. an awesome experience, even has a huge kitchen accessible to everyone. car park a little hard to spot, but that made me feel safer about leaving my car there. lot of gays :p "
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"perfect location! seems like a sketchy area at first but it's not, some staff members were super nice but one in particular seemed like he hated our guts lol. not a lot to do in the hostel itself and it's kind of junky but if you're just looking for a bed and place to keep your stuff then it's great. vending machines suck though, every time we used one, one of our items would get stuck and we'd have to bother the front desk. other than that i would highly recommend for ppl on a budget!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"overall, this is a great place to stay, especially if you’re planning on staying in weho for the majority of your trip. the rooms are cleaned daily, and the public balcony and outside areas are really nice. there are plenty of restrooms as well. i’m not sure about previous reviews, but the staff in my opinion were pretty cool. i didn’t ask many questions, if any, and was able to check in my room at 9am. i would recommend this place to anyone looking to save a few bucks in west hollywood."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the premier hostel in hollywood. private room is the way to go, $100/night in la w/free parking and breakfast. great activities throughout the week! we live in central california and can have an amazing time in la by coming here. best kept secret in la!"
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,6,8,friendly staff and good location. 
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i just stayed in a private for one night, but i was really happy with my choice. the room was huge, and the bed was really comfortable. they had free secured parking, which was very convenient. only downside was checking out was kinda tough because i was trying to leave early and even though it says 24/7 reception, they had the blinds down and the door closed so i felt a bit awkward trying to get their attention. like i said, it was super early though so i understand, everybody needs sleep!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,6,8,6,10,8,"a 15 minutes walk from the hollywood walk of fame, the banana bungalow is a medium sized, cozy hostel. the staff are ok, but they do their job so no complaints there. the decor is nice but the atmosphere was what made this place special. perhaps it was due to the free food and alchohol they provided for thanksgiving, but i had a lot of fun talking, playing ping pong and drinking with everyone there. being moderately clean and having a free breakfast make this hostel an easy choice."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,6.6,6,4,6,10,6,6,8,"it is really old hostel.  it doesn't have card key system. so they use real 'key' to open the door. thing is that it works in other rooms too.    the facilities are really bad, too.  also, there was no shower soap or shampoo."
Swaziland,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,6,8,6,8,2,very dirty. i good place for party people.
USA,Male,25-30,5.1,4,8,8,4,6,4,2,"i don't know if we just got a bad room but keep this in mind: they may say they do not allow long term rentals but they do. we were in a room with three other people and they had been there for weeks to months. a good judgement is the amount of shampoo left in their full size bottles, the shelves full of clothing, junk, empty beer cans, etc. we barely had enough space on the floor for our things. it was just a very bad experience and i would be very hesitant to stay here again. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,good hostel. i would stay here again. the location is perfect for all the attractions in la. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"great staff, slept alright (hard when you're tall). great being in the fairfax village. good lockers that you can put stuff in. only criticism is there wasn't much soap for the shower i was in."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the only thing that prevented a 10 was that they did not have a chair in the room to sit on....if you are sleeping on a top bunk you have no where to sit to put your shoes on or sit....other wise this is one of the best for the money and location.....as arnold would say, ""i'll be back.""    thanks to the friendly staff alex, laura and vile who made my visit memorable. "
Ireland,Male,18-24,4.3,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,"completely dead atmosphere, the towels we were given were dirty. the room was smelly and dirty and the location was far from ideal. the other banana bungalow hostel is much much better"
Canada,Female,18-24,6.9,8,8,10,8,4,6,4,"great location! room was nice and so were the facilities. only complaints are that the front desk staff always made it feel like it was such a burden if you had a question. also, i received dirty sheets and towels when i first checked in and when i brought them back to ask for clean ones the person at the front made it seem like i was being picky for requesting that instead of apoligizing? "
Argentina,Male,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,8,6,8,4,"the hostel has a great atmosphere and activities to meet fellow travelers. on the downside my room was dirty and the floor wasn't swiped during my stay and clearly hadn't been swiped in several days. the lady on the reception on friday afternoon completely killed my good mood, she was unpleasant, rude and condescending.   hostel is good, would stay there again"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,awesome place. got there at 9am and was able to have breakfast and leave my bags securely. 
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"our stay at banana bungalow was very comfortable. our friend got sick and had a bad fewer, they gave us a new room immediately!  the staff was very friendly and the location was good. it is easy to get to hollywood boulevard, walk of fame and santa monica beach.   they had nice activitys, for example free barbecue, stand up comedy or ping pong tournaments. it is easy to get to know other people because they have nice lounges where you can just hang out.   all in one we would recommend the bbh!"
Netherlands,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,6,8,10,"we had a clean, private room. streets can be noisy but it's la. the woman who checked us in was really lovely and helpful (sorry no name). the day after we asked other staff some questions about the public transport card and they seemed annoyed and were unhelpful. ''just pay cash'' when we specifically asked about the card isn't the answer.    hostel itself had a standard (but free!) breakfast and lots of fun activities. it's located in a street with lots of shirts-n-sneakers stores and the grove."
India,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,6,8,nice location in west hollywood. a slight disadvantage is they don't assign you a bed number and it can create a confusion. my bed was taken by some other guy. the breakfast can have a little more options. overall recommended.
Argentina,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing deal , good vibe. i highly recommend it."
Ireland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel it had such a friendly atmosphere, it was very clean, breakfast was good and above all the staff made this a special place. friendly willing to help from giving directions to attractions to organising events to mixing with hostel stayers. there was evening entertainment most nights food drinks and music, by far the best hostel i have stayed in in los angeles!!"
Israel,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,total worth for money. staff were great. and everyday they have some kind of activity. i found people to hang with
Australia,Male,31-40,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,8,enjoyed my stay looking forward to the next visit
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel with friendly staff and an amazing atmosphere. the rooms and internet were good, but the best thing about this hostel were the activities. monday night we were invited to a free bbq (with burgers and beers) and stand up comedy, which was amazing. the communal area also has table tennis and pool tables, so a good way to meet new people."
India,Male,25-30,7.1,6,6,8,6,8,8,8,"the hostel is located at a convenient location near the hollywood blvd. the beds aren't very great. the one i was given made too much noise on the slightest movement. making your own bed, especially if it's the top bunk can be a task. their biggest plus point was the parking space included, makes life so much easier. "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,pretty chill and nice hostel - apparently they have some decent parties when joining up with the other banana bungalow but wasn't around for that. clean and safe place to stay
England,Female,25-30,6.6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,not far from main hollywood. beds were difficult - very old and rickety. bathroom dated. staff were bit abrupt
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great place to stay for a small amount of $$$. i will recommend to anyone who asks. a+
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"lots going on most nights and it's for free.   everyone is friendly who stayed at the hostel, great value for money if your stopping in la "
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,excellent stay from start to finish. niall in particular was amazing. he went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy and involved in the activities.  free breakfast was a bonus. we had a late flight and they let us use the facilities during the day even though we had checked out. we really enjoyed the evening activities which were really good value for money. overall a very laid back and well run hostel.
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay in la
Ireland,Male,25-30,3.1,4,2,6,2,2,4,2,"the building itself is really run down and seemed to come with a lot of issues - warnings on toilets, vending machines out of order and showers with no hot water and weak pressure.   cleanliness was pretty bad. it looked like the drain in the shower hadn't been cleaned in days and there were items that belonged to previous visitors still in the rooms   at night they didn't have ppl on reception to help when cars were blocked in. the tow company required their authorization but no one available."
England,Couple,25-30,5.4,6,4,4,6,4,6,8,"we stayed there for three nights and were only given the code to get in the building on the second night. this is despite asking them at check in if there was a code to get in, and they simply told us someone would be at reception till 12. front desk staff seem unenthusiastic and grumpy. no night guard on third night, didn't feel like a secure building. close to sunset strip which is a plus for those wanting to go to the comedy clubs. clean, cheap, nice kitchen staff no, but not a buzzing hostel"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is my home away from home when i'm in la. it's located right in west hollywood, close to all the shops and restaurants. the people working here are always so kind and attentive. love that this place has parking spaces underneath. furthermore, the events held every night are always fun and the morning breakfast, while not grandiose, is a nice way to start your day. definitely worth the money. will be staying here again in the near future. love it! "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location and helpful staff. free breakfast was okay. not a lot of space to store bags in dorms but laundry was cheap :) 
SaudiArabia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,parking is too small 
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place! great location, nice clean rooms and great atmosphere. staff has many events and free breakfast and the guests aren't loud or obnoxious. they also have free parking. would definitely recommend! "
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,6,10,8,10,8,"not a bad stay at all, the other banana bungalow seemed like it had a slightly better atmosphere, but we chose to stay here due to the parking facilities being limited at the other hostel. all in all not a bad place to stay, great people, great vibe, and very affordable!"
USA,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,the staff / hostel itself is awesome. they could cut back on enabling loud drunken kids.
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"favourite hostel of our trip so far, the hollywood one was a better location but we preferred the vibe of this one!! the nights organised by the hostel were really good fun, free drinks and delicious food plus great atmosphere. niall made our stay, even if he does look more like rafe spall than ryan gosling.... 100% recommend staying here if you're in la, absolutely loved it!! "
Scotland,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,i really enjoyed staying at the banana bungalows. the bathroom within the dorm room was an added luxury compared to some of the hostels i have stayed in. the dorms were clean and comfortable. the entertainment provided was very good too. 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is more then i excepted it to be - it was clean, the staff was friendly (which i personally would like to give a shout out too, lauren, angie, nile, augstina, gabby, eyvlen, fucando, marina, matt, sorry if i missed your name) but everyone was so nice! the cleaning staff came everyday and cleaned my room. this hostel is not like any other, food is provided literally every night, breakfast is provided every morning.    literally the best neighborhood - walking distance to everything."
England,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,really enjoyed our stay at banana bungalow west hollywood. we found the location great as it was just one short bus journey into the chaos of hollywood but far enough away to be out of it when you want to be. the hostel offers 2 free meals a week through the activities - bbq definitely worth it. rooms are a decent size with an ensuite. staff were lovely on check in and keen to get you involved in all activities. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"fun place, great way to meet other travelers!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"safe location, nightly events, clean"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"simply put best hostel i've been to in the world (tops any european hostel) great facilities, gym,pool table,ping pong table, pooo table, outdoors hang out area with bar and downstairs area with another pool table and tv for late night/early morning chills. is right on fairfax and a few minute walk from melrose ave which are both shopping hubs!    they even through free dinners and events most nights of the week! shoutout to niall he's a legend and if you stay here go to canters deli 110% must !"
Ireland,Female,25-30,6.3,4,2,4,10,4,10,10,"we liked this hostel, but unfortunately our car was broken into in the hostel car park, as well as 2 other cars, despite voicing our concerns that the gates should have been closed. the security staff were not helpful. "
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,just good good
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was great! we're returning to la at the end of our two week trip and have made sure to return here! the staff were really friendly and helpful. in the evenings there was always free food and entertainment. niall was amazing as he even waited behind to catch an uber with us so as to make sure we made it to he event that night as we were running late. all in all, 100% recommend this place, best hostel we've stayed in all trip. thanks! "
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,clean and secure place. staff very helpful and inviting.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing stay, best place to be. would definitely return. big shout out to staff member niall!! so friendly and helpful. make you feel very welcome and the activities provided are a great way to socialise and make friends! "
Lithuania,Male,25-30,6.9,10,8,8,8,4,6,4,"good location, unprofessional staff. if you planning on sightseeing its not your place, but if you looking for a party it should suit you! also cheap place, so in the end you get what you pay for! "
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,this hostel was nice - each room is ensuite and there was a spare toilet down the corridor which was great. the lack of plug sockets next to the bed was a bit inconvenient but the beds were comfortable and the communal areas seemed nice. it's hard to say if it's a good location because l.a is so spread out but the nearby dog shop which let you walk dogs was great and the free breakfast was always appreciated.
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,really awesome people there! had a positive experience :)
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,"this is the main hostel i stay in when im in la. great communal area both inside and out, nice staff and they organised some pretty lose shindigs throughout the week to keep everyone entertained! karaoke night gets the most lose imo.    "
Israel,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel with great atmosphere ! the people are great, friendly and the italian food is amazing ! every night you have events, some of them are free and some of them are 5$ - 20$ highly recommend and will comeback !"
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"lovely staff, clean, fun things to do there... 😊"
England,Female,18-24,7.1,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,a great hostel. quite good location. but no shops nearby about 10 min walk. free breakfast is good. if you're under 21 it's not as good as you can't enjoy the events they put on every night. $5 dinners / free bbq &amp; beer nights. some staff were nice/easy going but some were very rude. keep your personal items in your lockers as some of my things were taken &amp; reception told me it wasn't down to them. apart from that would recommend. 
Austria,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay here. they had a lot of great events going on in the evenings were you could meet people and had an awsome time!   if i ever come back to l.a. i will stay there again!!  recommend it to all!!
Mexico,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,8,10,"it is a very nice place, not expensive and well located."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a great stay here after only planning to stay for 1-2 nights i got attached to the area and the vibe and stayed for a week. really close to a lot of street wear shops flooded on fairfax and melrose including supreme if you're into that. the staff were really friendly i got along with most. in particular got to know jacquill pretty well who showed me around and was overall a legend who made my stay feel like home.  overall a great atmosphere. home cooked dinner, optional party most nights."
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is probably the best hostel i have ever stayed in. the staff are brilliant, the atmosphere is fantastic and the amount of fun things that the hostel put on are incredible. we had a free bbq and beer night - what is better than that?! the location is good - not the best but a taxi/uber to alot of destinations is relatively cheap. if it's a sunny day though you can walk to hollywood centre in around 45 mins. i cannot recommend this hostel enough. "
England,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"dirty building, cockroaches, indian lady on reception extremely rude, other staff not much better. poor security, a girl who wasn't even staying here would come in to our room, use our shower etc. be careful using credit card. this was one of two places i used mine and my details were stolen. overall bad experience."
Italy,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,6,10,10,"davvero un buon ostello : pulito, colazione abbondante e ambiente davvero accogliente ! certo bisogna avere la macchina per spostarsi ma a la è così ovunque ! lo raccomando ! "
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,10,10,4,8,8,6,8,make sure you don't go to the other banana bungalow hollywood. it took me forever to get to the other one from the airport only to realize that i had gone to the wrong banana bungalow and that there are two hollywood locations. have to say though the west location is better. the other hollywood one was quite sketchy at night and hidden between some restaurants i couldn't even find it
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"very nice place in the heart of hollywood. i stayed in the all girl's dorm, and all my roommates were really sweet and easy to get along with. i went to bed early and always got a good sleep. i recommend bringing earplugs because the noise from the courtyard is always audible inside the rooms."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful little hostel, right in the heart of la. "
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great hostel about a 15 min walk from all of the action. staff were extremely polite and helpful. breakfast was good, coin laundry on bottom level and the bathrooms were clean. would definitely staff here again in travelling to la on a budget. "
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"great atmosphere at the hostel, lots of social events organised by staff which allows guest to get to know one another. food provided in exchange for a tip, great value for money. "
Lithuania,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,4,6,6,8,8,super far away from everything and a pain to get to from the bus station. shops are pretty far too. general vibe not great in the common area(which is almost non existent for those looking) except the garden area where you're aloud to blast music or yell until 12 am or until someone complains (that is after 12).   breakfast was pretty good although when i asked if i could have it five minutes before hand as i had to catch the bus (cereal was already out there) i was refused.  met some great peoplethough
DominicanRepublic,Male,25-30,4.9,6,6,2,6,6,4,4,not bad for the price is u just gonna stay for one night but it far from downtown angeles and beach 
USA,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,actually not the best location and a staff member was pretty dang rude to me for being a paying customer. i don't really reccommend this place. perhaps it is the cheapest option for a reason. 
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,this place was great! something going on everynight. staff were friendly and helpful. good location. felt very safe. the free breakfast is a bonus! very clean. would definately come back and recommend! they offer shuttle services to most tourist attractions so thats handy. value for money. very happy with this hostel!! 
Canada,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,"facilities are a bit old, location was not ideal but relatively safe. great stay overall"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome staff!  friendly, hospitable, no attitude.  fair treatment to all guests. centrally located .  you are close to the farmer's market,  west hollywood, and most of l.a.'s attractions by foot or bus.  if visiting santa monica, beverly hills, or the beach area, you may need to rent a car.  i had a pleasant, peaceful, and fun stay. no complaints. thanks to great staff for being nice &amp; patient in a fast-paced nutty city .... a.k.a. ""hollywood"".     best wishes,  peter c.  u.s.a.  󾓦"
Canada,MixedGroup,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i stay here all of the time! it's in an awesome location, not too expensive and i've never had a bad experience in the 5 years i've visited this place. see it up!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"i loved stay at banana bungalow   staff was nice   best breakfast that i already had in all the hostels that i stayed!  they have a bunch of actives during the week  the only thing is that the bus don't stop on banana bangalow west hollywood it stops at banana bungalow close to the walk of the fame!!  if you intend to go buy bus, know that it is gonna stop at the walk of fame and you have to get a uber till banana bungalow west hollywood that will cost you between  $4 $7!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent hostel!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,great stay. location was great but the breakfast included wasn't great. more options would be preferred 
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8,6,10,8,10,8,6,8,hostel has good facilities and clean rooms. beds pretty comfy and kitchen is decent size. they organise some good night activities and staff were really helpful. little pricey but that's la. would recommend
USA,Male,25-30,5.4,4,4,8,4,8,6,4,''twas trashy. you get what you pay for. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"i'll start by saying that i didn't spend a lot of time at this hostel... my friend and i left during the day &amp; actually stayed with a friend elsewhere for 1 out of the 4 nights we were there. i reserved a 6 bed mixed dorm, but for the duration of our trip it seemed to be exclusively men. our overall experience was great- the beds &amp; bathrooms were good and the free breakfast was very convenient. while not immediately close to shops, its in a very central neighborhood with lots to walk to."
Russia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"nice place, helpful staff"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,10,8,great value for money. nearly every night of the week the hostel has some type of activity. providing free food and drinks.   half a block from a small supermarket where you can get all basics. or roughly at 15minute walk to the farmers market.
Malaysia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,"staffs are very friendly, location quite good and near to bus stop, activities provided by hostel are awesome, but the toilet's flush in room has a little problem"
England,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"staff really helpful and friendly, everything is exactly like the video on their website, pool table, ping pong, loads of activities, rooms cleaned daily and got enough sleep because other guests were respectful. locals restaurants and supermarkets in walking distance. highly recommended - would stay again."
Barbados,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my stay was awesome the staff was very friendly and helpful. the rooms were clean and the staff organised events are very fun. will go again.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was honestly the best hostel i've come across. ideal for socialising as they offer great events every night of the week and the facilities were great. it's in a really cool part of town and the staff are so friendly and make you feel at home. the rooms and bathrooms are spotless. would 100% recommend. 
Brazil,MixedGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,amazing hostel! only one guy who was working at the bbq was a bit rude. most of the staff were great. the van driver (an indian guy who i forgot the name) was amazing. the manager/owner was also very good. there was an argentinian girl called lucia who was an great person always helping around. loved it.
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,10,6,kind of a sketchy area but the security was good so i felt safe as a female solo traveler. place is kind of dingy and dirty but i only stayed one night so it was fine. bunks aren't very comfortable. i didn't get a chance but seemed like plenty of opportunities to meet people. 
USA,Female,31-40,8,6,10,8,10,6,8,8,good location close to the beverly center and west hollywood area. i drove and they have free underground parking so that was great. they have a bar/party area if you're into partying and a big area to socialize. internet connection was good. the only con is the sheets are cheap quality and too small. every morning i would wake up with the fitted sheet half off the mattress which was kind of annoying having to remake the bed everyday. 
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,very satisfied with this hostel. perfect for youth travelers looking to get in the mix of la. located well enough to reach everything you could need and would want to see. helpful staff and very fun common space make for a good spot to make lifelong travel friends. would stay again.
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,8,6,"the staff here were so helpful and the location was near everything. my friend and i were visiting from michigan on spring break so we were very happy with all the suggestions and useful info for all the attractions we wanted to do. although, we did find a couple bugs in our room (in which they immediately upgraded us to a better room), as well as the water being cold in our shower, we were really pleased with our stay. 10/10 recommend. "
Spain,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"hey,    it was an amazing hostel, with nice people and the staff was awesome!   "
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was an incredible experience  staying here. clean facilities and super friendly staff. i made some genuine friends here and connected with people from all across the globe. i would definitely recommend this place 👍🏾  and it's right on hollywood blvd. cannot beat that. 😉
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"this is a great hostel! fun crowd, great central location, clean, and they offer you tons of resources for helping you make the most out of your la stay. most nights they have fun activities planned in conjunction with the sister location on hollywood boulevard. staff is helpful and informative. the free breakfast is standard but welcome. affordable price and a really good value for your money. i'll stay again!"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a fun hostel! highly recommend staying at this hostel.
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"kind of old and dingy, but fine for a couple of nights. bunks are old and creaky and have no outlets or lights, not the most comfortable. definitely not on the level of european hostels. felt safe as a solo female traveler. bathrooms were clean. good location near shops and walkable to trader joe's/whole foods. as i said, probably wouldn't stay here for more than 3 or 4 nights. "
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.9,8,8,6,10,4,6,6,"in the staff the hostel has a man so bad in customer service. the only one who has a great customer experience is the girl that collects the name for the parties. the place is so far of the centre. hostel has good plans but i miss more interest in giving information for the tours. the cleaning is terrible in my room, i arrived and for three days it has a lot of dirtiness. only my last day the room was cleaned."
USA,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,4,10,2,6,8,location was a bit sketchy but not that big a deal. facilities were great - plenty of gathering space and available activities. breakfast offerings were basic. staff seemed detached and somewhat bothered and weren't enthusiastically suggestive of things to do. 
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,they offer free activities every night. they even had free unlimited beer one night.  i'd say you really get your money's worth. nice location even if it is a bit far from most attractions.
Australia,Couple,18-24,2.6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is by far the worst hostel i've stayed in. the location is pretty poor, the washing machines can only be used at night so you have to chose between clean clothes or their 'nightly planned activities', they only had 1 working computer which was used by staff to watch netflix, the tv did not work and when we asked for help the staff member accusingly told us we must've broken it, the hot water didn't work, and staff were far from helpful."
Australia,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay, very clean, large kitchen, great wifi.  close to everything with helpful staff.  and awesome social environment, hostel rubs daily events and shuttles   will stay again if ever back in la"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,10,6,8,8,my one night stay here was fine. facilities seemed pretty good and breakfast was sufficient. seemed well set up for activities and socialising with a bar and common room. i found people quite unsociable over breakfast but it was a rainy day so perhaps that affected the mood!
Australia,Female,31-40,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,"great place to stay, only thing is the water is not warm in shower and only one sheet for the bed not good during colder months other than that great place. "
Australia,Couple,31-40,8.9,6,10,8,10,8,10,10,"this is a pretty solid hostel, good wifi, kitchen, outdoor areas, ping pong, pool, tv in the rooms, lockers, individual showers, good beds and organised activities every night. could be cheaper, but hey it's america and you get what you pay for. you'll be happy here."
Canada,Male,41+,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i would stay here again. staff was helpful, desktop internet/computer and local calling was also helpful. i wish i had taken advantage of the shuttle parties to the west hollywood bungalow. nightly activities were fun and made it easy to meet others. don't forget to cook up a storm in their more than adequate kitchen. lockers in dorms were a nice touch. used the 780, 217 and 218 buses, plus the bus on melrose for downtown access. great restaurants in the area including canter's, aek ramen, etc."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"beyond all expectations.  they underplay how good it is as a hostel option, or even just a general option for staying a while in la."
France,Female,25-30,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,good hostel just not enough showers and bathrooms. cool staff and nice location 
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"really happy, lots of friendly people, kitchen was a little under maintained but facilities were good. yeah overall we had a pleasant stay."
Norway,Couple,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,8,8,6,"great location. staff is nice, but a bit unprofessional. the hostel smells bad. the breakfast is plain. over all a good place to spend a couple of nights. "
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is a really cool place to be, it's affordable (so long as you go for a dorm room) the staff are decent/fun people and the atmosphere is great, i checked in on the 15th for a 2 night stay but kept extending, mainly because of the amazing people i met at this hostel, in the end i stayed for nearly 2 weeks just partying and chilling with everyone, the lockers are small but big enough for valuables, 217 bus to hollywood takes 10minutes, nice clean place as well, i will be coming back!!!!"
Israel,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel! superb atmosphere, awesome facilities, comfy beds! "
Serbia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,"when in la it's very important to have your own car because the city is huge. from this hostel driving to santa monica is almost one hour, downtown 30min, hollywood 15min, weho 10min. beverly hills 30min, usually backpackers on a budget don't rent cars but a car (and uber/lyft) in this city is a really must. look at the priceline app for cheap deals. this hostel has underground parking and is close to weho which is the reason why i booked it. nice stay, not so super clean but it's ok."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,hostel world apply too much commissions and fee! is better to book direct without hostel world 
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,cool and clean well located place. it was so nice i just stayed way more them planned.
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,lots of bums around. walking around at night not an option. 
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,verry good
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very welcoming....clean...good people...good coffee   ideal location to get anywhere you want to explore
HongKong,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,10,10,8,8,"located in a quiet neigbouhood, one 10 minutes ride bus to hollywood blvd where the attractions are. facilities are incredible.staff are nice and funny. like that they have activites for guests in the hostel, easy to socialize with others. but the atmosphere is a bit party-like, still hear the noice of the hostel actibity at mid night in the room, might not be suitable for children or whom want to be quiet.the lower storey of the bunk bed is to small, can't sit on the bed."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,10,10,8,6,10,8,8,good place to stay in terms of having somewhere to sleep. the breakfast is awful and the atmosphere was okay. they took us out one night really far from the hostel and basically told us to find our own way back even though there was no taxis driving around which was very frustrating. staff was incredible when helping us find ways to get around and accommodating when the lock to our room broke. overall good place to sleep but that's about all. 
Turkey,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,6,10,10,10,10,it could have been the best hostel i have ever stayed at compared to about 20 others if i had not seen the huge rat in the kitchen in my last night.
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,staff was so friendly but the room was kina massy seems like some people live there for long time. it was not bad with cheap pice and good location in west hollywood!
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,8,10,"great location.  they had events organised every seconds night which was great. the staff could of been a little more helpful, some were great others just seemed liked they didn't want to be there. had a great time and would happily stay there again."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,really nice hostel. it may look a bit dated inside but it really didn't matter. the people were all really nice and able to help in any way possible.  i can definitely recommend this to other travellers.
USA,Male,18-24,8,10,8,10,10,4,6,8,"i love this hostel, this was my second time coming here and i love how close and accessible it is to the happenings of hollywood and west hollywood. it is often very clean and the people who stay can at times be hit or miss but this time all of my roommates were very friendly. the staff tends to be friendly most of the time as well, but this time while checking in i was greeted by the welcoming committee. dont tell people your moving to la otherwise your money isn't green and they wont renew u!!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i stayed here one night and loved that they had a private bathroom attached to the 6 person dorm, as well as fresh sheets/blanket/pillowcase per bed. the staff were very friendly, and there was a free parking garage to keep my rental car.     this location was close to a bunch of stuff in west hollywood, and i was satisfied with my stay.  i recommend this location."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.4,6,10,8,6,10,8,4,"pros: close to a bunch of shops, fun and helpful staff, fun area to hangout in, events thrown are fun   cons: dirty and very outdated, rooms were cramped, right beside a very busy street so sometimes it's hard to sleep    overall the experience was okay, but i expected to get a little more for my money's worth "
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff is very friendly, lovely and pro active, the place is cleaned constantly, kitchen is spacious and well equiped, also very clean  the elevator was broken while i was there, but no big deal as they have only one floor up."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.4,10,8,6,6,8,8,6,"cheap stay in l.a. nice atmosphere and many free drinks. not located at the best area of l.a., but close to many nice places like sunset strip or hollywood"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"out of all the hostels i stayed in america this by far had the best atmosphere.  there was some really good events held each night i was there at either the hostel or their sister one in hollywood which you allowed you to socialise with other travellers quite easily.  this was good as an alone traveller, and i met some really cool people which helped enjoy los angeles as i though the city itself was pretty ordinary."
Poland,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really felt comfortable in this hostel. great security, and locker facilities. the staff were amazing, throwing party nights on certain days; it was a lot of fun. the rooms and bathrooms were immaculate, and cleaned daily. facilities were awesome, fuzbol table, table tennis, large kitchen area as well as a really large kitchen with lots of fridges and a couple of vending machines. at midnight when the outdoor area closes, you can take the party in the basement hall."
Philippines,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,the best hostel stay i'd ever experienced. will definitely come back.
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was the best place i have ever had.
Ireland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place. safe, clean and great atmosphere because they have activities every night to get everyone together. "
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,staff was really friendly. generally a good experience. would also recommend to rather stay here than on hollywood blvd. probably the best hostel i've been in la in terms of value for money.
Japan,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,great! thanks!  especially for staff are so kind.
England,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"eventhough we were only there for a couple of nights they made us feel sooo welcome!   complementary beer on arrival with a free bar that evening then off to a pub crawl :).   although it isn't in the main area of where everything is, there are plenty of cheap buses that can take you there! :)   they also have lots of information of how you get to places from the hostel and even offer free lifts to places!! :)   we loved our stay and if we're ever there again will definitely be returning! "
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,10,6,"excellent location and free parking! i have stayed at various hostels in la and for around 30 dollars a night, you are not going to find a better deal.     some of the hallway lights had dead bugs that needed cleaning out and sometimes the hot water in the shower would not work but i have stayed here multiple times and have had a great experience.    if you are looking for fun group activities, this place is great too!"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,"this is a fairly okay hostel, does okay with the activities but half of them are at the other hostel in hollywood. the tiki bar is only open on event nights but you can drink in the courtyard. i found it quite frustrating that the bag hold was not secure. "
Israel,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,good place
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,8,8,"great hostel, super close to everything i needed, for a one night stay it was perfect - heaps of social events for those who arent sure what to do or travelling alone."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel! staff were great, there was a lively atmosphere and the facilities were excellent. highly recommend"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is a stellar hostel. you would be making a great choice by staying here. could not possibly ask for a better location, better facilities, or a friendlier staff."
China,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,6,10,8,8,"the bathroom is clean. however, it is too noisy...."
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,6,8,6,8,8,great hostel if you are a solo traveller as they have planned events every night which makes it easier for meeting other travellers. bed sheets didn't fit the bed i had so that was a pain. location is close to walk of fame but miles away from the beach. i'd recommend this hostel! 
SaudiArabia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"definitely i&amp;#39;d stay again, the people there are just so awesome and the atmosphere is so cozy!"
Japan,Male,18-24,6.6,10,8,6,2,6,8,6,"it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as the number shows, but not all in all good. more or less you just get what you paid for. since for just $30 or so, it did the job. one thing bothered me a lot is the designated parking lot fills up quick and there aren&amp;#39;t any spot outside the underground to park for carefree. that was one of the biggest factor, so i was very disappointed and made me nervous to get it towed "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,accidentally booked the wrong banana bungalow and they changed it straight away and put me in the same dorm as my friend. such a good vibe and everyone was so friendly and relaxed. thanks so much 
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,8,8,"my stay at the banana bungalow, west, on fairfax liin. in west hollywood,was everything i expected and more!  this was my first time staying at a hostel.  i was very pleased.  i stayed in a dorm room with 3 bunk beds and an attached suite with 3more bunk beds.  all of the women were quiet and respectful!!  i was interested to learn that  everyone was from all over the world ... switzerland, germany, france, australia to name a few.  the accommodations were clean.  highly recommended, reasonable."
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"i really love this hostel!   did not want to be in downtown la, and i believe this was te best choice.   pretty cool athmosphere, great staff, cool looking hostel and the location was pretty convenience.     if i ever go back to la, for sure i&amp;#39;ll stay there. "
England,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,8,8,8,10,10,"america isn&amp;#39;t that good at hostels in general, but this place was cool. plenty of activities on in the evening, and a good vibe created to meet other travellers. clean enough and good wi fif also. "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were very helpful, hostel was clean and the organised events during the evenings were great!"
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,"this was a great place to just chill. there are plenty of people around to meet and greet, but the rooms and the roommates are quiet so you can nap to your nap&amp;#39;s content. very chill, indeed."
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the hostel was centrally located and very clean. it was easy to find parking and the staff was very helpful!
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect hostel for the solo traveler. the organized events were a hoot. staff are lovely and provided a cheat sheet for the buses and trains to get around which was super helpful.  comfy bed and hot showers. 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"banana bungalows west hollywood were excellent, there is always something organised for you to attend and get your drank on or just chill on your own if thats your thing, the location was perfect, it was easy to get around and the area isn&amp;#39;t as crazy as being on, or near the hollywood strip.  also the staff are all pretty damn fine so thats always a plus ! "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay.  was welcomed with a nice cold beer after a long day.  thanks guys,  i would stay here anytime 👍"
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hotel in a great place with a really fun-friendly vibe! everything was clean, and they put on the best comedy show the night i was there. felt safe and in a great location of the budget traveller! "
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.3,8,6,10,8,8,10,8,"the banana bungalow west hollywood is one of my favorite hostels in los angeles, really good location, friendly staff and cool activities every night. not my first time in this hostel, definitely not the last :) "
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was absolutely awesome. 
England,Male,25-30,8,6,8,8,8,8,10,8,staff were really helpful and the showers were good. events make meeting people really easy. good wifi. 
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,"party hostel, not able to get good rest"
Wales,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location as its not a far walk from the grove or farmers market as well as a lot of shops and restaurants. i&amp;#39;d recommend spending time in the other banana bungalow as well to see the other side of hollywood. breakfast is good and the atmosphere is great as staff are friendly and welcoming. planned tours most days and activities in the evening too. offer free parking too.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"good hostel, quite a bit further away from hollywood blvd than their sister hostel at east hollywood though"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i travel a lot &amp; have stayed in many hostels, but i think this one has had the most social atmosphere of all of the ones i&amp;#39;ve been in! they arrange visits to the beach, universal, &amp; disneyland, which is awesome. and everything was clean and well organized! had a great time and met some great people in my room and in the common room downstairs! "
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,6,6,8,10,10,8,"i stayed here while traveling solo from overseas and it was my first hostel experience. i enjoyed my stay here a lot. the atmosphere was great and it was a great place to meet people as well as new drinking buddies. the staff were helpful, friendly and polite. the rooms weren't amazing but the cost was right for what you got. "
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great people, the breakfast will keep you going while you stroll around la. a good night&amp;#39;s sleep in a comfortable bed waits for you if you need it!!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"stayed here for one night during a long layover via lax. quite social place which is good if your looking to make friends, but was a tad bit annoying when you are looking for a cheap place to rack out for the night. the staff was helpful and the breakfast was decent enough."
Australia,Male,31-40,6.9,6,8,8,8,6,8,4,"much like most of hollywood these days, the hostel looked pretty tired and run down. common areas and kitchen could be a lot more cleaner than they were. some beds had no blankets, some pillows are like resting your head on a bag of potatoes. lots of activities on offer from the hostel though which was great."
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"the door is always locked so i felt really safe in banana bungalow. the neighborhood felt pretty safe as well, which i value as a female traveling alone. i was fortunate enough to be in a dorm with very easygoing, respectful people. there was an event going on downstairs when i went to sleep, but my sleep was never interrupted. the free breakfast was enough to get me started on my long journey the next day.  if you&amp;#39;re looking for a chill place to stay, i&amp;#39;d recommend banana bungalow in fairfax."
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,8,10,"really good, i&amp;#39;ll definitely stay there again "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,terrific!!  i didn&amp;#39;t participate in any of the activities but they seemed great. pool tables and tvs.  rooms cleaned every morning. and you can&amp;#39;t beat the price. 
USA,Male,25-30,8,6,10,10,4,10,10,6,"yeah, great hostel and everything, sure. but the kitchen is loaded with styrofoam cups and bowls and paper plates and plastic cutlery! at a hostel! i stayed here on my first night back to the states in two years of travel in australia and new zealand, where every hostel is super environmentally friendly and having any sort of disposable crockery and cutlery would be out of the question. i was shocked. america is a strange place, my friends."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"they serve breakfast which rules, give away free booze on their events which also rules and there are lockers in the dorms! clint was so friendly, informative and hospitable! made me feel very welcome, as well as ara, sam and riley! "
Philippines,Male,25-30,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,8,10,location was great!! staff was always happy to help you with something.

USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have stayed at banana bungalow several times. there is solo much to say but, it feels like home every time i stay there. i call it my ""vacation home"" the staff is great, always friendly and very helpful. there are plenty of activities and opportunity to socialize or just chill. it is located close to the grove which is great for people watching and farmers market. there is shopping nearby and great facilities to cook in. i recommend this hostel to everyone. see you soon banana bungalow !!!!!"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a nice stay !   
CostaRica,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,8,10,so clean! very well kept restrooms! quiet atmosphere and well supplied kitchen.
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,awesome hostel and great price. $30 w/parking per day is hard to beat. great people from all over the world.    my only suggestion to the staff would be to ensure that the $15 all-you-can-drink plus club event is managed better. my friend and i ended up having to pay a cover charge for lure nightclub when we were promised free cover. they said there were too many guys in the group and cut us off from free cover.so let them know beforehand to expect a various ratio please!
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.3,10,10,8,10,6,10,4,stayed here twice - after the first time i vowed never to stay again due to a terrible atmosphere but i had to due to needing to be in west hollywood.    fortunately things got better the second time atmosphere-wise: there was a great free barbecue on with comedy. very nice atmosphere for this. unfortuantely my room smelled like urine.
CzechRepublic,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i enjoyed staying in banana bungalow. the staff was friedly, beds comfy, breakfast tasty and the party crazy."
Argentina,Male,31-40,6.9,8,8,10,6,6,4,6,"great location, excellent price.  the hostel is close to all the important spots of the city. the neighbourhood is safe and pleasent. i went with my wife on honeymoon, we didn&amp;#39;t like the mood of the staff, they were very cold and distant. also, the mood of the overall guests was very weird. i&amp;#39;ve stayed in many hostels and there&amp;#39;s always a feeling of &amp;#34;shareness&amp;#34; and fellowship in the air that we couldn&amp;#39;t find here. if you&amp;#39;re looking for great price+location+don&amp;#39;t talk to me, t"

Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,6,8,4,8,8,we had a great time banana bungalow and met some awesome people. the comedy night was super funny and the free burgers and beers exceeded our expectations! delish :)  one of the girls on the front desk was really rude and not very helpful at all... a bit of a shame but apart from that w had a good stay.   thanks again 
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,it&amp;#39;s always a pleasure to stay here! i&amp;#39;ve stayed so many times that i&amp;#39;ve lost count. thanks again! and see you next year! :p
Spain,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,10,8,10,8,"this hostel is amazing! is a super fun hostel that provides with amazing activities and free stuff like bbq, shuttle to the beach and party. if i go back to la i&amp;#39;ll come back here for sure. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10," the hostel was very clean.  i love the fact that the parking was free.  for the location and the price, you can&amp;#39;t beat it."
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6.3,6,8,4,8,4,6,8,"good hostel but not the best location, the other bannana bungalow is located better. staff are useless, breakfast average, they advertise loads of free stuff but there not really free. workers need to find a way to promote more of a social atmosphere. very clean though"
England,Female,25-30,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,8,8,"good location, just a short bus ride to hollywood bvld, close to supermarket. free breakfast of toast and cereal, good wifi, nice communal areas, generally kept very clean."
Germany,Male,25-30,8,6,10,6,10,8,8,8,great hostel for west hollywood kind of area. staff are super nice and helpful regarding activities. during my stay there it was a very age varying crowd there...
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,good location. basic amenities. i had to kill a few cockroaches and that was the only downside.
China,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,nice hostel. i want to be there again.
Norway,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,really great place to meet people and have a good time. the people there is really chill and it&amp;#39;s easy to get to know people.

Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"kind of party hostel, but the room i stayed was noisy free. beds are comfortable, but i missed individual lights and more power sockets. everything was very clean. free breakfast is good. cheap laundry service and other great facilities. it's easy to meet people around. staff is helpful. location is nice, walking distance to farmers market e near to bus stops (easy to get to everywhere)."

Netherlands,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"i am in l.a. for two weeks and am staying in different hostels, just to experience different neighbourhoods.  this hostel has been my favourite by far.  very nice atmosphere.  people actually talk to each other.  nice garden, big kitchen, nice lounge downstairs.  and easy enough to get to by bus for non-drivers as well.  recommended."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"i'm 100% coming back the next time i'm in la! i couldn't have asked for a better place, with a nicer bunch of people. the staff were so friendly and accommodating and events we're held most nights for the patrons. you can't go wrong with burgers, tacos, comedy, karaoke etc. wish i could've stay longer!"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,7.7,8,10,8,10,8,2,8,"felt like a hospital - very sterile atmosphere. would not stay here again, but can&amp;#39;t complain about it really. for your money you&amp;#39;re getting the bare necessities which is great but no interaction with other residents (apart from some cool people in my room). one party had only ~3 people sign up so..."

Brazil,Male,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,8,8,6,6,sometimes people from staff don't have enough information about the city or even de hostel activities. people make some confusion with deliveries too.

England,Couple,25-30,4.9,2,8,6,4,6,4,4,"i have a nut allergy, the breakfast they serve was a nutty cereal and peanut butter and nutella on toast. they did have porridge but it was scared about the contamination with nuts everywhere.  it was hard to sleep, you could here cars and sirens all night, need better noise deduction windows.   the bunk beds beds were so squeaky.   if they say free drinks and dinner you are expected to tip per drink and for food. the service is great once you tip. the pub crawls they offered didn&amp;#39;t go ahead. "
Italy,Female,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,if there was a rating beyond excellent for the staff at this place i would use it. i was so impressed by the italian receptionist elena. she went above and beyond her duties to make sure i was happy and having a good time at the hostel...and i really did...thank you for making me so comfortable and for helping me with everything!

"

Italy,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,"good position, closed to farmer market and 10 min by car / 40 min walk from sunset and hollywood. many thrift shops and vintage clothing shops in the surroundings where make big deals; closed to the famous locations of school of rock highschool spot and grease gym yard spot. very good the holliwood/beverly hills/bel air/melrose tour with the van, do it if u can!"
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent place to stay. 
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was my first time at this hostel. overall was great. one thing about this hostel, you make up your own bed. they had a great kitchen and complimentary breakfast. great location as well to all tourist spot.   definitely will comeback. just wished they had a all male dormitory. girls that i was with were cool and respectful so it's all good."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,10,"the experience at banana bungalow was ok. i was there in winter, so i guess that the lack of energy was to be expected. the room was nice, the facilities clean and the location central. "
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,the day time staff (until  midnight or so) were so great. everyone was knowledge and extremely friendly. i ended up extending my stay with them and i'm glad i did. the hostel was cleaned and the overall facility was awesome. i really appreciate the time and activities at staff put together. definitely would stay there again and i can't wait to come back!  cheers from canada
Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"the one thing to point out is the location. although the hostel is located at one of the bigger streets with a bus stop just a few yards/meters ahead the bus connection to downtown la / airport / famous beaches takes a while more than with the metro. however the hostel feels very secure, is clean, had acceptable beds and launch some activities (with free food and drinks) almost every day. the breakfast is however with just tosts and cerials rather disappointing althought standard in the usa."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,"a decent hostel with good facilities and atmosphere. they organize a few good social events such as open mic on mondays. however, seems to be located a fair way from public transport but i think la is not very well set up for public transport. walking distance to sunset strip and hollywood boulevard but."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,great hostel. one of the best i've stayed in. except the cleaner comes in in the morning and dobs you in for banging all the girls!  
Chile,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,2,8,10,8,8,is a good place to pass the night but the location is kinda far from everywhere
Singapore,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,good location and fun activities.
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really appreciated the atmosphere..offering shuttle buses and bbq nights. right on!
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,6,10,low season meant not a lot of people there but events are every night so good way to meet people. good breakfast. city maps could be better. 
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i've stayed in a lot of hostels. the staff were friendly and willing to help. they provided toast and cereals for breakfast and every night had an activity to join in on. the hostel was clean and tidy. highly recommend.
Russia,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,"nothing special about this place. breakfast is 90% carbs and sugar. liked the coffee and fruits though.  rude cleaning man didn't let me sit in a common room after midnight, ridiculous!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"had an amazing time here, the events that the hostel arranged were soo good! really good kitchen and common room. only issue i had was that some of my clothes were pinched out of the storage room, and a friend had there jacket stolen from the basement. otherwise good hostel. "
England,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,6,8,10,10,8,"overall a great hostel and a lot of fun. location is a bit further out and a bit quieter than the other banana hostel but the staff here are really great organise loads of fun stuff and get everyone involved. room was clean, facilities were decent, breakfast was ok.    secure parking under the hostel was also a big bonus.    would definitely recommend."

England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"this is a really great hostel, the staff are really friendly and helpful, the location is really good. the atmosphere is really sociable and i met some great people here, was very sad to leave. there are activities every night and really good evenings involving free or very cheap alcohol and food. with a free minibus over to the other hostels for these nights you meet so many people and get the benefit of a central hollywood location. i would definitely come back, it made la for me!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i thought it was really great, esp the parking even though it gets full sometimes. location was amazing, staff were great! i cant wait to stay there again!"
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,10,8,"great place to stay. dorms have their own bathrooms, free breakfast included, they organise plenty things to do. i'd recommend the comedy and karaoke nights, they are awesome (even if you're not really into it)!"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,10,6,10,6,6,10,"this hostel has potential to be amazing and is set up well but completely misses the mark with atmosphere. gina works hard rallying up people to do things and is full of info and is super friendly, the hostel could do with more workers like her (and a bar that is open daily!)"
France,Female,18-24,8.9,6,8,8,10,10,10,10,super helpful staff and something going on every night  a bit expensive but it's the states hey  very close to the canyon for great hikings above la 
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,"great friendly atmosphere for young travelers, a different event each night and very social. shower didn't work very well and.didn't get very hot"

England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i have never reviewed a hostel before but in felt like i needed to this time. i came to america for the first time and by myself. this hostel made me feel welcome from the day i arrived and that made things alot easier for me. the staff there were brilliant and i met some great people whilst staying here. they put on some great entertainment and was located close to transport. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting for the first time or just wants somewhere fun and safe.
Mexico,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel is very nice! and it is very well located close to main streets and easy accesses. staff are friendly and willing to help any time! what i missed a little was to have more atmosphere, but maybe as i was busy i didn&amp;#39;t really get the time to talk to anyone. awesome value for money! i would definitely come back!"
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,not only did i sleep well and the customer service was first rate. but the facilities were soon good and the atmosphere was awesome. everyone was really friendly.
Canada,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,6,6,4,"kitchen was clean but bathrooms and dorm rooms were filthy. the blankets that are left in the beds are in bad condition.   hostel is in a very cool, safe area. walkable at night.   staff was friendly and helpful."
Lithuania,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,8,6,6,"i am impressed by the size of the hostel - it is huge! there is plenty of space inside, but also outside (ground floor and upstairs) - the kitchen is big too! breakfast was impressive so the activities at night - highly recommend attending those, especially free bbq and stand-up comedy! location is great too and what i also loved was the airport transfer that you can organise especially if you have no car in la... overall good, but i felt like it was harder to meet people in such a big place."
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel, bit party scene and staff constantly organising activities to get everyone involved. breakfast choice a bit limited."

Australia,Male,31-40,6,8,8,8,4,8,2,4,"completely lacking in atmosphere. seemed to be a lot of long-stay tenants - first two people i spoke to had been there 20-30 days. friendly staff, good location but won't be back."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"banana bungalow west has an atmosphere very similar to a friendly college dorm, that faculty were very kind, the building was secure, and the off street parking was a big plus. it was a great place to stay."

NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,great place to stay
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the people that work at this hostel are fantastic! i took their advice and went on a great hike. the breakfast is fantastic 8am-11am. so you have plenty of time to sleep in, have breakfast ad check out by 11am. they will let you store your stuff securely if you have already checkout and want to explore more of la before you fly out.  great location. you can walk around and discover places. highly recommend staying. only thing i can say is bake sure you get a comfy pillow on arrival. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, great people. if i ever come back to la this is my place to stay!"
Finland,Female,25-30,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,8,"i have nothing bad to say about this hostel - i wasn't in la to party, so i was happy that even though they arranged different parties and outings, the hostel itself was very calm. the staff was nice, hostel was clean, wifi worked really well and i was very happy that they had lockers in the rooms that you can use with a normal padlock. i would definitely recommend this hostel, i felt safe there and that's not always granted with hostels. i'm very happy with my stay :)"
England,Male,25-30,8.9,6,10,6,10,10,10,10,best hostel in almost 4 years travelling - lots of fun - lots of party nights - lots of free booze - lots of hot chicks - expensive but that's la - and location pretty outta the way but free shuttle most nights to the clubs
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,8,8,6,6,"i would recommend the banana bungalow. the staff were friendly and helpful. the kitchen is enormous, and the hostel feels safe. good location for walking also. i would not recommend taking the airport shuttle, however. i called up with the time i needed to be at the airport and arrived 45 minutes late despite little traffic that day.  the shuttle driver grabbed coffees, socialized at hotel stops, and even dropped his wife off to work on the way after i had told him i was going to miss my flight."
Italy,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,not so closed to hollywood boulevard so that a car or hostel shuttle is needed.  activities and clubs are awesome.
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"staff were lovely and there was something organised for every evening, a wonderful place to stay! "
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,10,8,6,bobby was incredibly helpful! he helped us sort our car parking and couldn't do enough to make our stay a good one. other members of staff were great too.

Belgium,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"banana bungalow is a very nice and social hostel. the courtyard, lounge area and cellar provide a lot of space to relax or meet up with people. there's a big kitchen, plenty of bathrooms and breakfast provided. the hostel organizes an activity every night, going from free bbq to party bus to karaoke. staff was friendly, rooms were clean. to be honest, i was sad to leave."

England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved staying at this hostel! right in the heart of west hollywood, just a stones throw away from the farmer's market and a short uber ride away from the strip. great vibes and the staff (niall!) were very kind and accommodating. a lot of hostels i've stayed in are very business orientated and were mainly concerned with giving us a bed for a couple of nights. this hostel, however, made sure that everyone felt right at home and made sure that we were all having a good time!"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,6,8,8,8,8,was a really fun hostel the staff was really cool and they had tons of cool activities for people to do. they were a bit expensive because they were a bit far from places to see. but i had a good time.

Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"very nice hostel overall. staff is friendly and james is a legend. there is a lot of activities. however, there was an error with management and there was a traveller who was sent to the wrong room, this resulted in myself being rudely awoken at 5 am by two drunk guests claiming that i was in one of their beds - as the numbers didn't add up. management took no responsibility for this and refused to compensate me for the error, which is pretty weak considering how expensive it is to stay here."
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"great hostel to stay at, lots of good events and some cool people to meet too. price is par for hollywood, hostel was lovely and clean with helpful staff and great kitchen facilities, loads of fridge space and cookers etc. breakfast was good, cereal, fruit, bread etc. can walk to places but lots of buses nearby. enjoyed stay so much that i decided to come rebook for the last few days of my usa travelling."

Canada,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,great and safe location. easy walking to local sights. favourite part is how close it is to a 24 hour diner. 
Chile,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,6,10,8,10,10,lively atmosphere and good times. the only downside of this hostel is the location. i'd reccomend the hollywood banana bungalow instead of west hollywood
France,Female,31-40,5.7,6,2,8,6,6,8,4,"i heard there are worse places, i say there are better..! it's far from clean and everything is very run down. the people are cool but the security is close to non existent.. shame, the location is great so with a bit more effort it could make a lovely place.."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,10,8,"not for all age groups, perfect atmosphere for pre party drinks before partying in l.a"
Sweden,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,i liked it!
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,"i thought the place smelled kind of weird but they did a lot of night activities and even do some free food which is pretty sweet. staff weren't overly accommodating, more into each other. lockers in the forms could be much sturdier - two guys could definitely pick it up and leave. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,8,10,"very clean and great facilities including on site laundry, big kitchen and kitchen storage, tvs, computers and lounges, outdoor areas etc so nice environment. helpful staff. basic rooms. location is good but everything in la is so spread out and public transport isn't the best so getting to/from anywhere not in walking distance is annoying (that's la though, not the hostel). lots of activities organised day and night to join if you want. good experience, would recommend. "
England,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,"the ceiling in our dorm was leaking when i arrived. the girl at reception was happy to give me another dorm though. out of the multiple staff only two were helpful and friendly, the others were dismissive. free tea and coffee all day and a decent free breakfast, plus free luggage storage and free lockers for when you check out.

Japan,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"only spent one night here due to change of plans, but the staff were very nice and accommodating. the room faced a busy street and with the windows open, it got a little loud at night, but nothing a tired traveler can't sleep through. i will stay here again if i come back to la :)"
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,"if you're a first-time visitor to los angeles, this is a great place to stay. the location is super central to all kinds of hotspots - esp. weho nightlife - and the restaurants, coffee shops and bars down fairfax (just a few blocks from the hostel) can't be beat. definitely a place for travelers who like to party and socialize with others in the hostel. if that's not your thing, totally fine. but it's a fun stay that's cozy and quiet enough to get a good night's rest."

Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"i have stayed in hostels all over the world and my expectations for hostels are always low, lol. however, this one was the most clean and organized i have ever stayed."

NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,8,10,10,8,"this place is awesome. when we stayed they put on a free bbq, beers and a comedy show!! ive been traveling the last two years and i have never experienced a great deal like this. it brought everyone together and ended being a funny boozy night meeting people. the staff are super friendly they were unbelievably helpful. thanks guys you guys rock. sorry for over indulging in the free candy at reception hahaha"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,6,10,6,8,10,great hostel cleaned daily with bathroom in all rooms. helpful staff and great facilities. would definitely stay again. 
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,6,10,10,10,"great hostel, great staff, great atmosphere. our hot water didn't work in out shower but we just used another dorms shower down the hallway! great bar outside and good they even have nutella for breakfast!"
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"good stay in good location; staff were helpful when giving directions, tours and ideas of where to eat etc.  free breakfast was great too.  dorm checks would have been good as people in our room were quite inconsiderate."
Spain,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the common areas are so big that makes difficult connect with other guests. play some background music during breakfast
Canada,Male,31-40,8,10,8,8,6,8,8,8,great place to stay. it's a huge building with lots of different common areas. was kinda quiet when i stayed there but i guess it's normal for november.
Sweden,Male,41+,7.7,8,8,6,10,6,8,8,"please be aware that there will be a $ 5 credit card surcharge. the hostel claims that the price presented on hostelworld is the cash price, but that is not beeing mentioned anywhere. the hostel has good facilities, but still has a slight school atmosphere. there will also be a credit card inprint at check in, in case you damage any property, like they do in real hotels. there are 2 bus lines outside the hostel, though you have to change to get to most places, execpt hollywood boulevard."
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,only one night but no major complaints. first come first serve parking is a hassle for holidays though.
Canada,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff was great and everyone was so nice.  loved the underground parking and the location
USA,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,staff was less than helpful and security was just rude.  no one enjoys their job and it shows
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"my stay was great. no complaints, they made everything easy. some nights i stayed out til 4-5am and there was usually someone at the door keeping watch.  wherever i just hung out at the hostel all day there was always plenty to do if nothing else shooting pool. great location, plenty of things to do or see within a 10 min walk. a few sketchy characters about at night, but nothing you haven't seen before i'm sure. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,6,8,10,i had a fun time here. the staff were helpful but depending who you got you felt like you were annoying them by asking what bus to catch... the place was very clean and very easy to settle in. i would stay here again for sure. 
Canada,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a very nice stay again, thank you to all the front desk staff, kitchen staff, maintenance and cleaning staff. i look forward to my next stay at banana."
Ireland,Female,25-30,6.3,6,8,4,6,10,6,4,not in a great location at all... near nothing! and not particularly keen either! don't confuse it with their downtown hostel.. same name and a totally different location!!
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"it is a good hostel, but not excellent. have a good staff, location and atmosphere. moreover, offers some great activities to do. the rooms are in good size. some issues bother, like you cant stay in common areas after midnight (even if u are just using the wifi) ou the breakfast, that is too bad. i always needed to find a decent breakfast in a close place."
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"this place was great. it's in west hollywood so you're close to hollywood boulevard and griffith park/observatory. the parking is quite limited but is under the property and quite secure, you just have to get in there before 5pm to guarantee a space. there's lots of places within walk distance and some good places to eat. staff are great and attentive but it is a lively hostel and can get quite noisy at night, especially if you're near the main road as traffic never stops! great for groups."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,10,6,8,8,8,8,we only stayed for two nights but this place seemed a good hostel. clean rooms. friendly and helpful staff. 10 min bus ride to the walk of fame and chinese theatre. quite expensive but all hostels in la seem to be! good kitchen. lots of organised nights and trips available but we didn't have time to participate (but probably would have done if we had stayed longer. overall a pretty good hostel! 
CzechRepublic,Male,41+,6.6,6,8,10,6,6,6,4,"i booked and paid for 2 nights and ran away after the 1st night with 50 bed bug bites, 4 bites even on my face. the girls, staying in the room before, seemed to be ok, so the bugs seemed to be brought there by a homeless guy arriving on the same day as me. the hostel has no refund policy, so i did not get my money back for the second night. otherwise, internet does not work in the rooms and they throw you out of the common rooms at midnight, so if you need internet at night, bad luck."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,8,10,8,8,10,i was told west hollywood was a little sketchy but i felt fine walking around the neighbourhood and found some great nearby bars and cafes. hostel is clean and friendly. i would recommend. 
Netherlands,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"the atmosphere in this hostel is amazing, a lot of social activities and a great crew! made a lot of new friends at this place!"
Ireland,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i only stayed one night in the hostel so it is hard to give it a proper review. however, for that one night i had no major complaints. the rooms were small and it was a bit of an obstacle course coming in in the dark with bags and suitcases everywhere. the weren't many plugs for around the beds for charging which wasnt ideal. other than that, it ticked all the boxes!"
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,10,6,10,4,8,8,4,"great location in west hollywood. this is a fun ""party hostel"" so loosen up and have a good time.   don't expect a super clean, state of the art facility.   "
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,yeah this place is good
Belgium,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,it really smells in the hostel.. but we had free parking !!
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"the staff are really nice and helpful! while the colour of our room was not the best (bright green wall and curtains are not fun) but was a good size for everyone to fit. the mini fridge, microwave and tv were a nice surprise. a lot of lovely little touches that made the stay really enjoyable. loved the events that the hostel puts on every night, we went on the friday one and it was so much fun! would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking for fun and new friends."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,"not very comfy atmosphere, at the reception the staff was not amazingly friendly. can't stay in the main area after midnight and no wifi in the room. the beds were not amazing too. shaky."
Canada,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,it was my first time staying at a hostel and everything went smooth! the staff was great and i loved how clean it was! i will stay there again!
Denmark,Female,41+,7.1,6,6,8,6,10,8,6,"the staff was excellent, and i liked the atmosphere, but a room for 6 people whitout a window to open, was not good for me. it was to hot and there were to much noice from the traffic."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place, great atmosphere and plenty of big nights out!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,6,10,6,8,10,"positives: great hostel, good social activities, good place to meet people for a lone traveller, very clean,  good breakfeast toast jam, cereal, ect ect, good wifi, not too big not too small,     negatives: just a little bit of a walk to get to most places, not really close to any supermarkets ect"

Norway,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,"definitely one of the cleanest i have stayed on. the staff was great and very helpful. in door parking was a plus, and the breakfast was better than other hostels."
Taiwan,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,too noisy

USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"pros  free parking  free breakfast included cereal (non-diary options available), bread, nutella, pb&amp;j, and oatmeal  lockers in the rooms were awesome (bring your own lock!)  closet area in the room  small shelves for top bunk (big enough to put your phone and keys)    cons  if you couldn't find parking in the small garage, parking was a pain to find on the street  i slept in a room by a window that faced the street and the street noise was very loud.  beds are wobbly."
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, with young people, very dinamic, the staff is always very friendly and willing to help.  the dorms are cleaned daily, free breakfast, great computers available, always have events at night.  love it, i would definitely go back again."

Philippines,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,"this hostel is very very relax. too relax that you can do mostly anything. a lot of areas that you can hangout by yourself, a group or a party. internet dies from time to time but when it is up it has a fast connectivity. street noise can be heard in your room. every night there is always something going on inside or outside the hostel. this place is great for the young hearts."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,awesome place.. really good atmosphere
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,8,10,8,8,8,"great hostel with good facilities, big kitchen lots of computers.a wall with the events on every night which is great and tours they offer. would recommend! "

SouthKorea,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,6,6,10,10,8,the atmosphere was good and the staffs were really nice and helpful. the upper bed was a llttle trembly when climbing and locker seems to be useless.

Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,they truly deserve a 100% ranking. had 3 brand new macs in the lobby with free internet. all worked really fast. they had clearly thought of all the little details that any traveller would want in a hostel. had a few problems with the shower and was fixed strait away. staff were helpful and friendly. they had small safes in the bedrooms for valuables and if your padlock wouldn't fit thy had a vending machine in the common area that sold locks for 2.50$ . best hostel i have stayed in. 
England,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,i only stayed here for one night in the end 
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,8,6,10,10,"some of the staff were a bit rude, not all of them though. rooms a decent size with comfy mattresses. lots of activities put on by hostel. location was a little bit out of the way of everything but a nice 2.6km walk up to hollywood boulevard. i recommend it! "
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,"we were recommended by a friend to stay here and we were extremely pleased with our experience. we upgraded to a private room and it was great - bed was comfy, fridge, tv, small balcony and a clean bathroom. there were parties on every night/something to do - we already had stuff planned and booked so we didn't join in but we wish we did! the staff were fantastic - helped us with anything we needed!     really pleased."
Russia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,nice hostel. i recommended. 
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"i had a great time staying at the banana bungalow. i liked the layout of the hostel, it was very spacious and conducive to partying :). the staff was friendly, the rooms were nice, the free breakfast was good. i would stay here again."
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"definitely recommend, staff helpful, large facility's... free computers and fast wifi..all in all everything you'd want and need from a hostel"
Germany,Female,18-24,6.3,4,8,8,6,6,6,6,"the hostel itself was okay, location was pretty good.the rooms were small but they seemed to be in a good shape. breakfast was average, the facilities seemed to be nice but you had to pay for the pool table, the computers hardly worked and there was no wifi in the rooms, laundry could only be done after 5pm. the stuff was helpful but they wanted you to spent money at there activities which were totally overpriced.  all in all a okay stay, but a little overpriced."
England,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,6,10,8,"stayed from halloween to thanksgiving, brilliant place on fairfax right near local shops and about 15 minute walk to the stars. transportation not too reliable near by however the weather is decent u dont mind. the hostel itself is great for its money with free breakfasts, constant activities and normally drinks and dinner for 10$ on most nights. i had amazing time here and already willing to come back next time im in l.a."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"great hostel, was really happy that it had it's own undergroud carpark!"
Switzerland,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"viktoria is very helpful.  she personally grabbed extra pillows etc for me.  95% of the guests are under 22, but i knew that  before i signed up.  loved the 5 computers they have.  the kitchen has refrigerators which is great.  the room was warm, but they turned up the ac for me.  the only thing i would change is a non street room because i'm not used to traffic noise.  outstanding for 27 dollars."
Colombia,Couple,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,6,10,8,2,"cleanliness is very poor, we had bed bugs in our beds and  we were victims of them"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,love the 24 hour free coffee in the garden!
Denmark,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,third or fourth time staying here. great hostel regarding location and money value. go here to meet and hang out with a lot of different people from all over the world.
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,4,8,8,6,"the showers here are bad. in comparison to all of the hostels i have stayed at, this hostel is less than average, the only thing i liked about this place was the people i met. hollywood is a total dive though so it depends what you're after. one good thing i could say is the hang out area in the basement is a great idea."
USA,Male,18-24,5.7,4,2,6,6,4,10,8,cellphone and charger were stolen from my room half hour before i woke up.  don't take peoples good nature for granted.  even if it is your room.
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.7,8,10,8,8,6,6,8,no wifi in the rooms. breakfast is good.
England,MixedGroup,25-30,6,6,6,8,4,6,6,6,"i was not overwelmed by banana bungalow. it is quite loud with all the traffic passing and gets very hot in the rooms, with 6 people. i would advise not taking any valuables as there are only a few very small lockers to secure them in. i would give it a 5/10, and i probably wouldn't book in there again. the price was reasonable, but you definitely get what you pay for. we checked out a day early."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly and the basement after hours is party town! could do with more power points in the rooms though 
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,excellent everything
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,6,10,"stayed here for 6 night, enjoyed the hostel, comfy clean and relaxed, but the atmosphere was fairly dull, not much going on during the week."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"really good hostel with a nice bar area and good facilities such as a table tennis table.  also regular nights combined with their sister hostel, with limo transportation between the hostels."

England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,10,8,great hostel! everyone is super friendly and welcoming. as a female travelling alone i felt safe in this hostel and in the area
England,Female,18-24,6.9,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,"bit out of the way of anything and a fair walk to hollywood but there are bus stops near by. sheets has seen better days, but generally the place was clean, the wifi was good and the free breakfast was good! small lockers so was unable to put bag into them. free shuttles to lax only go at 12:00 daily."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"great staff and facilities, safe location, awesome events organised, great place."
England,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,10,6,"good overall. looks a bit tired and drab in places but it was clean enough. a bit out of the way too but wasn't too dificult to find some transport into the bits of l.a you will want to go to (i suggest buying a tap card). a large, young crowd which made it very good socially."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"travelled throughout america and this was the best hostel we stayed at.  the staff were really friendly and it didn't see like too much effort for them when helping us.  they arrange tours to universal studios including shuttle as well as many others.  rooms were cleaned every day and felt safe.  general atmosphere was brilliant, they offered nights out but werent too pushy.  big lounge and basement to socialise in.  overall, great hostel!!!"
France,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"awesome weekend in la and this hostel, i'll come back. staff very nice, good parties, lot of fun !!"

Austria,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6,6,8,8,4,8,4,4,"there were no lights or plugs available for each bed but we had to share 2 plugs (6 people). there was a funny smell in our room, the window cannot be described as a window, since it was frosted glass. i stayed in many other hostels which were much cleaner!!! the sheets had a lot of holes and beds felt like there's an earthquake when the other one on the bunk was moving slightly.  staff friendly"
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,a great hostel for meeting fellow travellers! if you are looking for a base to explore hollywood/beverly hills area it's great! the tours are excellent and the staff were so friendly! the night time activities were such good value for money! would have stayed longer if we could!

NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"awesome place to stay if you have a few days in la and want somewhere to stay and leave on your adventures there. has a cool shopping mall close by and staff were really friendly! if you are wanting to be in the heart of hollywood or la then this isnt the place but we had 3 days here and we arranged all our tours, transport, trips to themeparks here and it was great not having to worry about doing it ourselves.   clean rooms big communal spaces! great value for money"
Finland,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,6,10,8,8,amazing staff. super friendly and always keen to help. only thing what i miss was air conditioner in my room. good kitchen and nice set up on the backyard.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,"safe location, bus ride away from the strip. friendly staff who make sure your having a good time, plenty of activities. i am under 21 and had a great time meeting plenty of other young travelers. "

Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was great. cannot think of anything bad. la is bad for public transport though. takes ages to go anywhere.
Belgium,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,it's a very nice hostel to stay in and they have a lot of things you can do there like tours around hollywood or a trip to universal studios and even trips to good clubs in hollywood. the only thing that bothered me was the cleanliness of the rooms and the kitchen.
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,6,10,10,"great locations to central hollywood and beverly hills. hostel try's to promote tours alot which cost too much for budget travelers, because of this they offer little help on other options. room tidy and clean, wifi excellent, evening entertainment fantastic, public transport on doorstep, use metro planner to organize route. beds comfy, staff and guests friendly "
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,10,6,8,8,"good hostel. massive room for drinking down staris when the clubs shut so noise and disturbance isnt and issue for people who don't want to party, but those who do can do so all night withough annoying others."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,me and a friend stayed here for 6 nights in 2013 and enjoyed our stay. there was plenty happening for those who wanted to take tours and location was great. bus could easily be taken to santa monica or hollywood blvd etc. it was fairly easy to meet other people and we ended up going out with them.
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i absolutely loved banana bungalow! they had events every night, free bbq's from time to time and the staff are great. the place also allows travelers to socialize and interact easily! highly recommended!"

NewZealand,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"nice tidy building with great smoking areas. had a dorm with an ensuite which was brilliant, however the shower pressure and temperature was super annoying as it chopped and changed all the time. other than that, a really nice hostel. "
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,"evening entertainment and freebies were good. self service breakfast would be nicer, rather than having your cereals rationed."
Brazil,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,8,8,10,10,"the staff people were helpful and there are lots of activities at the nights, but the location is not so good and it would be nice if they have some free shuttle to the beach."
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great place, would definitely stay there again next time i'm in la."
Australia,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"love this place it's got social events with sister hostel, free food and drink. i enjoyed my stay but if your a light sleeper pick a room away from road, traffic runs all night (no exaggeration 10pm-7am) and is loud. that aside love this place."
France,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,"good hostel with lots of day tour organised (universal studio, disney , hollywood). receptionnists are very nice &amp; helpful. was in room 203, 6 dorm ensuite. very clean! got reimbursed for the shuttle bus. if you have no car like me, you have to walk to have food and stuff but all buses  next door (217 &amp; 780) goes to hollywood boulevard where you can grab a metro to go anywhete you want (universal, long beach etc....... day pass is 5$, did not use the kitchen.cheesecake factory next door.must do!"
Hungary,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay, very friendly staff. good location.  nice place to hang around, or relax.   you can always ask questions they are happy to help.  huge lobby,and party room downstairs."
France,Male,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,8,10,6,"a very good atmosphere with very kind people.. one problem only : a lack of communication on the events which are on schedule and which are great fun : barbecues, beer pongs..."
Canada,Female,25-30,5.7,4,6,6,8,6,4,6,"one the female staff member was really rude. she walked into my room looking for some girl and slammed the door behind her both times. the 6 bed is not really just 6 but 12.  4 of the girls in my leave the hostel before 7am for shoplifting and work, but breakfast doesn't start until 08am. overall, i wouldn't go back or recommend it. there are some amazing hostel not too far away though "
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,close by and free parking!!
Italy,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"i was a solo traveller and stayed there just for 2 nights in a 6 beds dorm, but everything was really good, room cleaned everyday and the staff organize social events during the week. if i go back to la i'll definitely come back to banana bungalow!!"
Germany,Female,25-30,3.7,4,6,4,2,6,2,2,"guy, who worked at the breakfast area was burping all the time. toilets were disgusting, dirty comforters, which probably never got cleaned yet. party athmosphere (if you have a room downstairs, it can happen to you that the dj is right outside infront of your window). "
Germany,Male,25-30,6,4,6,10,4,4,8,6,the cleaner stole stuff from my bed when i was out of the room for just 1 min.   (we didn't  call the cops / compliant)
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,6,8,8,8,10,"very nice hostel. clean bedrooms, very secure. the only drawback is the location, a bit far from the nightlife, as transportation in la, especially at night, is terrible."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,10,8,best hostel you will find in la city. good value for backpacker trip
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"loved this place, met some lovely people, free food for breakfast and most dinners, great tours, good prices nice beds!  free wifi!!"
Sweden,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my favorite place in los angeles!

Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"awesome, no more to say. thanks for the stay!!"
Germany,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,6,8,8,"i loved the buffet in the evening, the breakfast could have been better, more variety, maybe some ham or cheese and a muffin or a croissant...."
Australia,Male,41+,7.1,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,clean and has nice charm.  but takes a bus ride to get to the major attractions.
HongKong,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,4,8,8,8,8,"dont even think to walk to the metro station, probably will require 45mins-an hour good walk.  fisherman market, universal studio are attractions near by.   all others require a cab to get there.  the upside is, they sometimes offer value dinner or clubs entrance.   if you come to hollywood just for clubbing or parties, this one is the one for you."
NorthernIreland,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great hostel with a perfect location. all staff were really helpful.
England,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,"this is a nice hostel in a relatively good location. the staff are really friendly, however; the hostel did lack a bit of character and you really need a car to successfully get around."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is simply amazing! party everyday, people from all over the world, plus at a great location."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,6,10,10,8,8,"very good hostel. staffs were really friendly and kind, and facilities were good. also, there are many tours which are hosted by the hostel. i strongly recommend to take city tour. the host named michael is really friendly and nice person. i really had a nice time during the city tour. however, location is not that good. even though it is very close to the bus stop, it seems not that safe to walk around hostel after 9 p.m. nonetheless, very good hostel, overall. i recommend this hostel!"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  the environment was great for meeting people, and secure enough to still have privacy.  onsite parking which was a definite plus.  they have computers in the lounge for use, including printing abilities!"
Italy,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,8,10,10,one of the best hostel in california that i've ever been!!!!
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,for a young  man about to be 60 it was great ! !
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,6,6,8,2,6,"the staff was friendly and they had good offers for going out.   the hostel itself was very noisy and loud and the common roum reminded me of the 80's.   the dorm was ok,but too small and the girls from the other room had to use our door that it was a 12 bed dorm in fact.  the linen wasn't clean,we found some hair and dirt on it.   location wasn't too bad even though you have to walk about 20-30 minutes to the hollywood boulevard but at least it seemed like a safe neighbourhood."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,10,6,10,8,"such a good place to meet people, hostel has events going on during the week.. rooms are a bit cramped but are in decent condition and the staff is friendly. definitely recommend!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,6,10,8,10,10,"this was my first stop in my trip, and it was my first trip overseas ever. the staff were very nice, they gave directions and were always ready to help.  kitchen is big, heaps of fridges and the free dinners are good. (not anything amazing, but free food is good food).  the rooms are cleaned daily and the people in this hostel were magnificent. i actually didnt like la so my best times there were in the hostel. location isn't that great so rent a car if you can.  would stay again."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,"pretty good experience for my first time in a hostel. unfortunately first night there was no towels available for me until next morning. but room was clean, had a locker for personal stuff. staff were very helpful on my departure on helping me track down my booked shuttle to the airport."
Germany,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"good place to meet other travelers. they have events planned every night, like free bbq or free drinks with party at the hostel or sister hostel and a comedy show every week which was lot if fun! good and big kitchen with everything you need. staff is friendly and helpful. would definitely stay there again."
Belgium,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,"good hostel, just take in consideration that public transport finish early (between 7and 8 pm)  and they charge you an extra $5 for visa/mastercard"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic again
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,6,10,8,"it was easy to meet other travellers, the decor was really nice, it was clean and in a safe neighbourhood, close to shopping on melrose, the activities were good too. i didn't like that the female dorm had only one door for two rooms, so instead of 5 other people waking up early and making noise, there was 6 more from the other room always walking through. also, luckily i noticed beforehand that the curtains were see-thru but others may not know and change there. good hostel otherwise tho."
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i just stayed one night. free dinner and free beers were nice. was happy about the free parking too. the mattress wasn't that comfortable. but other than that, nothing to complain about."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"excellent hostel! free beer and free food in the evening. and always something to do/planned by the hostel. friendly and helpful staff. really good location, very cool and close to all the good sights! would stay again for sure"
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel! for the most part, the staff is very helpful and nice! i've met some great new friends from this experience so i'm grateful for that! peter was amazing and very nice to get to know! he went above and beyond to help the guests! i wish i remembered the other names of the staff but the lady who served breakfast was lovely, so was the canandian dude and the blonde chick up front! darker haired chick wasn't friendly whatsoever and steve was scary when he got drunk!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,10,4,8,6,"had a good socialising area downstairs, but staff weren't that helpful. rooms were good (tv and fridge etc)."
HongKong,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,10,10,10,8,"great facilities, though cannot use wifi in the room. the common area is awesome, with pool table and tennis table."
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,"nice staff, good to have wifi on the rooms!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,good hostel. good activities. location was pretty good. and its easy to interact with others. however common area is closed down at 12 and so you have to go to your rooms then.
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the hostel has good facilities, a lot of activities, a parking lot and it's clean overall (though there were used napkins left at my bed shelf by the last person who stayed). even though the hostel is in a good area, it's located on a busy street so there is a lot of traffic noise all night long. it's a party hostel, but it didn't bother me. i didn't want to party, i just wanted a place to sleep and i was fine, but i was lucky to be in a room with quiet people."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really great staff, location, rooms and atmosphere. would definitely go back"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such a good hostel to stay in. good location, helpful and friendly staff and great atmosphere. banana bungalow was really good at organising tours for both sightseeing and nighttime partying. if you're looking for a hostel that has a great party atmosphere then stay at banana bungalow. they also organised basketball tickets for us when we stayed there.  if i ever went back to la i would stay at banana bungalow, for sure. highly recommended!"
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is a well run fun hostel which smartly caters to the needs of visitors to la it's in a safe and interesting part of town and is handy to public transport of you don't have a car. it's cheap to stay there but they don't skimp on the cleaning or security which is what counts anyway. it's on a cool street with a few bars, galleries and one of the coolest cinemas in la. they organize a lot of events many of which are free which helps if your on a budget. the club tours are great."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"great staff, good facilities, awesome comedy night and good location in west hollywood. would stay here again if i was in the area"
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,10,8,"the hostel is in a great location, close to hollywood blvd, paramount pictures and quite a few comedy clubs. it is also well linked to the bus network and it only takes around an hour to get out to santa monica if you want to hit up the beach! the hostel itself is very clean and modern, the room (i stayed in a 6 bed dorm) was a little small but the ensuite made up for that. there are lots of cool activities planned like party nights out and stand up comedians coming in to perform. great place!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,8,8,"this hostel was great. cool rooms, lots to do every day/night, easy enough to get to hollywood boulevard or santa monica. good times."
Ireland,Female,31-40,6.9,6,8,10,6,6,6,6,"excellent location, the staff were pretty helpful. i was a bit disappointed that the universal studios trip was cancelled as no one else wanted to go (and was only informed the morning of the trip).  i had some good people in my room, otherwise it would have been hard to eet people at the hostel, although they do run activities to try and encourage socialising, i found some of the people not too friendly, especially if they had been there longterm."
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,10,6,6,10,10,8,"good hotel, but the shower was not working well... good location if you have a car."
China,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,"i think the most reason to reserve a bed here is his parking a car for free and low price in la! if u would like to save  money and not be much aware of a little dirty in bed , it will be a wothy option among the  hostels."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very clean and beautiful hostel, the staff are really friendly i have lots of fun!"
HongKong,Male,25-30,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel, very well for them to keep on organizing events for the week.    also great atmosphere with the patio.  easy to meet people this way.  although get a bit noisier by night. but i guess you can't have it both way.    good wifi and everything."
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"i was surprised to discover that california residents are technically not allowed to stay here without proof of travel (bus ticket, plane ticket, etc.). it's disappointing, as i'm a ca resident and would really like to stay here on a monthly or bi-monthly basis."
Poland,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,"great hostel with nice and helpful staff.  they offer lot of attractions, like a beer pong tournament, free comedy stand up, free bbq and beer night. and many others. definitely will stay there again :"
Japan,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,10,8,a lots of fun
Taiwan,Female,25-30,4.3,4,6,4,4,6,4,2,"the bunk bed was unstable and almost made us fall down from the upper bed, every move in the bed made the bed rattle, the sound was really annoying.  the sheet of the bed was really outdated and faded  and was wet when we make the bed. even though the weather is kind of warm in l.a, the hostel only provide one piece of thin sheet as a blanket for us. we stayed in a room which just faced the road, many cars passed by all night long, so we cannot sleep well at night."
Poland,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,4,6,8,6,8,6,6,"it is in a good location. it had a free parking. if you are staying in a dorm, it all depends with who you are staying. we could not sleep, because of the loud steet noise and people who were comming back from the party."
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,"love both the banana bungalows in hollywood! great atmosphere &amp; the party limo was so cheap with free drinks etc, well worth it. very welcoming to tourists, lovely staff. clean, no problems, massive kitchen with everything you need, free food on some days. the location isn't ideal as it is in west hollywood but to get to all the bars and clubs it's a 10 dollar taxi ride away or a bus, you can't walk. but good supermarkets &amp; the grove shopping really nearby. i loved it here! would come back!"
Ireland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,"location good, but other banana bungalow better, really clean, good atmosphere and free parking...can't complain!"
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,6,6,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay, really good atmosphere and full of interesting people! only bad comment would have to be the breakfast where it wasn't help yourself and you only get 1 bowl of cereal and 2 slices of bread but other than that i would definitely recommend this hostel :) the rooms were really clean, so were the bathrooms and the beds were comfortable too. the area is great as it is close to the grove and i felt safe walking out onto the streets around the hostel. would come back :)"
England,Female,25-30,8.6,10,6,8,10,10,10,6,"really enjoyable stay, lot's of fun activities if you want them, no pressure if you don't. free food and free beer a big bonus, friendly and helpful staff. i met lots of really nice other travellers here, there is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere and lots of additional extras (like free printing) that makes the stay even easier. also nice outdoor areas with wifi."
England,Male,31-40,8,6,8,6,10,10,8,8,"a friendly and well run hostel. large place but still good for meeting fellow travellers. good balance between party/quiet atmosphere.  location ok- safe and in walking distance to some tourist attractions. the neighbourhood itself has good bars/ restaurants nearby. staff very friendly/helpful save for the one who appears to make hitting on women his sole priority.     place was kept clean, room was fine, although i understand that the ones on the ground floor are a little noisy.  would come back."
Germany,Male,,8.6,8,8,6,10,8,10,10,liked the free bbq and the comedy show. also had a fun time in the party limo bus. hostel itself is recommendable.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,8,8,"great place, friendly staff and patrons. lots of great opportunities for a solo traveler to meet people and make friends. breakfast provided in the morning is good if you like cereal and toast. i had a great stay here and would definitely stay again."
USA,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,it was. good experience.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, good place to meet others and party and not too far from everything considering ow spread out la is, always has food and drink deals going! good times!"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"it was a great stay, the social aspects of this hostel in particular were definitely a bonus!"
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,8,8,everything was great. friendly staff. felt safe at the hostel too. they even sold locks for $2 for the in room lockers. great outdoor sitting area
SaudiArabia,Male,25-30,6.9,8,10,6,6,8,4,6,"not all rooms have luggage lookers, just the small personal items ones"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,love the wifi. would be even better if it was in the room. good attempts at social events. greaet meals.
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"i've stayed here three times now, and would definitely stay again. really great location near to melrose, the grove shopping mall and farmers market, two wholefoods supermarkets, the beverley centre, and there is a cool flea market on sundays.  really social, but also chilled if that's what you prefer. hostel food could be better, and the dorm rooms can get pretty hot, but apart from that it was great and would def recommend to all travelling to or through l.a!"
England,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,10,4,"nice staff, standard rooms, great socialising!"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had the best time there such a friendly atmosphere made plenty friends they have the funniest tour guide
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,"really enjoyed our stay, loved the limo ride. only downside is if you are a beach goer its takes a long time to get to the beach by bus. would stay here again though"
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,"didn't particularly enjoy my stay, however that was probably because of my room. we had a member of staff constantly using our bathroom, coming into the room turning the light on at 3am, leaving the door open, shouting on her cell phone. the room was cluttered with her things so i had no room to put my things away and she left her dirty underwear next to my bed twice. worst part was she wasn't even staying in our room. was generally clean and good location however i wouldn't return."
Canada,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,"good place to stay if you're young and want to party in la with other travelers.  staff is helpful, location is good, cleanliness and facilities are average.  not recommended if you're a family or want a quiet time in the city."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"lots of fun. thanks for having live music, and comedians. lots of cute women too."
USA,Female,31-40,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,8,"very noisy at night due to the traffic on the road. also, no a/c was available in my room so we had to leave the windows open and couldn't get much sleep. the nice thing was having our own bathroom in the room. clean bathrooms, common areas, and rooms. there are several bus stops within walking distance of the hostel."
Brazil,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,6,6,8,6,"not really good, just ok.... lots of awesome people.... but my sheets weren't really clean, the furniture in the common areas should have been replaced already... the bathroom a little bit dirty... overall, i think it's a place that should get a little better care. it's hard to find nice hostels in us comparing to those in europe for the same price..."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,very cool hostel with clean rooms and beds and a great feel to it. i didnt have any problems and found it easy to meet other people staying there and have a good time. i am only 20 and was unsure about whether everyone would go out all the time but the hostle puts on good events and a lot of the time most people just stay there. free wifi and cheap beers i recommend it
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,great hostel in west hollywood. lots of tours which is helpful tho they are a bit pricey. cheap dinner.
Germany,Female,31-40,7.7,10,8,8,6,6,8,8,we were just for one night there. because we had to stand up early it was very noisy until the middle of the night.  but if you are over in l.a. to make party and getting to know people from all over the world it's the perfect place!  thanks!
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,staff were friendly and helpful all the time!!
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,10,8,"too big, which makes it less easy to talk to people &amp; make friends, but great communal areas and imacs free to use."
England,Female,18-24,8,6,8,6,10,10,10,6,"it was great - i had planned to stay here for one week and move on to another location in la for the second week. i went to the other hostel and straight back to banana. great atmosphere and great people. i wasn't the only one who planned to move on somewhere else and returned, either. a great vibe. if you want a party atmosphere though, go to their sister hostel 'the vibe' in hollywood."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"amazing hostel with the friendliest staff who really get to know you and befriend you (a couple of exceptions..). so much planned for everyone it's easy to meet people instantly which is a massive bonus. while some people feel hollywood is a bit of a letdown, i thought it was the perfect location. it felt safe and was near enough to hollywood to walk, but far enough away that the transport to the beaches and up to n hollywood was easy and pretty much right on the doorstep. amazing time there!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,8,8,6,8,4,8,4,"the staff were a bit clueless. our rom ended up with 10 people in it at one stage with only room for six. no idea who had left, or switched rooms.    they may blame it on the customers, but it isn't that hard to manage a few dorms."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,10,6,10,8,"good, fun hostel! the staff members were really fun, they went right out of their way to help us out! there was only one staff member who would literally stand over your shoulder whilst you were cooking.. but that's ok, she cant help it!!  all in all, highly reccommend!!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,"i had such an amazing time staying at banana bungalow! everyone was really nice and there was such a great atmosphere. each night there is something great to do, we arrived on a saturday and that night had a $5 meal at the tiki bar downstairs (massive portion sizes) then we went to one of the best nightclubs i have ever been to! was such a good night out.   the hostel is about a 30-40 minute walk to sunset blvd and hollywood blvd which is nice a sunny day otherwise a short taxi ride!"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,8,10,6,8,2,6,8,staff rude and not helpful at all not ideal if your a solo traveller everyone sticks in there own little groups. so hard to meet people. they have free meals and drink only good thing about this hostel.. don't stay here
Denmark,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,6,10,6,8,8,"this hostel is very nice if you travel alone and want to find some friends. this hostel have many cool events like free bbq night, comedy night and parties. the area with the bar is really nice and excotic. the breakfast is nothing special but it is alright, the rooms have enough space for you and your luggage, and then you share the bathroom with the people in your room. i would say though that i never would go out alone at night in the neighbour hood. the staff is energitic and helpful."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,4,8,8,6,8,6,6,"i was only here for a short stay, and it was a bit crammed with people, but it's well located and has plenty of opportunity for socialising!"
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel has a excellent location easy to get to the grove, sunset and hollywood.  offers $5 dinner and on occasion free food and beer. i ended up staying here for a month and i am returning in august and cant wait :)"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,6,10,10,10,10,"had an amazing time! much better than the 4 star expensive hotels we stayed in, would definitely recommend to anyone! staff are super friendly and we had a great time :)"
England,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,10,8,8,8,"initial impression not good, due to one member of staff who was very unhelpful, didn't give us codes for outer doors and was rude. however rest of the staff were really good, friendly and helpful. the hostel itself was really nice, in a good location- very close to bus services. good common areas and evening activities.  en-suites in rooms was a nice change. down sides were the beds were rather old and rickety. our room connected to next door= walking through ours. favourite hostel to date!"
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,6,8,4,6,2,8,6,good bathrooms. kitchen awefully big but very difficult to work ovens. staff always busy n not able to talk to u or help. they have tours the towns tour is good but really u only c gates n fences of stars homes so wouldnt recommend. the have shuttles to disney land for 50 bux b warned u can get the bus for 6 byx return its really easy just look up metro bus service.
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"one of the better hostels i've ever stayed at, thanks"
China,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,great overall. just a little bit noisy at night if you wanna fall asleep early.
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"hostel is located in west hollywood, making that a good convenient location to different areas of los angeles.  it is in walking distance of shopping and some attractions, including cbs studios.  the public transportation for the area was decent as well, for what los angeles public transportation is.  they have all sorts of information available at the hostel. shuttle vans run to major attractions. only con for me would be the noise in the lounge area &amp; it being the only place to use the wi-fi."
SouthAfrica,Female,41+,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,10,8,2nd time i've stayed there - i'll be back.    value for money - great location - free booze &amp; burger nights...what's not to like!
England,Male,18-24,8.9,6,6,10,10,10,10,10,"i love this hostel. stayed here about 10 times. friendly staff, great partys, always something organised any day of the week so real easy to meet people. they used to do a hot breakfast for $3 which i was gutted to find out they have stopped doing. i would and will be staying here again :-d"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,"1) misleading 'free shuttle', only one shuttle going to the airport. you have to book your own prime time shuttle for around $15+tip  2) some staff were excellent. the guy at the information desk is amazing, very friendly. others seemed jaded and tired and wouldn't give you the time of the day.  3) a bit of a mess inside rooms. toilet and sink was clogged up when i was there. the posters seemed to suggest this was a chronic problem.  4) great location though, walking distance to things"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,6,10,"fantastic hostel, very clean (pretty strong smell of disinfectant though) really friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast, wonderful new facilities, lots of room to chill, out door area and nice couches. i was only there for one night and didn't go out but it was a great hostel to stay at :)"
NewZealand,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"banana bungalow is fantastic!  they really offer so much for the traveler by way of information, planned evening options, breakfast is included, and you can by dinner for $5. perfect!  really well located in west hollywood and close to sunset, hollywood and melrose.  day trips available for a good rate, i recommend it if you only have a few days in la.  the rooms are clean, the bathrooms are very clean and stocked up, awesome party and chill out/lounge areas.  beds are comfortable too!"
England,Male,41+,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"great place with a very relaxed atmosphere. good tour selection, free drinks and food on activity nights, free internet, clean rooms and bathrooms, good kitchen....what more can you ask?? stay here."

Canada,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"this place has fast internet, great breakfasts, delicious dinners for reasonable prices, and plenty of fun activities to help you enjoy the hollywood experience.  i had such a nice time i extended my stay...twice!  i would especially like to thank the manager and assistant manager who handled a clerical error with style and grace.  this is the place to stay in l.a."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"really nice hostel, staff are really friendly and make an effort to get to know people. it gets cleaned like 3 times a day. they have mac computers to use for free plus free wifi. a range of free breakfast foods. great facilities. heaps of fun everyday, great atmosphere, good rooms. defo recommend!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,"good location if you having shopping in mind, close to melrose ave, the grove, the  beverly centre and robertson bvd, quite clean, breakfast good."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,6,6,"a very laid back kind of hostel with some interesting activities and a nice bar area. my bed was extremely uncomfortable and my pillow was useless, new mattresses would be a great idea. staff were all nice and interesting and there was generally a pretty friendly vibe. overall probably the best you can get in la for the money which says more about la than anything else."
England,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel! friendly staff. good atmosphere. location good, for the price. highly recommend"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,overall great hostel. had a few planned events on each night to get people socializing which was good. awesome lounge and outdoor area. love the $5 dinners they do most nights and the free breakfast each morning. good location with a bus stop just down the street.

Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel in the middle of west hollywood, one of the best areas to get you started in l.a. the tiki ""bar"" is a great place to hang out and meet fellow travellers. $5 dinners are amazing!  the staff were excellent too. they went out of their way to welcome customers around the lounges and ask about our plans and make recommendations without being pushing and gave great advice on how to do things independently. bathrooms and beds were as expected for a hostel and the free breakfast was good too"
France,Couple,25-30,7.4,10,8,8,6,8,6,6,"good hostel overall, very good price. it's more of a party place than somewhere to get some rest after a long day of visits (late night noise). some weird people in there as well..."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"awesome place, great location, have something on every night whether its a club night or $5 dinners which are amazing becasue they taste like a home cooked meal and theres no better feeling after 2 months of travelling. the rooms are very clean not a lot of space for baggage if your the last in the room but other than that awesome place to stay and they have a really great set up would definitely stay there again."
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"we travelled as a couple and stayed in the 6 person dorm. this was one of the best hostels i have ever stayed in! it had an amazing environment and feel, all the staff and people were extremely helpful and positive, giving us advice and assistance if we needed it!    i highly recommend this hostel to those travelling to la and would like to experience a true, authentic hostel experience."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"a clean, well catered hostel with a fun and friendly atmosphere. the nightly activities were great and the rooms were secure and comfortable."

Bulgaria,Female,18-24,9.3,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,"the place is really good, clean, fun and the staff is so friendly and nice! the location is also good. this is probably the best hostel i've stayed in the usa.i enjoyed my stay in banana and if i come back to la, that's the place i would like to stay."
USA,Male,41+,8,0,6,8,0,10,10,6,really enjoyed the atmosphere and the attitude of the staff.  security: no locks available for rent or sale for the lockers (i had forgot mine)  cleanliness: sheets had stains (but were clean)  privacy: for some reason curtains opening on courtyard are see-through  cost: online bookings are more expensive; i paid $35 compared to $25 for a walk-in (per nite)  overall a very positive experience
England,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"+ the staff were really good, there were always events going on everyday, whether it was beer pong in the tiki bar or free meals! offers lots of tours that you can sign up for &amp; free airport pick up from lax. you can book onto a shuttle back to the ai"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,i really loved this hostel - i stayed an extra 2 nights. i would definitely recommend it to another person :)
Scotland,Female,18-24,8.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,10,"we had a private room and has been the nicest room we have had in almost 2 months in the states. we had three beds (there were only 2 of us), a little balcony, a tv and a private bathroom. it got a bit noisy on friday night, but everything stopped at 11pm."
CzechRepublic,Female,18-24,6.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,2,this hotel is not clean and as they arrange many night activities ... it gets very very noisy during the night if your room is in the lowerest level.
Italy,Male,25-30,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,6,"i think this is one of the best places to stay in la, especially if you're a young person looking 4 fun. la is quite a mess for tourists, and the hostel provides a good and affordable night lige program. i personally was not here for fun, but for a university meeting, so had few time to party; but the hostel was full with really diverse people, with high chances of social life. and, amazingly, the rooms were not noisy at all. if you are in a dorm, ask if possible to get a dorm on the back."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"the hostel was great. absolute perfect location. bus right out the front of the hostel gets you everywhere.. well gets you almost everywhere but links you to absolutely everything... was awesome!   my only  gripe was the bus driver to the airport... he got me there late, had his radio up so loud i could barely hear myself think and he was rude. it says that its $15 for the pick up but because i was the only person he picked up from my hostel he demanded $20. ruined my la experience"
England,Female,25-30,6.7,0,6,8,0,8,4,8,"hostel was on the whole good. location was very good for exploring hollywood, a 20 min bus ride took you where you wanted to go. the not so great rating cones from the fact that we booked this hostel partly because of the free activities etc described on the website. free breakfast was average, tea, coffee, cereal, toast. i've had better. the free night out was a no-go, there were not enough shuttles to get everyone to the viper room and so the shuttle that came back to get the rest of us ended"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,10,"really nice, clean private room however didnt get any sleep due to other guests partying which is what you expect in a hostel however the noise seemed to travel through the vents so it was like we were in the same room! for this reason i wouldn't stay again."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel!!!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,so happy with the hostle. best hostle i've ever stayed at! can't wait to go back!!
England,Male,18-24,8,0,6,10,0,6,10,10,great location and stuff organised everynight so always something to do. its a party hostel especially at the weekend so not for people that want a quiet night. most of the staff are really nice but some are miserable. stayed here 3 times now and would definatly stay there again. great free breakfast. bacon and eggs just $2!
Italy,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"lot, but lot of fun..very nice and clean.."
Canada,Couple,18-24,8.7,0,6,8,0,10,10,8,"great place to party. great place to meet people. many organized tours. definitely loved the limo tour on friday night, before going out at the boulevard3 bar.    considering that everything is far in l.a., it took about 1 hour to go anywhere. but, there are a lot of buses and shuttle from the hostel, so it's still ok. the location in itself is relatively safe.    the dorm were ok, a thicker matress would have been appreciated."
Italy,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"very funny and i ,very clean and good location"
USA,Couple,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,great hostel
Australia,Female,18-24,9,0,10,6,0,10,10,10,made some of my fondest memories of my trip here!
USA,Female,41+,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,"they would not allow me to stay because i am american!!!  they said i had to get my fee back from hostel world.  i wrote to hostel world within a half hour of booking banana bungalow west hollywood to tell them this.  i have not received an answer!!!  please check into it.    thank you,   nancy cuevas guzman....  ......sorry, i had to ""rate"" and since they would not allow me to come (i called them as soon as i booked it), i give them a negative rating."
Scotland,Male,18-24,5.3,0,6,8,0,2,4,6,"i really didn't like this place, when i arrived the guy was quite rude and they don't take credit card, which i found extremely strange.    then i wasn't told anything about the place or shown around which i also didn't think was that great.    i stayed for 3 nights and each night they had a massive party in the garden which was far too loud and went on all night."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,6.3,0,8,8,0,4,8,4,"the hostel is great for meeting/hanging out with people but we stayed 4nights and our bathroom and bedroom weren't cleaned once - there was drink stained on the floor and sand all over the bathroom the entire time we were here - not great considering this is the most expensive hostel we've stayed in for the 8months we've been travelling. having said that, we met some great people and the hostel has good facilities for hanging out."
Finland,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,6,"really enjoyed staying there! free barbeques, liked the free breakfast and they provided lots of activities and trips at reasonable prises. at first there was a strong smell which was probably the washing powder but we got used to it. good neighborhood, close to the farmer's market and the grove. we were really pleased, would definitely recommend this hostel!"
France,Female,25-30,8.3,0,6,8,0,8,8,10,"i was really happily surprised by the cleanliness and happy atmosphere of this place! i've been to a lot of hostels, but this one is one of my favorite!!"
England,MixedGroup,25-30,8,0,6,8,0,4,10,10,"the location isn't brilliant, however busses leave from right out the front so it's not really a problem. the free breakfasts &amp; evening activities were great, but if you have a room looking out onto the patio you will be kept awake if you're a light sleeper. it's a great place to meet people, but it's definitely what you make it, because the staff seem bored to death &amp; if do more to bring the atmosphere of the place down than make it seem fun."
Australia,Male,25-30,3.7,0,4,6,0,4,2,2,"arrived at banana bungalow but they moved me to 'orbit' just around the corner.(they own both). i was annoyed at being checked in to a hostel i didn't book!  this review is for orbit but it's their fault if it is bad for banana bungalow  place is pretty dirty - dirty carpets, bathrooms, communal area.    phone card i bought didn't work.  breakfast is basic cereal, white toast and jam or peanut butter.  tea coffee.  all kitchen crockery and cutlery is disposable - not eco friendly! need real plates!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,there were a lot of school kids there when i was there so had to make our own fun with not to many people to socialize with. otherwise fantastic hostel.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,0,10,6,0,8,8,8,"good hostel, very good internet, good area downstairs to make alot of noise if you're into that, the breakfast/bar area outside is cool too. just a bit of a bad location unless all you're interested in is seeing hollywood. we were lucky because we had a car to get to all the beachs..."
France,Female,18-24,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,very friendly staff and good parties. i defenitly love the limousine for going in a bar!!!
Sweden,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,just loved it all! so much fun stuff going on and the staff was friendly and helpful :)
Spain,Couple,25-30,6.3,0,6,8,0,4,10,6,"party, party and more party. it's really noise. we were there on friday-saturday and party finish at 1am. we booked two people together and they put us in diferent bedrooms. if you wanna go to sleep early, don't choose this hostel!! the location and the 5$ dinner are the best thing. they have also problems with wifi"
Australia,Male,41+,6.7,0,8,8,0,6,6,6,"it was fine stay, but  it was bit strange they do not take credit card because  the machine do not work and some time they only take credit card for $40 key deposit and when i return the key they kept a copy of my credit card detail."
Sweden,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"i have stayed at both this banana bungalow and the one in hollywood and they are both great. i really like the atmosphere, parking is free, breakfast is great. the staff is helpful and it is a lot of fun things going on.  the rooms are clean and you get towels for free!  i always stay at banana bungalow when i revisit los angeles."
Denmark,Female,18-24,8,0,10,6,0,6,8,8,"the location isn't the best but there is a bus-stop nearby, and the hostel has trips to disney land, universal studios and a sightseeing you can pay to join and it's a good experience and a good way to see it all :)  it is a good hostel :)"
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,6,i've stayed here twice. typical hostel. except the location is amazing! lots of shops near by and not too expensive for a cab ride to get into hollywood (if that's your thing). it's sister hostels a very close as well.
England,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"we stayed in the orbit as the bungalow was overbooked, really nice safe hostel, with lots going on good free breakfast in the morning and things in the evening. showers were semi decent aswell."

Australia,Female,18-24,7,0,8,8,0,8,8,2,"love this place but did get major bed bug bites on this stay. i love it but be careful of the bugs. stay out of room 204 i guess if you can, or wear clothing all over so they can't bite you all over aaaagh i'm in pain !!!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,have stayed here before and will stay here again. had a lot better room this time so enjoyed it that much more. staff are great and a lotta fun and love the $5 dinners!
Sweden,Female,31-40,9.7,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,go here...the perfect place and the staff are so nice and helpful..but the wifi is not that good..
Australia,Female,18-24,6,0,6,8,0,2,8,6,"this hostel has some pretty good amenities however staff are very unfriendly, rooms aren't the cleanest and there's not such a great vibe to the place. defiantly a party hostel and in a pretty good location. my stay here was pretty average and don't think that i would return."
France,Female,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,great hostel for partying and having fun  one thing is missing : curtain  nice common room
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,0,8,8,0,6,8,8,"this was a pretty good place to say, fairly good location it was all really easy to get everywhere by public transport. the only nuisance was it was next to impossible to try and get to reception and actually have someone there which could be really frustrating. met some awesome people and a lotta fun though!"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,0,6,8,0,4,6,8,"room was run down but clean, the bathroom was scrubbed down everyday which was great. the staff were helpful when you asked for information but definitely weren't friendly or particularly happy - when you work in a hostel you think you'd try to lighten up and welcome people but not here. internet was very slow and rarely worked. the la tour they do is worth it if you don't have much time but expensive for $60us. party room looks like a crack den! will probably try somewhere else next time."
England,Female,18-24,4,0,2,4,0,6,6,2,"the hostel is dirty, unsafe and just generally has a really bad vibe, even the staff seem unhappy. i wouldn't stay here again..."
UK,Male,18-24,6.3,0,6,10,0,4,6,6,"a good hostel to stay in. great location, free breakfast, free internet, but the staff are unfriendly and it can be a little hard to meet people."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"amazing place!!! really nice hostel with a lot of cool activities every day! free beer and activities with the orbit hostel, so you are more people to do the party!!! there is a party room in the basement, so when you come back of the bar, you have a place to go. the free computer to use, it's 3 imac!!!  the dorm are big,  two room connected together of 6 beds, but the people are nice, so it's not a problem.  good location and nice staff. the banana bungalow are always a good place to stay."

SouthAfrica,Female,25-30,8.7,0,8,8,0,8,10,10,this place was ideally located and had a great atmosphere with a tv room upstairs and a pool table. a great backpacker nearby to book trips and have barbeque for free if staying at this hostel. you can take a bus to the hollywood walk of fame and train station. met great people all wanting to become actors( great people). will stay again.
Germany,Male,25-30,6,0,6,8,0,4,6,6,it was ok to stay there for the night.
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"i really enjoyed this hostel concept , ive been to venice before , but i really enjoyed this location , great for walking to everything . i would stay again . things to note there is a quiet time from 10pm -10 am , but there is a tv room you can still talk in , beds are comfy , no large lockers , but there are smaller ones for valuables , bring you own lock . there are communal towels for drying hands after using the restroom so bring hand sanitizer   "
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great people. great location. clean. very fun. 
Sweden,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,"hood location and clean. not so much of an atmosphere, the showers can be fixed and upgraded. little pricey. overall an ok stay"
England,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"podshare venice is located literally 10mins walking distance from venice beachfront. the whole house is very well-built with a lot of amenities, and the staff is super friendly and 'helpful with loads of recommendations! the house also includes a front yard and a small basketball court, what's more to ask for in co-living space! we really enjoy our stay there"
England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,"really cool hostel, love the pods with the tv in each one and the living area as well as the relaxing garden with a basketball court and table tennis. the breakfast was poor so i had to buy my own the second day. 5 minute walk to venice beach and lots of restaurants."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"this was my first experience with dorm-style lodging so i was a little nervous, but for the price i figured it was worth a shot. i'm so glad i did but it was wonderful! perfect for those who really just need a place to put their stuff down and rest their heads at night. i didn't spend too much time hanging around the the property, only because i was busy exploring the city however it was clean, the people were nice, and the location was fantastic! "
Poland,Female,25-30,8,6,10,8,6,8,8,10,"the sleeping pods were amazing, that was definitely my favourite thing about the place. the location isn't bad, but it's still a bit of a walk to get anywhere other than venice beach. i was advised against taking buses so had to uber everywhere - not great, an uber to hollywood (for example) is about $22 one way. the fact it's advertised breakfast is included is a bit misleading - it's just ""being able to use the shared food"" of which there isn't much. "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"really clean, modern-looking hostel. had a super friendly vibe and the staff were very helpful and welcoming. wish i stayed longer! felt very safe and you could borrow the hostels bikes to go for a ride along venice beach or wherever else. will definitely stay here again next time i'm in venice beach"
Hungary,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great overall, super cool place, friendly people. unfortunately there are no locks provided which makes securing your valuables problematic, especially if it turns out on site. so everyone bring a lock!"
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,8,6,8,4,"a so-so hostel experience. the pods are really nice and feel private, the facility was gorgeous and peaceful but not very clean. trash cans overflowing, dirty dishes, no toilet paper sometimes, etc. half the time there was no one at the front desk so when a guest came to check in so they'd just have to wander around trying to find an employee (no name tags or shirts so it's hard to tell who works there and who is a guest). overall i had a decent time but this place needs to be run better."
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great hostel - just not much atmosphere. would be good if they have people a reason to hang in the social area (movie night, free cake one night etc). struggled to meet anyone while here but the hostel really is beautiful. bit pricey but they all are in the us!"
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,4,10,10,10,8,10,the staff were really great. it was suitable to the accommodations i needed.
Canada,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"located just a few blocks off of abbot-kinney, this co-living space is not to be missed if you're looking for a quiet, clean and non-party hostel, this is for you.     the facility is clean, comfortable and equipped with a full kitchen. you are about 10 minutes from venice beach and a few steps from the canals.  staff was pleasant, beds were comfy. the hostel was secure, both inside and out. they have lockers to lock up any valuables. super quiet at night, making it great for non-party travel."
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"pros: big outdoor space. interesting places to walk to.  cons: dirty! wifi was hit or miss. couldn't use tv in bunk because too many other people were signed on to the same account. like the other locations the ""breakfast""  that is supposedly provided seems to just be what was left behind by previous guests and moved into the ""community"" pile. gals working here weren't bad, but also not terribly friendly either. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love this place but never went i tcancelked my reservation but no one ever contacted me to credit my money back as i got sick and had to fly home back to colorado 267-874-1902
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,10,8,"the vibes were chill and the location was amazing! majority of the staff were really friendly and helpful, there were a few times when i had no idea where they were as they weren't at the front desk. the facilities were really cool- computers and basketball court and outdoor furniture available, and a tv in bed. the bathrooms were good, except one toilet door broke- so they were down one. the only thing is there is barely anything for breakfast- i had to buy my own. free bike rental though!"
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,highly recommended! 
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,8,10,8,10,10,amazing facilities and very comfortable beds! would definitely book again. 
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"this hostel is awesome! i love how it's set up. it's super close to both the beach and the venice canals. they had a whole bunch of things you can do outside (sport equipment, a grill, rentable bikes). the staff was extremely nice and the overall atmosphere was good. the only down side i had is that the bathroom stalls are tiny and one of the showers doesn't have a changing room attached to it. but, i had a great stay and definitely will be staying at another podshare whenever i'm in the area :)"
Argentina,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"super recomendable! todo el staff​ super amable.. mi primer noche fue en los cuartos de arriba (que no están muy buenos) e inmediatamente al día siguiente me cambiaron al sector principal!!  el amigo venezolano me dio la bienvenida con 2 margaritas :) el lugar es como se ve en las fotos, cuentan con toallas y la ubicación es excelente!"
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff was awesome! i really loved danny! what a genuinely amazing person. i was a little scared at first, not ever having stayed at a hostel before, but the podshare is a great introduction into space sharing. the property is always clean, calm, and peaceful, even during busy times. i am a very light sleeper, but with the right mind set, i was able to sleep peacefully and soundly in my pod. the personal tvs are an awesome bonus!"
England,Male,25-30,3.7,2,4,6,2,2,4,6,"looks good, functions poorly. no doors on bathrooms, and 3 showers total. rude unhelpful staff."
Canada,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"i stayed at this podshare for a few days. the staff that work here are very open and welcoming. the place itself is surrounded by a nice garden and well secured with a gate. also, it's only a short walk to the beach. you can rent a bike for free, which is a great way to get around. the pods itself look very nice and are completely open. this might be a remark to someone who is searching for privacy. also, the cleanliness of the facilities was not always great. but would recommend for sure!"
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,10,6,"staff were great. location is superb. 5 mins to the boardwalk and beach. 2 mins to abott kinney with funky eateries and decent coffee.  bus stop literally at the front door to help get around la. awesome outdoor area, staff organised yoga and meditation in the morning. i even got free smashed avo on toast on my last day. literally my only gripe has been mentioned here before, the showers are pretty much always filthy. would stay again. "
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"the staff here are great - so friendly and helpful! the hostel itself is about 10 minutes walk from venice beach and boardwalk, 5 minutes from venice canals and 2 minutes from abbot kinney boulevard."
Austria,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"totally awesome hostel w great value for money, located just minutes away (by foot!!) from venice beach and abbot kinney blvd.  very clean, calm at night, the parking lot is handy - only a pool is missing ;) "
Scotland,Female,25-30,8,6,10,6,8,10,6,10,"it’s a really lovely clean and modern hostel with big comfy beds and comfortable sofas and good wifi. there is a kitchen so you can make food and there is a cupboard with stuff people have left that you can use - i made a big bowl of porridge with peanut butter for my breakfast with the leftovers. there isn’t much around the hostel but it’s a short walk from the beach. it’s nice and quiet at night and i slept well. having travelled a lot, this was by far the most expensive hostel i’ve stayed in."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was great. 
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent place to stay. i would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to venice beach or looking to have a base nearby to visit la (provided you have transport)
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, only improvement would be private mirrors i'm each pos but apart from that it was perfect!"
Canada,Female,18-24,6.3,2,8,8,8,4,6,8,"i booked two beds with confirmation emails to prove. they said i was not in their system and that there was a mistake on their end and there were no beds left. i paid the deposit and $30 to get to the place.  in the end they gave me the employee bunk bed section (completely different than what was promised) at full price. no compensation whatsoever and i was left utterly upset . manager insisted that i was promised ""beds"" and that's technically what i am receiving. highly unorganized system."
Brazil,Female,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,6,8,8,6,"i like the place... all made of wood, really cool.... nice place, awesome shower.... but no breakfast at all.... just sugar to ' share'...."
USA,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very clean and well located. the staff were friendly and helpful. the rokus don't  work. that didn't matter much to us because we weren't in the hostel too long, but it's poor form to sell the hostel as being this cool thing with tvs in every pod if they don't actually work. the outside is super nice with basketball and volleyball courts, ping pong, and soccer.  overall it was a positive experience and i would stay again. "
England,Female,25-30,5.1,4,6,6,4,8,4,4,i stayed in a few hostels across america and this was sadly the worst. it could be made a better experience quite easily.     there is no privacy and lockers are tiny. the hostel prides itself on being 'open' but this makes it very unpleasant unless you are with a big group. the bathrooms are small with holes in the door so you can see people in the shower/toilet. there is nowhere to get changed at all so ppl change in the shower causing a queue.     the location with regards to venice is good. 
NewZealand,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,a great place and awesome location. friendly and helpful staff and a peaceful environment. 
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,awesome staff and great facilities. stayed here more than once and will definitely be back again. 
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,6,10,8,"this is much bigger than the los feliz location. with so many more people, it's tougher to keep as clean - but they still do a very good job. location is super close to abbot kinney, and about a 10 minute walk to the beach. parking in a huge + as well as the yard, which includes a ping-pong table, basketball court, volleyball etc. easy to meet people and quiet time after 10pm makes it easy to get a good sleep. my standards might be high from my experience at los feliz, but i highly recommend."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,8,4,4,8,"super comfy beds not so clean bathrooms! staff didn't seem to know a lot about the area. maps/flyers would have helped a lot. backyard area is nice at all times of the day. although, there was not a lot of furniture so it made it a bit awkward to meet people. the furniture that was there was pretty old. the space would benefit from fixing up the communal areas. "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place, great starff! "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel with great sized beds.  it's also in a good location. negatives would be bathroom stalls just had wooden slat folding doors and no big lockers for your bags, but nothing was stolen and i didn't really fear anything would be."
England,Female,25-30,3.7,2,6,6,2,2,2,6,"the property would not let me stay here because my flight was delayed and wanted to charge me double for one night.     they refused to get back to me properly about it within 24 hours, knowing this would make my booking invalid for change in anyway.    horrendously disappointing.    not so 'community' based from my experience."
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,since there's not much information about this place since it's so new i wrote a long review and uploaded it to google drive; https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bx5h5lq1xlagzxu1wnf4zm5hz0e/view?usp=sharing    the short version is that it is a nice place and i'd recommend it. not perfect for light sleepers or party people. no place to hang out with people after 10 pm which was too bad. not much privacy but felt safe. easy to meet people and good location. i had a good night's sleep. 
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,6,10,10,"amazing place to go and everyone very friendly, felt the staff could have been more involved and didn't know who were staff and who were hostel users so didn't know who to address. would 100% recommend, no faults at all. pictures didn't do it justice, amazing experience. lovely sporting facilities and great space to hang out. shame they don't have a social area after 10pm but if it's warm, outside is more than substantial. i didn't use the lockers provided because the environment felt so safe."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,super cute place. really well kept and modern. nice bathrooms and showers.
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8,10,6,10,10,2,8,10,"awesome accommodation, however the staff weren't too friendly which was surprising for a hostel. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,sensation hostel with the best staff.   staff were always available and would detailed any help needed to get to where you wanted to go.
Switzerland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a great stay and prolonged one night to four nights because it was such a nice place to be and the staff were very friendly and helpful! breakfast is basic but we took the opportunity to use the kitchen and just made our own ""healthy"" ;-) breakfast. i can totally recommend this place, be it travelling alone, as a couple and maybe even with children!"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very cozy and close to everything! 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely wonderful time spent here! extremely polite, friendly and helpful staff. plus, you're bound to meet amazing people here. you'll be charmed by the vintage interior of the hostel which harkens back to the golden age of hollywood. highly recommend it."
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,me and my boyfriend had a great experience at this hostel. would definitely come back.
Canada,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"a fantastic stay.  really felt more like a hotel- clean, quiet and cozy.  stayed in a private room with 2 twin beds and was completely satisfied.  lots of bathrooms and shower rooms in the halls- all single use that i saw.  every time i went into one it had just been cleaned.  there seemed to be a fair amount of the private rooms.  lots of local info in the lobby- the hostels own handouts were very informative.  i will stay there again- most likely every time i'm in the area."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"a different kind of hostel - very cool!   everything was clean, the rooms were good, location is perfect!  to be improved: breakfast only consisted of waffles.   would go again!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this place was very nice and felt very safe. the location was perfect, being that it was walking distance from hollywood blvd. the receptionist was very kind and helpful, even gave me some recommendations for places to go while i was there. plus they even had amenities that you could check out like computer chargers and wall adapters in case you needed it. i will definitely stay here again! "
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the property was beautiful,, the staff went out of their way to be helpful, it's a block away from the center of the hollywood attractions, and it even has parking. i will definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends who are travelling to los angeles."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the location is really excellent for all things that you might want to do in the area, the staff were really helpful and very accomodating with all requests and really helpful when we asked them about anything. the rooms are basic but comfortable, very secure and safe though. "
USA,Female,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"fabulous location at a reasonable price. lovely rambling old home that once was a boarding house for up and coming, now famous, stars. rooms nice but small. our room was in the basement, small, and alittle noisy at times because it was right next to the common tv/kitchen/lounge; computer space and lockers; and next to staff parking spaces. it tended to be stuffy. staff generally helpful and available.  very clean. breakfast was basic, however, the make-it-yourself waffles were great. "
India,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very quiet and well-maintained property. location is probably the best part about the hostel: just a minute away from the walk of fame. although the breakfast is not too great, there is always tea, coffee or hot cocoa available. definitely recommend staying here, if you are looking for a quiet and restful end after a hectic and busy day. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,6,8,8,8,10,great deal with the bike rental place; $16/day 
USA,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,loved the demographics of being within the vicinity  of everything! staff was wonderful. i enjoyed speaking with other travelers that stayed at the hostel as well. i'll definitely be back!
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"a pleasant location, clean, loved the old house. it would be nice to have small reading lights next to each bed. one bright overhead light was the only room light. i used my iphone light at night while reading so i wouldn’t disturb my roommate. it was convenient to restaurants &amp; tourist attractions."
NorthernIreland,Female,41+,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"nice place, good value and very helpful and friendly staff.  the facilities are good, i enjoyed being able to make a decent breakfast with the food they set out every morning.  it had a nice atmosphere and the location is great - quiet and peaceful while being incredibly convenient."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a great stay, lovely garden, close to everything, we were able to walk to our function, breakfast, dinner, but quiet atmosphere.  i would recommend anyone to stay in this historic, lovely hostel. "

Brazil,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,10,6,"great location, confortable private room and very silent, it’s not a party hostel. "
England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,location is good but still very quiet which is great. we were in a private room which was very large and clean. the only downside was that we were each asked for a $40 cash deposit for a room key which wasn't mentioned anywhere previously. luckily we all had cash on us but i wasn't very happy to have to give all this over without any prior warning. 
Brazil,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,great place to stay
Finland,Female,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,6,10,"beautiful old mansion and great location near metro, shops, restaurants, hollywood sights &amp; runyon canyon. staff was super friendly. the place has private rooms and dorms and the atmosphere is more like a guesthouse than hostel. i found the dorms overpriced. compared to other dorms in la, they're more pricey &amp; you don't get value for your money or any freebies. lockers should be in the rooms and not in the basement. dorms also need individual lights &amp; power plugs. check-out is too early at 10.

England,Male,25-30,6,8,6,10,4,6,4,4,"i’ve stayed here three times in total, the first two being when it wasn’t very busy in january. the advantages of the hostel are the location and overall cost. the third time ruined it for me because of the noise as i could hear every other guest in the hostel. we were located by a staircase and were constantly woken by the frequent use of the stairs as well as the rooms adjacent and above; after 4 nights i was exhausted. the room was unfortunately and noticeably less clean this time too. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it is across the street from the magic castle! 
TrinidadAndTobago,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great location within walking distance to lots of shops, restaurants and the metro but on a side street away from all the noise and safe to walk at night. front desk staff were amazing (thank you pedro, beatrice &amp; laura). rooms were clean. "

USA,Male,18-24,7.7,6,10,8,6,6,8,10,"i had a decent stay. it was extremely hot in the basement room that i stayed in. they need ac in all of the rooms. i was a little annoyed when i was told i could not receive my key deposit unless i grabbed the sheets/blankets off my bed at 4:30am, which disturbed my roommates during the middle of the night. "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"great location only a minutes walk from all the action on hollywood boulevard. the staff were so helpful in giving directions, recommending what to see and do and helping book transportation! he really went out of his way to help out. the breakfast provided was really good. room was a good size and clean however the bed was a little small."
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"it's perfect. the only thing is that there is not too much atmosphere here, and no outlets in the garden in case you need to use your computer outside but besides that, it's perfect to rest and have a good stay in la :)"
England,Male,18-24,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,"very basic, and the lady that served at the front desk was very rude to my group. facilities in the kitchen were not great, and basic things around the building need work (such as taps or locks not working). very small lockers also, so if you plan on having a big suitcase i probably wouldn't recommend here. location is right next to hollywood boulevard which was good, and the only thing giving the staff a somewhat decent review is the guy who served us the next day. "
England,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,"only used this as a stop over, but the location is perfect for hollywood, a bit far from the beaches though. the staff were really welcoming and friendly. overall the hostel was clean and welcoming. i would definitely recommend. "
England,Couple,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,"location is really good, off main walk of fame.   car park is available- payment required  the hostel is a large building, several rooms etc we had a private room which was adequate.  staff at reception really friendly and informative. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"the host was welcoming as i stepped through the buzz-in front door. clean carpet and nice wood walls in the lobby, it was well kept. parking was available and felt safe. as i stayed in a 4 male room, it could have been a little cooler than it was, but the bed was comfy and clean. sure, the restrooms were tight but they were clean. the backyard was welcoming and the kitchen well stocked with pans, plates and cutlery. i would recommend this hostel. "
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,"great location&amp; staff was very helpful. good security and we felt very safe. super helpful that the hostel had print outs of places to go and directions about how to get around town. we booked a private room and we're a little disappointed in the size, it was very small. also there was no air conditioning in our room specifically, there was ac in dorm rooms. in la in august not having ac isn't easy and we had difficultly sleeping we were so hot. overall a decent stay, would stay again if had ac."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an amazing stay at this hostel. beautiful renovated mansion a block away from hollywood blvd. clean, peaceful, and parking in the back ($10 / night). staff are really friendly and accommodating. highly recommend :)."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place is amazing. this is review is geared to my fellow americans: don't be afraid to stay in a hostel!!!! the location cannot be beat. you are literally around the corner from hollywood blvd and many other major tourist attractions. you are also very close to public transportation which the hostel is very helpful with finding your way around on it. the price is unbeatable for the location if you book early enough. best hostel you could stay in in la
England,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"a fantastic base for visiting la. my husband and i stayed in a private room, which was very comfortable, our daughter stayed in a dorm, which was also good. staff were very friendly and helpful and the make-it-yourself breakfast was a bonus. the only downside was that the kitchen is rather small for a number of people trying to make waffles or pancakes at the same time and no dishwasher makes proper dish-cleaning an issue. however, i would highly recommend this hostel. "
Kazakhstan,Male,18-24,5.7,6,6,8,4,2,8,6,"beware of the basement rooms and $20 deposit. tiny kitchen and tiny bathrooms. nice atmosphere and location. i had a very negative experience with the front desk receptionist. she was extremely rude, unpleasant, confrontational, and unprofessional."
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"i stayed for two nights. the man on reception was really helpful and gave me good tips about hiking to the hollywood sign. he was happy to help anyone that asked for advice. the hostel is located around a two minute walk to the main part of the hollywood strip and 10 mins from runyon canyon. so it was good to be in the thick of the action. i stayed in a six bed dorm with en suite, it had air con. the breakfast is pretty decent you get pancakes or waffles. would recommend for a short stay.

India,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hi,   i stayed there for two night. the hostel location is nice and walkable distance from the nearest metro station. the staff is very co-operative and always ready to help. they have great travel guide handouts and maps to help you navigate and plan your trip.   awesome place to stay with a reasonable amount.

NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,wonderful location. not too noisy at night but a really close walk to hollywood bl. friendly staff and was tidy when we arrived. did have to keep asking for the air conditioning to be turned on.
USA,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my first ever private room rental and it was fantastic.  the hostel was clean, people were nice, and it was close to the things i wanted to see on my short trip to los angeles.  the hostel was quiet and i slept very well.  "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an amazing time staying at orange drive for my first ever hostel experience. the location was absolutely great, and the amenities were very good, from great wifi, to kitchen access and multiple fridges and freezers, i really felt comfortable throughout my 5 nights. it was so good i stayed an extra night, and wish i had of stayed a few more! staff were also very great and super accommodating, cannot recommend enough. safety seemed to be a strong point for orange drive, great work."
Canada,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,"has a nice homie character but lacks a welcoming atmosphere. no real inviting communal area. $10 per night parking adds to the price. free breakfast is make your own waffles/pancakes. would've been nice to have a/c in the lower level rooms. saw a cockroach come out of one of the lower level showers. front desk lady didn't admit to any faults to the hostel, giving a vibe that that's normal or not out of the ordinary. very nonchalant. would've been nice if she had a better attitude about it all. "
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,10,10,8,10,"great place! the staff is very helpful and friendly, and the location is great: right off hollywood boulevard from where plenty of buses can take you to different places. it is expensive for a hostel, but i guess that's anywhere in la."

Australia,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,great everything.. excellent price and location :)
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"the staff asked for a $20 security deposit for the room key, which wasn't mentioned in the description. that was a bit of a hassle but otherwise a very relaxing hostel in a great location!"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a great stay at orange drive hostel. one of my favourite places i've stayed. i love that the place has a garden and multiple bathrooms! the only downside is that there are not a lot of electrical plugs in each room. 
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,great spot - easy access to major hollywoid attractions and the metro! double rooms as well as dorms are ok-nice. especially the garden/patio is great to relax and have breakfast. overall quite calm for a hostel in that location! would come back again! 
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location a short walk to hollywood blvd, facilities were very good with a good well equipped kitchen best of all are the staff who are extremely helpful and courteous. "

Wales,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,"in the heart of hollywood. seconds away from the walk of fame and tcl theatre and only a 30 minute walk from the great runyon canyon. modern, clean room and free breakfast, yum!"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my stay was wonderful. the staff was very kind and welcoming! the hostel was not only super clean, but super cool! i loved my room, it felt like a luxury hostel. the location is awesome too; right near hollywood boulevard. i also enjoyed walking through some nice neighborhoods nearby."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"good location, close to the hollywood walk of fame and chinese theatre. older style place so some of the features are dated but clean and comfy and a nice quiet vibe. staff were helpful and friendly. "
Argentina,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,10,8,6,8,"great hostel in a very nice house. the location is perfect and even it's located in the tourist zone of hollywood is very quiet for being one block away from the main avenue.  nice beds, and a very nice park for having breakfast, drink something or just relax. the staff is very helpful and friendly.  cheap parking if you rent a car and fair room price."
Canada,Couple,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"loved this hostel! great location, the staff were very knowledgeable &amp; extremely friendly, breakfast was good (although a bit limited), and they had very helpful handouts at the front desk with tourist warnings! only downsides were limited parking, the bed was extremely hard, and the bathrooms had very small sinks that led to water on the ground from other guests washing their faces. overall great for our short stay &amp; would stay again! :)"
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"had a great stay! literally the best location to some of the coolest places in hollywood - a quiet street about 100 metres from all the action. staff were lovely, and it's a wonderful old house with loads of character - plus you can't beat free waffles! one recommendation: it would be great if they did laundry with less heavily scented detergent as when we checked in, the scent of the freshly washed linen overwhelmed the room like french perfume and we had to ventilate for a few hours. 9.5/10!"
England,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location very near dolby cinema and chinese theatre and hollywood/highland metro - but next to hollywood tat as well. easy to get to on red metro line from union station. feels safe in a tourist area. quiet hostel. 
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"the orange drive hostel is very good. it's clean, with friendly staff and in a good area. i stayed in a twin room with ensuite.  it is very well located, and offers excellent value for money."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"wish i had not left my expensive perishable food in the kitchen (fridge) overnight for my last night there, someone was more hungry than i, but it's ok.  another lesson learned. "

SouthKorea,Female,25-30,5.4,4,8,8,4,4,6,4,"we called airport shuttle at front desk.  but we waited 30min over, the staff does't care of us. finally, we could't take airport shuttle  and then we were late at airport.  i was very disappointed of it.  we paid 4 dollars for call shuttle, but we did't refund of it.  it was terrible of day."
Finland,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,6,10,good location and pretty good value for money. the breakfast included was actually not a prepared breakfast and instead there's just waffle ingredients (and nothing else) and you have to cook it yourself. other than that this place was quite lovely although a bit pricey (90$ for twin room) for a back packer budget. 
Ukraine,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i want to say special thanks to staff for being very helpful and really willing to help!
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent location, beautiful rooms and at such a great price"
England,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,6,10,fantastic right in the middle of the action and yet so calm
France,Female,25-30,8.9,6,10,10,10,10,6,10,"amazing location, right by the metro red line so perfect to get around downtown and santa monica if you don't have a car. staff are really great gave us loads of tips and advice for things to see. room was lovely, breakfast is great, make it yourself also has a kitchen if you want to make your own meals. feels more like a b and b than a hostel but perfect for a few days stop in hollywood! "
Italy,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"great location, great place, very clean and comfortable.  my only point would have been to add a curfew to the kitchen as it can get too noisy and people tend to use it at all time even during the night."
Australia,Couple,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"fantastic location seconds from all the action yet blissfully quiet and comfortable. very helpfull staff. alejandro especially. great facilities all functioning well with a decent breakfast free in the kitchen. plenty of information in the foyer with free mints and pens plus you get a ""beware if local scams"" type info sheet which is invaluable to those who are new to the hustle of la.  i couldnt recomend this place enough."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i loved this place!!! checking in, the woman was so nice and helpful...but checking out someone else was super short with me and didn't even give me the chance to ask her questions like i was trying to.   the location is perfect! walking distance to the walk of fame, but far enough away that it was quiet for sleeping.   my room was comfy and clean, my bed was phenomenal. it was better than my bed at home!  i wish it was a little cheaper, but other than that i loved it."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"the staff are so friendly and helpful! ready to go above and beyond if you need help. the location could not be beat with only just a few minutes walk from the action of the hollywood strip. our private room was basic but comfortable and tidy although the walls are thin. shared bathrooms were clean and plenty of hot water. breakfast was basic but sufficient with oats, pancakes and waffles. this is not a party hostel. all in all this hostel was excellent! "
Ireland,Male,31-40,4,2,4,10,2,2,6,2,"booked a single room. the good stuff.... the location cannot be beat &amp; it is a quiet hostel if you're not a party animal.   the bad.... single room was not clean or well-maintained. poorly furnished, old bed, several things needed fixed in the room. air-con broken, window would not close so noisy and security risk. staff are lethargic (check-in took 20mins!) &amp; not welcoming. breakfast is appalling so best forget it!   chain hotels in suburbs provide much better value for money at the same price.  "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,orange drive hostel is a little piece of paradise! i cannot recommend it any more highly!    a special mention to beatrice (front desk employee) -  she was so helpful and caring. really friendly and sincere.     i stayed in a private room and it was gorgeous; i felt really safe and slept in peace on a comfortable bed.     there was always a toilet or bathroom to use and it's generally very clean and inviting.     there are free waffles and a selection of breakfast items which were great! 
England,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,6,8,"hostel is in great location, literally 2 minute walk from hollywood walk of fame and everything that surrounds it. free breakfast is great. only negative was our room which was right above the kitchen area which was very noisy from 6.30am every day and during the night, one night in particular at 3.30am. ask for a room away from the kitchen area. apart from that very nice hostel. we had a private room, bathroom was fine. "
Canada,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,8,8,"very cute hostel located few minutes walk from hollywood blvd. the hostel was well maintained and very quiet for those who are looking for more of a relaxed vibe. i stayed in a private room which ended up being a bit more cramped than i had expected. it is a heritage building which is very cool but also aged in many ways, as well it has a cramped feel to it in some of the common areas (bathrooms, kitchen, tv room) and lack comfortable seating to watch tv or just chill. overall, great place."
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,just a fantastic place.
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"this was a first experience for staying in a hostel.  it was a great stay, even though it was only 1 night.  if i am in the area again, i plan to stay at the hostel [if available].  stayed in a private room with private bathroom.  it was just perfect [other than no tv in the room, but understandable as to why none].  the coffee was hot and perfect to wake up to, plus having the free waffles helped to start the day off perfectly. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"perfect location for sightseeing in hollywood. close enough to the action, but on a quiet street away from the crowds and noise. not a party hostel. very friendly, kind, helpful staff. convenient atm downstairs. small bathrooms (single stall), but i had no trouble finding an available one down the hall or on a different floor. never got a chance to try the free waffle breakfast, since it was always crowded and i was constantly on the go, but it smelled amazing. would definitely stay here again. "
Australia,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel is really lovely. it is in a quiet spot, just a couple of minutes walk to the hollywood stars walk. the laundry is really handy and the breakfast is great (the kitchen is small). i noticed that this place is super clean and well maintained. they even have covers on the mattresses that protect against bed bugs. i would highly recommend this hostel for all ages and types of travellers as it has a mix of rooms. although it isn't right in the action, everything is easy to get to."
Guatemala,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing experience from the start. location is great, within 1 block of subway and bus station. staff is extremely helpful and nice. everything is clean and feels more like a house than a hostel. bathrooms are individual and not shared, which means you can have that extra privacy. and to top it all, its cheaper than any other hostel i´ve stayed. definitely would recommend it. the only thing i would improve is the breakfast. i would add a few more options (specially fruits)."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"my boyfriend came across this hostel while we were trying to plan a trip to la and looking for hotels. we were both a little spectacle about staying in a hostel but decided to take a chance and we were greatly surprised with our experience :) we were discussing our next trip back to stay at this hostel before we even checked out lol.  beautiful old, historic estate with charm and comfort, reasonably priced, plus absolute prime location!"
Canada,Female,41+,5.7,4,6,8,4,8,6,4,"the breakfast is too simple, room is small, hot. and one of the locker on the door is useless. most of all people talk so loud until midnight, couldn't sleep. "

Scotland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was great. friendly staff who were more than happy to help to offer valuable advice to many travellers. good free breakfast. good shuttle bus transport. 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a very nice hostel with a kind staff. the location was good, near the hollywood walk of fame, but on a side road so it wasn't loud. the people staying in my room were quiet and respectful. and the free breakfast was good!"
Taiwan,Female,25-30,6,4,8,10,4,6,6,4,the bunk bed was difficult to get on and there was no power outlet near the bunk beds  shower was very small and not very clean

Brazil,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"very close to hollywood, near shopping/restaurant areas. because it`s right off the main road, it`s still near all the attractions but it was quite and calm at night. not the party vibe hostel, but that`s what i wanted. stayed in a private bedroom, very comfortable bed, small but functional bathroom. staff were great, incredibly helpful and polite. there`s a subway close to the hostel, and it was very convenient getting to universal studios. a short cab ride to the grove. overall a great stay. "
Australia,Couple,25-30,6.6,4,6,10,6,8,6,6,"very average hostel, facilities run down &amp; in need of an update. great location close to hollywood attractions. we stayed in a private room that was very small &amp; cramped for the high price. there was hair on our bed sheets. room was not well sealed with a cold draft coming through the windows. on check out, we asked reception if they could store our bags at but the storage is just in the foyer area &amp; not very secure at all. the response was 'we take no responsibility for your bags'.

SouthKorea,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect location
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,well located hostel off hollywood boulevard with clean rooms and good kitchen facilities.
Thailand,Female,31-40,5.7,6,4,10,2,6,6,6,"location is perfect, other things else is average.  it's a pretty white house in the perfect location in la which is very easy to go everywhere.  others are average and need big improvement on facilities.  - no drinking water tank to refill, only hot water provided  - need to pay for towel rent. from my experience, most hostel provide towel  - too small kitchen/dining: there are only 2 small tables, diy breakfast is ok  - no headlamp, no electricity outlet at each bed  "
HongKong,Female,25-30,8.6,10,6,10,8,10,8,8,very close to chinese theatre and hollywood walk of fame. my room was comfortable. friendly staff.

HongKong,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"the location is great as it is very close to the hollywood and it will be very convenient especially when you visit universal studios. however, the toilets and the bathrooms are extremely small while the rooms are small as well. btw you have to cook the pancakes and waffles by yourself as they provide the ingredients. "
Spain,Female,31-40,7.1,6,10,8,4,8,8,6,"good location.  staff : ok and peter really nice.  poor breakfast,  at commun toilettes and kitchen were cloth towels to dry hands which is not healthy.  it is convenient and great to change towels per paper."

USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is great. the location was difficult due to being less than a block from the busiest part of hollywood boulevard (intense traffic and random people wandering around), but the parking was very nice and there was always stuff to see. the staff is great and flexible. i also really appreciated the wooden bunks because it cut down on the inevitable noise. the house is an old mansion so while the layout is a little confusing, it's got great atmosphere. overall, i'd definitely recommend it."
USA,Female,41+,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"as a native of los angeles, i still have family and business in the area. the orange street hostel is in a terrific central location in l.a., so i don't have to deal with my sister's dogs that try to sleep with me. the parking lot in the back is an extra bonus! the whole place is clean and friendly. it's also nice to get some good coffee and a fresh waffle in the morning. fellow hostellers, definitely check this one out!"

England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"hostel is in a good location, on a surprisingly nice quiet toad considering it is just off hollywood boulevard! it's also very close to attractions such as the griffith observatory and universal studios (short uber drive away) our room was nice, we did have a slight any problem though! i also think the room numbers need to be clearer as we had people trying to get into our bedroom on several occasions in the middle of the night i assume confusing it with the bathroom! staff nice, good value. "
Portugal,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,6,10,"i was impressed by how well located this hostel is. i loved how you can have breakfast in the courtyard, lovely in sunny days! the only thing i would have enjoyed better was having a lamp for each bed so i could change without waking up others or read before sleep. pedro, was always very calm and helpfull all times. i will come back and recomend the hostel to my friends for sure!"

Israel,Female,31-40,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,4,8,double room isn't really a double; bed is super small. not much of an atmosphere. ok for a couple of nights.
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,10,6,8,6,6,6,8,"nice quiet little hostel.  nothing special really.  was bummed that they don't really have lockers for your luggage (just small ones for valuables).  beds are made of wood, wood is quiet unlike the squeaky metal ones you find in many other hostels.  i would stay here again without hesitation."
Argentina,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is so quiet and at the same time really well located on hollywood area. its very cozy and home style. you also get very good information about whatever you feel like doing in la. the dorms are huge and not crowded with tons of beds. i loved it, it felt like being at home. thank you so much for everything!

USA,MixedGroup,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,6,10,"perfect location for hollywood. also very accessible to bus lines and rail (red line). we easily got from the hostel to lacma / la brea tar pits and then to santa monica by bus and rail. pedro? at the front desk was friendly and helpful. we didn't spend much time at the hostel, but we used the laundry ($6/load incl. detergent) and made free waffles and tea in the kitchen. the latter was a little chaotic, because there were so many guests trying to use the small kitchen at the same time."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wow, this place is great!! it's got everything you need, and in a crazy neighborhood like hollywood i was shocked that parking was so easy! and secure... super convenient!"

USA,Male,31-40,8,6,6,8,10,8,8,10,"the space was really tight. small doors to the rooms, small restroom but for one person it should be really nice actually. i&amp;#39;m a little dude so i fit good. i would have been upset if i was a really big dude. there was some construction going on that i wasn&amp;#39;t told about and if it had rained, the room would have gotten completely flooded because of a door in the room. i&amp;#39;m sure they will have that fixed very soon. the dining room was really small. "
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,honestly blown away by how great this place was. i arrived from scotland with a ton of luggage to stay in california for a year and was surprised at how great the location was of the hostel - 30 seconds from madame tausauds! when you&amp;#39;re on the walk of fame you can get some dodgy streets that surround it but this one was safe and friendly. room lacked having a bedside lamp but apart from that it had everything you could ask for. definitely staying here again when i next go to la!
Hungary,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, wonderful stay, kind staff."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,"fantastic and friendly staff. easy location and a relaxed atmosphere. perhaps a bit pricy. but the staff are generous with there time and help and always had a smile. breakfast was make your own pancakes and waffles, the kitchen was very small so hard to have a lot going on in there at once. "
Australia,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"my husband and i stayed for 3 nights. we are mature travellers and we&amp;#39;re made to feel very welcome. the included breakfast was great and the desk staff were very helpful with information regarding tours and fights. 2 minute walk to hollywood blvd, so location, location!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"in a quiet street off the main section of hollywood boulevard. can catch the beginning of the hop on hop off tour close by (best sightseeing/transport option), or walk runyon canyon. beautiful home. comfortable beds with power points by bed. plenty bathrooms. areas to hang out inside and outside. excellent value."
Australia,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,great location very helpful staff would stay here again
Lithuania,Couple,25-30,8.3,10,6,10,8,10,6,8,"we stayed there for two nights in august 2016. booked it because of location, cheap price and good reviews.  double room with shower and breakfast cost very cheap compared to other ho(s)tels in hollywood. the reception staff were amazingly helpful and welcoming. they answered all my questions about the area, hollywood bowl, grocery shops etc. bravo. parking is very very cheap (7$), but not guarranteed.  the atmosphere was not hostel-like - very quiet. breakfast could have been better."
Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,the hostel was just what i expected and i found the staff more than excellent. i really enjoyed my stay. the facilities are fine and the breakfast sufficient. the small kitchen is ok and makes people talk more in the morning. the atmosphere is excellent. there are nice green grass lawn outside to sit on and relax and have a beer or whatever.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the service was good, free breakfast was awesome and the location was great. the hostel had so much information &amp; things to help you out with your stay. the bathrooms were cleaned often and security was very good."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location. nice staff. includes waffles for breakfast.
England,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good location for visiting hollywood - near shops, restaurants, movie theatres.  lots of local information available.    facilities very good though kitchen rather small. good place for meeting people though. seats and tables outside in the garden where you could sit in the shade.  we liked the diy waffles for breakfast."
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,"this hostel is very well located if you are planning visiting universal studios, walk of fame or hollywood bowl among others in hollywood. is incredible the contrast you find being so close to the crowded boulevard! you can go out for a walk and arrive back to a pacific hostel with well cared open spaces and quiet rooms to relax before going out again (: breakfast is quite good, rooms tend to be way too hot (no ac) and if you are planning on spending several days on the beach it is very far. "
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic location within 2mins walking to walk of fame/chinese theatre. the staff were really friendly and helpful. rooms &amp; hostel were clean and nice. very homely hostal (looks like a hour). this is a little gem in the perfect location. highly recommend staying here. 
Thailand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is the best ever, believe me !"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in. so close to everything and really friendly staff. rooms stylish and clean. would definitely recommend! 
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,really enjoyed my stay. great location and i felt very safe. i was able to check in early and staff were very helpful.
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,8,6,we had pre-booked a parking spot but when we arrived we where told that it was under construction and that we had to use a public one which cost $15 instead of $7. there was no apology or anything. also the check-in process took almost 15 minutes per guest which was way too long.  the room itself was good enough and the waffles for breakfast were nice. the location is definitely unbeatable.
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels i have ever stayed in. staff were very helpful and the facilities were in great condition.
England,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"this place is a great hostel. the kitchen is small but this didn&amp;#39;t affect the access to breakfast, which was great.  if you are interested in seeing hollywood and heading to places like universal studios then it is a great location.  it is a fair trek from the beach but was easy access by bus.  there was lots of information on hand for different stuff to do in the area.  "
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"this little hostel was a great find, quiet and tranquil, and right off crazy, bustling hollywood boulevard!  i liked the old fashioned feel of the place.  this is not a party hostel, there are several of those in town.  i met families with young children, older travelers (like myself) and young adults, this is a place for everyone.       they say they are putting in air conditioning after the roof is replaced which will make this a perfect place to stay.  i would stay here again!    "
Belgium,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great staff!  great location, right on hollywood boulevard and not noisy!  just a thing, if you can, ask for a room upstairs. we had one downstairs near the kitchen and lockers, there was a lot of noise coming from the kitchen/tv area all the time.  "
Austria,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,nice and clean laid back hostel close to all the action in hollywood. 
England,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"overall stay was six nights and honestly i barely have a bad word to say about the place. extremely polite and helpful staff, always clean facilitys, full kitchen with free breakfast (mmm waffles), smoking area. the location really is a minute from hollywood blvd. the only warning i can give is there is no air-conditioning, so can be a bit warm at night but there is a fan in every room. but for the price its fantastic, everywhere else around is $100+ a night. highly recommended       "
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this hostel is in the most amazing location. you are 30 seconds from hollywood boulevard and the walk of fame. the free breakfast of waffles and pancakes is delicious and the rooms are very cosy. i loved it here!!!
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"the hostel is very clean – among the cleanest hostel i&amp;#39;ve stayed in. pedro at the front desk was very informative on local attractions. the location was great. though just a few minute walk from the hollywood attractions, it was very quiet. on the downside there is no ac, so the sleep is quite uncomfortable. the kitchen could use a fan as it is very hot down there with the cooking. there is not much of a social environment as people pretty much keep to themselves. great hostel overall."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i&amp;#39;ve stayed here 3 times now and its always a pleasure! highly recommended :)
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,4,10,8,4,"very friendly staff right off of hollywood blvd. my room was on the top floor and was very hot. no ac. the wifi worked half the time.  room seemed clean, but we did find a dead cockroach in the bathroom. breakfast is free but nothing special. i would not stay here again."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"loved my stay here, quiet and safe. bit far from some places such as approx 1 hr on the train to santa monica and 2 hrs public transport to disneyland, but very close to hollywood bvd and universal studios. staff were super helpful and everything was clean. kitchen is very small but easy enough to work around. something other than waffles or pancakes in the free breakfast would have been nice but hey its free so can&amp;#39;t complain much! would stay again for sure."
Chile,Female,31-40,7.7,6,10,10,2,10,6,10,"nice house, clean and great location right next to the walk of fame in hollywood. but being a hostel owner myself i will suggest investing some money and setting ac in the rooms. i stayed in the female shared dorm and it was extremely uncomfortable to sleep because it was too hot at night!  no hostel vibe, hard to meet other travelers and no organized events so i just stayed for one night and left."
Finland,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i had such a nice  5-night stay at the hostel that i would definitely stay there again. i stayed by myself in the private ensuite room: a lovely space at the top floor. everything was clean and in good condition (however, room was not cleaned during my stay - perhaps it was the hostel policy). stay included free breakfast with coffee and do-them-yourself pancakes. hostel also had a free wi-fi. the staff was very friendly, and always happy to answer all the questions that the travellers had."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we had a fantastic time
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"hostel on orange drive is a nice p;ace to stay. well situated to hollwood blvd.,   i enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere of this hostel , especially for the end of my trip.  all the staff were helpful, polite.   whole building was clean and beautiful and sound did not carry from room to room.   "
Brazil,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,"great place for the price, but nothing special. the bathroom didn&amp;#39;t seem particularly clean and the bed and pillow were not exactly comfortable, but were great for a one night stay."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel i&amp;#39;ve ever used! an amazing location, warm staffs, neat and clean rooms. can&amp;#39;t ask more for the price!!!"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great stay and awesome location!
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,i stayed at this hostel for 7 days. it was amazing. they have a wonderful and friendly staff that are willing to help you out in away and they make you feel totally comfortable. the room was nice and it was quiet. i met some amazing people from all over the world. starline tours is close by if you have tours booked with them. hollywood blvd is right down the street. breakfast was great. i would recommend this to anyone thats touring la. i would stay there again for sure.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved orange drive hostel. it was conveniently located only less that 5-minute walk to the center of hollywood boulevard. when my boyfriend and i arrived, we were pleased to find a charmingly restored historic house with faultless facilities for anyone on a restricted budget not wanting to compromise on quality and comfort. i would gladly stay here again on my next visit to hollywood! "
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"awesome location, you yarn every morning inside the hottest block of hollywood. pedro at the front desk is extremely courteous, helpful and can give you very good hints about the attractions all over southern california.    dorms are big, clean and beds are confortable. lockers are the standard for hostel, which means it&amp;#39;s not large enough for a travel suitcase but very safe for your personal valuables.    definitively a good place to rest after l.a. thrills, but not to hostel parties.        "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a one-bed private room, and was very pleasantly surprised with this hostel. location, facility, lodging, staff, the whole thing.    clean rooms, clean bathrooms, fantastic hollywood location, shout-out to pedro who checked me in, he was an awesome dude and walked me right to my room.     highly recommended!!!!!"
England,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,fantastic place to  stay.  if you are looking for something a bit quieter than the average hostel then the orange drive hostel is definitely recommended.  great location too.
England,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,quite liked this hostel which has a bit of history to it. location was brilliant being a 2 min walk to dolby theatre and kodak theatre. rooms were spacious and not jam packed with people. staff were friendly and approachable and facilities were decent
Wales,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,6,8,10,"a great place to stay. the location is brilliant, just off hollywood boulevard. the place was was clean and felt very safe. the atmosphere was more like a hotel or b &amp; b than a hostel. very nice"
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great hostel, very clean and good location. kitchen a little small and could do with another table as there are only two. "
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"orange drive hostel was great! such a cool building, and a great location. i was there to see the ellen show and do a wb studio tour, which was all in burbank, not west hollywood, but it was super easy to catch a bus where i needed to go, it was about a 1/2 hour bus drive away. and it was great walking around and looking at the chinese theatre in my down-time! "
NorthernIreland,Male,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,8,4,6,8,"good location in terms of connectivity to hollywood and surrounding area (30 seconds from walk of fame). however, we arrived heavily jet lagged after long days of travelling and - when we discovered our room was adjacent to the breakfast room - asked whether there were any other rooms available (as we were keen to get some sleep and were worried the noise from the breakfast room might disrupt this).  the member of staff on the desk told us &amp;#34;you paid for budget room, what did you expect?&amp;#34;... "
England,Couple,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,4,8,"if you are looking for a very quiet hostel and primarily to eat out for every meal then this would be ok, the location is perfect for hollywood blvd and the metro and is on a quiet street. extremely small kitchen and not really any atmosphere which was disappointing, it seemed to be a much older crowd. poor wifi which nowadays is frustrating. "
USA,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"loved this hostel. it was amazingly quiet at night; i even had the windows open to let in a breeze and slept peacefully considering that we were right on hollywood. i could walk to the theater, shopping, universal studios was only 8 minutes away...etc, even santa monica was a nice drive. would definitely stay here again. "
USA,Female,41+,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,"a little dated but great location, rooms need a ceiling fan, strip outlet, no lockers"
Germany,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,very cosy hostel right next to the hollywood blvd. definitely worth a recommendation!
Australia,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was great at the hostel, check in was easy, the room was great and clean (my boyfriend and i got the private ensuite) it was very private when you want it to be, pretty quite and right near hollywood blvd and a close drive to most of the attractions. plus they offer parking which is great!"
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,6,10,8,10,this place was great! it has an amazing location. just a 3 minute walk and you&amp;#39;re right on hollywood and highland. staff were super friendly. the place was very clean and they provided free breakfast every morning! the only downside is the parking lot is very small and there was no air conditioning. 
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"facilities were dated but that added the the charm of the place. the only thing i didn&amp;#39;t love was the smell-- it wasn&amp;#39;t a bad smell, just strongly smelled of patchouli or something similar. met many friendly travelers from other countries. wish i could&amp;#39;ve stayed longer just to hang out with the people i met! stayed in the female bunk with the en suite bathroom... would definitely recommend the en suite if it&amp;#39;s available as it was nice not to have to walk down the hall. staff was very caring."
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i simply loved this place, awesome atmosphere, super clean and cozy, and well... waffles for breakfast! i didn&amp;#39;t want to leave... will come back for sure!"
NorthernIreland,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,6,8,"stayed here twice, would stay again. v good location - 2 min walk to walk of fame, 1 subway stop to universal studios/wb studios, 5 min walk to runyon canyon. street very quiet despite being so close to tourist part of hollywood. hostel very clean, staff friendly. not much of an atmosphere, common areas very small, but if you are just using it for somewhere to sleep etc then very good. if looking for somewhere a little more lively and sociable, maybe go elsewhere."
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have stayed there before and i will stay there again. the staff is always friendliy and helpful and it feels more like an home, than like  an hostel. the location is really good (close to the train, walk of fame &amp; a cvs) and quiet. it&amp;#39;s close to the freeway and they have parking. it&amp;#39;s always clean. couldn&amp;#39;t ask for more.  thank you."
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,10,"housekeeping is great, they cleaned the room each day including vacuuming and dusting the room. sheets are clean and given to you upon arrival. the hostel seems to attract a more laid-back group of people as it was very quiet. the hallway had two bathrooms and showers, both easily accessible. walking to hollywood and sunset blvd is a breeze but else where can be pricey and a lot of traffic. "
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"orange drive was more like a home stay,  the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly!  they location was central hollywood, and there was lots of information on tours and tourist destinations "

Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved it and will be back soon!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"orange hostel in hollywood is so great that i don&amp;#39;t want you to know about it! the location is just perfect -- less than a block from hollywood blvd., the red line metro station at hollywood and highland, and very close to the h&amp;#39;wood bowl and hiking in runyon canyon. the staff were so super chill cool professional. the parking is only $5 and they let us stay parked after we checked out, for no extra fee! free no nonsense wifi. clean ample bathrooms and toilets. delicious breakfast! 5 stars!"
Denmark,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect! and the lady at the reception is the best👊
China,MixedGroup,18-24,6.3,4,6,10,4,6,8,6,1) crazily poor facilities. the shower room is too tiny to turn your body around and face cleaning desk is so micro that filthy water gets everywhere. even the bed is too short for me as 1.85m length.   2) wonderful location and staff services. 
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"we were in the 6-bed female dorm for 5 nights, and we really enjoyed it! the room didn't feel crowded with 6 people and baggages. there was even a large closet, which was useful! the beds were comfortable. the room was cleaned throughout our stay. there was a bathroom conveniently next to our room, but there were more located on that floor that were easily accessible; we never had to wait long to use one. bathrooms and sinks can be a little small, but nothing we couldn't get used to."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,4,8,10,8,10,10,10,best location for hollywood sightseeing.
USA,Couple,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this hostel is quite charming. rooms are small but cozy and functional. the bed was comfy and i slept well - not noisy at night. the kitchen is small so don't plan on doing any heavy cooking, but it's clean and has everything you need for basic meals. instant coffee is a little disappointing so you may want to bring your own provisions if you are a real coffee lover.. location is very central and parking iconvenient. i had a great stay and would definitely come back again! great price too!"
USA,Female,41+,4.3,4,4,8,2,6,4,2,bathroom was dirty. hair around the shower unit. we couldn't take shower because of this. kitchen is too small. not enough tables to sit down comfortably. coffee is instant. there is no point of free breakfast.   i feel the price is too high for this service.
Australia,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,"great location, and loved the waffle iron. private bathroom was a bit small and  very basic but otherwise good :)"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the best hostel i've been to. i definitely recommend!
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,location is great. price was bearable. cleanliness was better than most. great that parking was available.
NewZealand,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"very tidy hostel. we had a private double room with ensuite. felt like more of a hotel! tastefully decorated with everything you need. location is perfect, just a few minutes walk to hollywood blvd, so made exploring the area very easy."
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,a very nice accomodation with freshly renovated rooms. for the atmosphere: i would rather describe it as a `hotel atmopsphere`. everybody is doing everything for him/herself. lacking the typically warm hostel atmosphere.
Bolivia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"one makes this place special is its location and its staff. in addition, it is located in the heart of hollywood, near all the attractions and business centers. the fact that many movie stars have stayed there as a training for their acting careers before they made it big, its fascinating. we stayed in the marilyn monroe room, spotless and cool. i recommend this place to the next visitor.

Malaysia,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"awesome hostel to stay in hollywood which is just a mere 2min walk to dolby theater, chinese theather and the walk of fame. walk slighly further down to 5mins and you reach the hollywood/highland metro station. location is excellent!    the hostel itself is a quaint slightly colonialish style, a bungalow of its own. very quiet, amazing staff pedro who is very helpful and friendly. i super loved my stay there for 5 days. will definitely stay here again if i come back to hollywood/la"
India,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,breakfast needs to be taken care of. maybe charge a few quids more but have some bread and cheese please.
England,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"the canadian guy on reception is awesome. the bathroom facilities were a bit on the small size, considering the overall size of the rest of the facilities. great comfy beds. awareness of $40 key deposit should be advised on booking. free breakfast is great, but would suggest offering toast as an addition - pancakes and waffles every morning gets a bit much! overall great stay - central location is fabulousness - some history on the house and previous guests would be a bonus too (as a thought)"
Uruguay,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,4.3,2,6,8,2,4,2,6,"the staff is not helpful at all, when we arrived we had to wait for half an hour so that they could make our check in. we had a lot of luggage and the woman who received us was not able to help with anything.   we had to leave a 40 dollar deposit, which i find completely ridiculous.  the breakfast is really poor, not real coffee, no napkins, and very little number of dishes.  the towels need to be rented, and the wifi is horrible, really slow and not even working at times.  don´t recommend it."
Germany,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful atmosphere, great location- one of my favourite hostels ever. the house is simply beautiful, makes you feel really at home. solid beds, large rooms, strong matrasses."

Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,8,10,"very well-prepared staff. we really appreciated the tips and used the transit how-to guide lots of times during our stay. it was pretty odd that the ensuite room had a toilet without a door, definitely wouldn't have paid the extra for that if we had known. the bed was quite uncomfortable and the pillows should be replaced. the location was close walking distance and very easy to get around. the waffles are a nice idea for breakfast, and there are cooking facilities."
NewZealand,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"an amazing hostel in the heart of hollywood, clean and quiet, with good security. we will definitely be back. pedro was so helpful and friendly, as were all the staff."

Canada,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this place is a calm oasis just off of full on action hollywood blvd. the contrast was remarkable for just one block back.  the location was great for buses, metro, shows, food and fun. the staff were generous with helping me find bus connections. i really enjoyed myself and met interesting people there from around the world of all age ranges.  thank you !"
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"the staff were very very good. they were pleasant, courteous, friendly, kind, and professional. they really made me feel at home.    the hostel itself is very clean and very well maintained.    plus you can't beat its location. it's literally half a block away from major tourist attraction.    will definitely recommend this place and will stay again in the future!"
England,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,6,8,normal city hostel. incredible location. very cheap private parking. friendly staff.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"lovely place to stay, amazing location right off hollywood boulevard.  also friendly staff.  not a party hostel, but good if you're an older traveller like me, as the hostel has no age restriction.  would stay again."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location super close to hollywood blvd. staff were super helpful and friendly.
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,8,4,great location!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,location location location. very close to the subway and the hollywood sights. staff were friendly and atmosphere was generally good. the free morning waffles where definitely a bonus. wifi wasn't the best and cut in an out sometimes but apart from that a great stay.
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,6,10,"great for a couple of days in la if it's your first time, right in the heart of everything &amp; only a short walk to the runyon canyon entrance if you want to hike up to see the hollywood sign. very touristy area around the corner but the actual street is very nice &amp; quiet. we had a private room with ensuite which was everything we could have asked for."
Indonesia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,everything is great
Norway,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,this hostel is ideally located!! the only minus is the free breakfast that only consists of sweet belgian waffles!! i was expecting more. bute everything else was great!!
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,6,8,10,a breakfast with bagels would be more efficient than offering the waffle dough.
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"the staff were quite cold, but the room was fantastic,  lots of character. agree with previous reviews that there needs to be fans in the rooms, we were there in fall and it was still a bit muggy. the free breakfast is fun, but there are only two waffle irons so when it's busy and you have people making three servings in a row be prepared to wait around in the tiny kitchen."
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really,  you can't go wrong with this hostel. it is excellent in all categories. a beautiful building, so close to the main hollywood strip, perfect in all the categories we marked it for. summer would be a bit hot if the room has no cooling i suspect. parking is easy too btw, we just pulled right into the back and went to check in."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, cute house, wonderful staff - melissa went above and beyond to help me both days of my stay. thank you!"
England,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"good value for money hostel in a fantastic location, right by hollywood boulevard. staff on the front desk were extremely helpful, we originally had to make 2 seperate bookings for 2 seperate rooms but once we arrived, the lady on the front desk sorted it out so we wouldn't have to switch rooms, the gentleman on the front desk gave us some great camping recommendations when we were checking out too! all in all a great experience"
Australia,Male,41+,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"as far as staff, location and price go it's a big thumbs up, the rooms are hot though and need some fans installed,,, also it quite close to the action so expect a bit of noise,,,, there was a lot of complaints about the internet service but seriously don't travel if your going to hang out and stare at your pc, there's to much to see and do and cool people to meet,,,, sitting on the net is for losers not travellers"
Hungary,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,"all you can eat self-service waffle breakfast is included! no ac in room, very very hot, otherwise nice and safe hostel in excellent location."
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very clean, comfortable, would stay there again only complaint was that it was extra hot in la that weekend and no ac in our room."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,only stayed a night but happy with the experience.
NewZealand,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"i love this place!  the staff are friendly, efficient and extremely helpful.   they make life easy when your brain is suffering from travel fatigue :)  i've had several stays there and hope to do so again."
NewZealand,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,8,10,6,6,loved the free waffles for breakfast!
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,i was very surprised this hostel did not have a good breakfast. it does not offer water either. what they do is that they put out a waffle batter and once this runs out you are out of luck.
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this place is a gem! it's cozy, well kept, clean and in a great location for our travel plans. the only thing that was frustrating was the spotty wifi on the third floor but it wasn't a big issue, we just moved downstairs if we really needed the internet.  10/10! if we're ever back in the area we know where we're staying!"
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,that's a very nice place to live in this area! soooo convince!
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"this is a very cool hostel in a great location (hollywood). it has a very &amp;#34;old hollywood&amp;#34; feel. i stayed here as a solo female traveller, and i felt very safe. the room locks, but there aren&amp;#39;t any lockers besides that, so i brought my valuables with me.  they have free breakfast, which is also nice. the only complaint i have is the noise at night. i wish i would have brought earplugs! otherwise great."
NewZealand,Female,31-40,6.9,8,6,8,6,8,6,6,i found the staff to be friendly and attentive. the room was relatively clean as were the bathroom facilities. there was no air conditioning or fan in our room so it was very hot once the sun came up. there were also ants in the room as i was leaving the window open. the shared area was small and tucked away downstairs at the back of the hostel. a bit of apity as it meant that there was no real communal feel to the place and not a lot of opportunities to meet other guests.
Australia,MixedGroup,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very clean and friendly in great location.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff people each make you feel like you are at your home with your family. the beds a very comfortable and the bathrooms are kept very clean. the front yard and side yard are great places to relax outside or do your paperwork in a warm, sunny, peaceful setting"
Philippines,Male,41+,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,"perfect location. friendly staff especially pedro.   no airconditioning, an electric fan would be useful.   poor breakfast (only waffles, should have fruits as well at least bananas).  wifi - very bad esp. in upper floor"
HongKong,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,nice hostel with excellent location. staff there are friendly and helpful
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"wifi was poor in our room (though fine everywhere else). room itself was fine, as was the ensuite bathroom. hostel could really have benefitted from a water fountain/dispenser and more breakfast options. i thought 10am is early for check-out. didn't understand the merit in having to hand over your id in order to use a hairdryer, when a deposit was sufficient for everything else."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"relaxing, well cared for, and perfect quiet location off busy hollywood strip. and free waffles in the morning! very happy with my stay."
France,Couple,25-30,6.3,4,8,8,6,6,6,6,"the room had no air-conditioning or fan which meant the windows had to stay open but it didn't cool the room at all.  also by having the windows open, there was too much noise from traffic and general outdoor noise from the central location. the bed was really hard and uncomfortable and after driving 5 1/2 hours i really needed a good night's sleep which i didn't get here. my partner actually ended up sleeping on the floor as he said it was slightly cooler being lower down as it was just too hot"
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,nice hostel in a good place. no ac. was really hot in the room. showers and room where clean. nice staff
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,wonderful hostel with wonderful staff who go above and beyond to help you out! so clean and homely! very quiet so when you go out to party you have somewhere nice and quiet to come back to. prime location of you wanna be in hollywood. i loved his hostel and i'm seriously considering checking in again during my trip! i highly recommend this place!!!!
Australia,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,the rooms were really hot and the windows weren't very secure
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"loved this hostel, close to hollywood blv, as in really close but also has a quite feel about it. met some great people here. so good i'm going back next week!"
Singapore,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,6,10,"i loved that the hostel was super clean. the rooms were very cozy and clean. there was not much interaction betweem guests at the common area and i stayed with my friends in a private room so i guess it is not a surprise too. the location is unbeatable, less than 5 minutes walk to the metro subway and only 2 mins to hollywood. there were plenty of eateries and supermarket nearby. the paper they give you at check in is also very helpful, don't be deterred by the amount of words! thanks :)"
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"place was good, although no air conditioning so can get quite hot. great location in the heart of hollywood!"
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,10,4,8,10,"great location in the center of hollywood, but at the same time very quiet. very very nice and clean rooms!   the staff was a bit slow! unfortunately we did not have air conditioning in our room."
Australia,Male,41+,6.9,8,8,8,4,6,6,8,a good location just off hollywood boulevard. lovely old house in a garden setting. book with caution in hot weather as air conditioning is not available and the rooms are stifling. you will not get any sleep. some staff are intransigent and the kitchen area is very limited.
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,this was probably the best hostel location ever and it is very clean! the staff were super cool and helpful! the only thing missing is the ac! but the parking makes up for everything 
Hungary,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was absolutely perfect while i was there. all the staff members were really friendly and helpful when we asked for advices. the hostel is really clean and the beds are comfortable. thanks for the lady at the front desk we didn't get ourselves in a really dangerous situation because she warned us about that certain area we were planning to go. we are really thankful for that. if i ever gonna have the chance to come back i definitely want to stay in this hostel again. thank you again!
Italy,Male,25-30,6.3,4,10,8,2,6,6,8,$45 per night is way too expensive for packing 6 guys in a tiny room with bare minimum amenities and also sharing 1 super tiny kitchen with all the hostel.
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have never stayed in such a beautiful, clean hostel in my whole life and i've been travelling for two years."
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,no air conditioning
England,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,6,10,8,"plugs by the bed and in the lockers, good showers, and great location. "
Italy,Female,31-40,7.4,6,10,10,6,4,6,10,"i had a good experience, although it was summer and no air conditioning and in hollywood the temperature can reach up to a 105f/40c. our room was a private one but the bathroom was tiny and not comfortable at all. pedro, the receptionist was amazingly nice, although the woman a blond one that was at nights was extremely rude and treated me in weird ways while i parked my car. the ways she used to tell things was very rude and didn't like it at all. it's not a way to treat guests. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,6,8,4,8,"this is a beautiful place. nice staff and all the things you expect in a good hostel - good location, clean sheets, a kitchen to cook, free wifi. only down sides for me as a solo traveller were 1) no atmosphere, super quiet (which is nice) but just nobody to mingle with. and 2) the rooms were really stuffy since they didn't have aircon and there's no cool breeze in la. "
England,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i've ever stayed in. perfect location including ultra cheap parking, literally right behind the chinese theatre.    this is an old lodge that used to be used by stars in the 1940s so lots of original retro waitress the phone box being one of them.  lots of space in the female dorms and excellent pancakes and waffles for breakfast.    loved this place didn't want to leave!!!"
Austria,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"loved staying here! you cannot beat the location, the building is lovely, the staff is great. being able to pop down to the kitchen in the morning to make some pancakes is a huge plus too. :)"
USA,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"pros: awesome location between the chinese theater and the magic castle (what more could you ask for?);  good private bathrooms; coffee/tea/hot water all day.  cons: no air conditioning on a hot day; wifi is weird, sometimes real slow other times fast; top bunks have no ladders so painful to climb up there.  but overall the location takes it -- i would definitely stay here again."
Germany,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,"i loved to stay in the hostel as it is clean, the beds are very comfortable, during night it is calm and a it's located at a perfect spot in hollywood to go out and discover the nightlife in l.a.   if i come back to l.a. i will definitely stay again in this hostel!"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent location
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,8,8,"i loved the character of this hostel.  plus, it was a 2 minute walk from hollywood blvd and the tcl."
Australia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,fantastic location just around the corner from chinese theatre on hollywood bve and almost next door to the tour buses.no aircon was a minus and it was noisy with traffic but earplugs fixed that. all in all great place to stay.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"this hostel is great. nice homely feel and awesome location right near hollywood blvd. breakfast of pancakes was great too. not a party hostel so harder to meet people but other than that, a good nights sleep! "
England,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,4,8,"excellent location, couldn't of asked for better.  atmosphere was very lacking, we imagined it to be a hub of livelyness being this close to hollywood with lots of young people, but we were disappointed to find that it was the opposite of this, with many older guests.  none of the provided dvds worked in the dvd player.  breakfast was the most poor out of all of the places we have stayed in the 7 weeks we have been in the states, the waffle irons were very slow and left the waffles undercooked."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,it was noce. i slept well and enjoy a lot!
USA,Female,41+,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"kitchen is small, but adequate.  waffles, pancakes and oatmeal for breakfast are included--also coffee, tea, and  hot chocolate all day.  right around the corner from grauman's chinese theater."
China,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"a very friendly and convenient place to stay, if you don't mind the noise at night from the street when sleeping, and the small ,crowded kitchen. this place could be perfect."
Croatia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,great location and chilled out atmosphere!
France,Male,41+,7.1,6,8,10,4,10,6,6,"very well located, unfortunately we had a room between a public restromm and a public shower next to a noisy kitchen with people hanging around late and speaking loud. the beds were confortable though."
China,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything is perfect!
Australia,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,excellent position to metro with a high level of cleanliness and  charm.  our room on the top level was practically new but could do with more block out curtains with windows on 3 sides that invite the lovely california sun in a little too easily. the kitchen area is somewhat small and awkward as others have mentioned but there is a lovely seating area to eat at outside in the well kept garden. the place is a credit to all the staff.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"orange drive was so close to hollywood boulevard and local shops so that was easy. the staff were friendly and helpful, the room which was apparently marilyn monroe's was comfortable and clean and i appreciated that towels were provided. the morning waffles were good too."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"nice staff, bunch of suggestions what to do in l.a.  includes breakfast but limited choice (oatmeal, pancake/waffle mix)  pratically on the walk of fame !"
Australia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had arrived a day earlier than planned knowing that orange drive had no rooms available. as the bus has drpped me at chinese theatre, i walked up to the hostel and asked to leave my excess baggage at the hostel for next day. pedro l on duty was more than helpful in accommodating me. he is also well travelled and seemed emphatetic with traveller's needs. it is such a convenient location with buses and train to all corners of la."
USA,Couple,25-30,4.6,2,2,10,8,4,4,2,"the absolute worst 2 nights of my life! we found a half dead cockroach in our room, and when asked to switch rooms we were told they were all booked. the rooms are cramped and stuffy, no a/c, and the bathrooms were so small we could barley use this sink and the shower faucet was broken! it wouldn't shut off! the beds were so hard, i woke up the next morning very sore. the only good thing about this hostel is the location, it's steps away from the walk of fame. i will never stay here again!"
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"we stayed 3 nights in the private room. the second night after 11:00 p.m, we heard loudly music and people talking from the patio. it sounded like they had a party. the location is good and the room is clean."

England,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,8,6,2,10,stayed in the private room and it was more like a hotel room. good free breakfast too - make your own waffles. perfect location right by hollywood blvd. 
Germany,Couple,25-30,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,there is no air conditioning in the rooms.  we stayed there in july and it was very hot all day long.

Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is an extremely clean, well-maintained old hollywood mansion. the location is absolutely central and convenient, but almost no street noise. i stayed in a 6-bed female dorm with bathroom, and it was very comfortable, safe and quiet. we could also access any of the numerous bathrooms in the building if our bathroom was occupied, which was very convenient. pancake/waffle batter and syrup was provided for a cook-it-yourself free breakfast. the staff was extremely courteous and helpful."
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,need stronger wifi.
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,8,10,"location is great, just a 3 minute walk from union station.  staff is really friendly and helpful, and it is very clean. wifi works well most of the time and even though the hostel is right around the corner of lively hollywood boulevard, it is very quiet and safe. it's like being in another world.   the kitchen is very small, but we didn't use it for cooking, just for breakfast, it was ok for that. the house is a bit old, furniture outdated but who cares. it's a fine place to stay, we enjoyed it"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, very clean, and very kind and helpful staff. it's amazing because literally less than a block away, you have the super noisy and crowded hollywood boulevard and hollywood walk of fame, but orange drive hostel is very nicely sheltered from that. bathrooms were very clean and the staff treated me well. one very tiny complaint i have is that breakfast options are very limited. it's pretty much just waffles and pancakes. would have appreciated maybe some fruits and toast."
Ireland,Couple,31-40,9.1,10,6,10,8,10,10,10,"great location, great service, great price!"
Poland,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,very good localization (you can't be closer to the very center of hollywood)  lockers are outside of the room which is a bit inconveniencing  friendly staff  small kitchen and terrible breakfast  it wasn't all bad and i would probably stay there again
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,8,8,10,"orange drive hostel was such a lovely place to stay . the location is the best location in hollywood , it's like a two minute walk too the hollywood boulevard so you could be out and about within an instance  , but away from the noise of the hustle and bustle so you could get a good nights sleep . breakfast faculties were good . wifi worked really well , stretched to the back of the hostel and we had the best connection out of all the hostel we stayed at . shower facilities were kept clean."
Malaysia,MixedGroup,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,excellent location!
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,6,10,"the common area is a bit stale and could use a makeover. the staff is great and the facilities are spot on. finally, the location is really great!"
Germany,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,location right next to hollywood blvd. but the street is quiet. nice building.
Scotland,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"location is excellent if you want to see hollywood and go on the tours.  also very close to runyon canyon which gives a great view of the city. staff were happy to give tips and information,  although the hostel itself was a little quiet. "
Turkey,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,6,10,location is in the very heart of hollywood. location was perfect. i stayed individual room so i can not comment  on the dorm rooms. there was no hanger in my room to hang your clothes.
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"would have loved to have some milk at breakfast, otherwise a fantastic place, i will definitely stay again!"
Australia,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,customer service was great. very helpful with all enquiries. location wise it is probebly the best spot you could ask for. more onsite showers would have been great
Switzerland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,the staff was super friendly and came outside to help find parking :)
England,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"before i arrived in los angeles i wasn't sure what to expect when staying at a hostel, but i didn't have to worry, it was a fantastic experience. it was in a great location just of the hollywood blvd, the staff were excellent and very helpful, and i met some really lovely people who i was sharing the room with.  this had been my first visit to los angeles and california, and the whole experience was something that will stay with me forever. thank you orange drive hostel    p.s wifi a bit slow."
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,6,8,10,10,10,8,10,"for a larger hostel in a super-touristy area, this hostel had a nice, relaxed vibe. the cute house makes it feel homey. bunks were wooden and not noisy. facilities were clean and modernized.  i'm really not a fan of hollywood boulevard and all its tackiness (i was staying here because i went to a concert at the hollywood bowl), but this hostel provides a good base to explore cooler areas nearby -- los feliz, east hollywood, the hills, silver lake, west hollywood, etc."
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"wicked place with great staff and coll rooms, really clean. that part of town is full of crazy people but this joint is awesome. wifi was a little sketchy but that's my only gripe."
Italy,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"i have been in many hostels all around the world and i have got to say that i liked this one very much. pretty clean, nice atmosphere and the thing about the pancakes it's true! it is so nice to make your home pancakes in the morning and also the dough was sooo good! the only negative thing was the wifi, it didn't work in the rooms and i often had to stay in the kitchen or the stairs (but that was not good either and many people were passing while i was skyping!). also, very good location!"
England,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,clean and secure hostel set in a property with history and character. great location and helpful staff as well as good value for money. recommend staying here and we will be booking again if we are back in la
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,8,8,"great location, so close to metro, buses and hollywood. good info on what public transport needed to visit different attractions, fun breakfast (make your own waffles) nice kitchen, helpful staff. matresses and pillows a little firm, and the tiny en-suite had a wobbley toilet that needs repair--but hey, we had an en-suite!"
HongKong,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"perfect location.  comfort bed.  clean room. but my room was at the basement near a stair, it's quite noisy when people going up and down."
Germany,Couple,25-30,8,8,10,10,4,8,8,8,"the location was very good, just 2 minutes to the walk of fame and the dolby theater.  the poor thing was the kitchen and the breakfast. there were only 2 cooking places, 2 waffle irons and just one sink, which is definitely not enough for a hostel in this size."
Canada,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel, very clean, great location with helpful friendly  staff."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,cool hostel. the building itself was awesome seemed like a historical building.

Brazil,Couple,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,8,8,"the location is great! two minutes from the walk of fame by walking. the staff is friendly and really helpful. there is a free breakfast (waffles). the wi-fi didn't work in my room. there is a park for 5 dollars. i stayed in a double income room and it looks like a regular hotel. my only complain is that there is no entertainment schedule, i mean, you don't meet the other travellers."
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"i was really impressed by the friendliness of the staff. pretty basic place, big old mansion with lots of halls and rooms. i really enjoyed sitting out on the nice outdoor patio because all the flowers were in bloom. i was able to walk to dinner, which was nice and convenient."
Egypt,Couple,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,"very nice room with very clean bathrooms ""which were shared in our case"", location is very near to universal studios and walking distance to the hollywood walk of fame...also very close to a lot of restaurants and shops.  the breakfast is as mentioned and it is good that they are providing it but i would suggest to add more varieties since waffles only isn't enough to be considered as a nice breakfast meal but thanks again."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"awesomene location, super friendly and informative staff that are happy to answer questions. i had a private room but shared bathroom and both were clean, comfortable and well maintained. couldn't beleive how good this place is for a hostel, great value for money, highly recommend!"

Chile,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"since my boyfriend and i arrived here we could tell that we had made the right choice. the staff at the front desk was very nice, always willing to help. the place is very big and rooms are the right size depending on what your need are. we stayed in two different rooms and they were both cleand spacious. the kitchen is very well equipped and there was always parking available for a small fee."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"this place is better than what you think of a typical ""hostel"". the service level and cleanliness is beyond expectation. also, the location is just a minute away from hollywood blvd. which i didn't know beforehand. absolutely recommended!"

Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,stayed here on two separate occasions on my recent trip to the usa and would definitely recommend it! its a well maintained old weatherboard mansion that is directly around the corner from hollywood blvd and the chinese theatre.  its pretty cool walking around the corner from all the chaos of hollywood to this house and feeling like youre in a completed secluded area. the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. the facilities are fine and the place is kept very clean.
England,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,10,8,6,"excellent location, big clean rooms"
HongKong,Female,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,excellent location for visiting hollywood!  but one of the staff is a bit wired...
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wifi was down a few days which was inconvenient. but sraff provided options so that was cool of them. great staff.
Sweden,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"pros:  close to hollywood boulevard and tcl  front door always locked  very nice and helpful staff  room was very nice  parking space around back    cons:  locks to room old and not very sturdy  small kitchen, with few places to eat    summary:  excellent place, would definitely stay there again :)"
England,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,perfect location 2 minute walk to hollywood boulevard but far enough away that you're not right on the strip. bus and metro stops really close too. staff were really friendly and helpful organising trips and transport for us as well. would definitely stay here again!
Jamaica,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the floor creeks like an old house does and with the long hallways and several floors, it kind of makes it creepy in a cool way. granted, i have an active imagination, but that's what made it exciting–imagining that i was in some sort of scary movie at night lol. anyway, it's a nice little place to stay. loved that they arranged an airport shuttle for me and were up and available at 6 a.m. to check me out. no complaints."
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really great place to stay. the staff were really friendly, loads of helpful information has been put together for guests, and the building itself and location are great. would definitely stay again. "
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,i was very impressed with this hostel. the location is awesome and within walking distance of the major attractions. the metro is a few minutes walk. the facilities were good and the host was very chatty and helpful. i would definitely stay here again if i was visiting la.
England,Female,25-30,8,10,8,10,8,8,4,8,"the hostel is a beautiful building just a stone's throw from all the action on hollywood boulevard. the room itself was very nice and spacious, my only issue being the limited number of plug sockets (although i was unfortunate with my roommates charging multiple things continuously.) the outside areas are really pleasant and there were no issues with the bathrooms. i didn't feel that there was a huge amount of atmosphere, however this again may be more to do with the mix of people i my room."
Argentina,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had the pleasure to stay in orange drive hostel where we found an excellent group of people (from the management to everyone on this). clear, clean with a great atmosphere of hapiness and service.  totally recomended !!!"
Spain,MixedGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the location couldn't be better! (a very short walking distance to the walk of fame, the dolby theatre, and the red metro line, that takes you downtown). although you have to cook your own breakfast and clean the dishes after, it's a small hostel, so we never had to wait long, and you're given the batter (for pancakes/waffles).  we booked a twin private ensuite (private bathroom) and everything looked very clean and taken care of. i'll come back!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really great location.  hollywood and all its attractions are right outside or for further trips, it's a five minute walk to the metro (shorter to bus stops).  travelers were friendly and respectful, staff was helpful, and rooms were clean.  wi-fi ranged from atrociously slow to moderately acceptable.  breakfast in the morning was the only neutral point (only instant coffee and waffle batter that didn't seem to cook right) -- but a small negative and lots of restaurants in walking distance."
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,good facilities and great staff. helped us with good local knowledge and getting the most out of our time. thanks guys!!

Canada,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great location and helpful people! bathrooms can be a bit of a squeeze. not so much a hostel to meet new people with events but overall, a great place to stay!"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel right on hollywood. staff were very helpful and informative on places to go and things to see. car parking is a real bonus at only $5 per day. would definitely return!

Australia,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was great. it was in a fantastic location, right off hollywood boulevard (literally a 30 second walk!). there was also two grocery stores close by too. reception had a whole heap of print outs on what to do in la, transport options, tours and were very friendly and helpful to assist with these. shower had great pressure and was nice and hot (and clean!). wifi was very slow in the bedroom. hostel had lovely atmosphere. free pancakes and waffles for breakfast too."

Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,10,6,8,great 1 night stay on my way to central america. desk staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. relatively easy to get to from lax. i took the flyaway to union station and metro red line to hollywood/highland for $10 total. great location and surprisingly quiet given how close it is to hollywood blvd.
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,10,8,6,8,the staff was really friendly &amp; went out of her way to help us. location was excellent &amp; the hostel created a feeling of comfort. i would definately recommend this hostel for all ages.
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,6,8,10,10,8,10,10,a hostel in hollywood at which a long list of actors and actresses once stayed -- what could be better than that?

Sweden,Couple,31-40,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,8,8,great location with parking.
Brazil,Male,31-40,7.4,6,10,10,8,6,2,10,"this hostel is in an excellent location in hollywood. but there is something that really needs to get better: the kitchen. the hostel says they offer breakfast, but besides not having nobody at least to organize the things for the customers, the kitchen is horribly tiny. so if four people are already sit having breakfast, no space is available anymore. i believe they should organize that or not to say they offer breakfast. the atmosphere of the hostel is more like a hotel, no partying at all. "
China,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,pretty good. but lack of entertainment and the kitchen is so small.
China,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"room is basic, location is great, overall recommend it "

Lithuania,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"this hostel was one of the best i have stayed at. everything was clean, the front desk receptionist was very nice, the breakfast is good. the twin room was perfect! wifi was excellent although phone sometimes turned into roaming because the room was on the lower floor."
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,thank you.
Spain,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,6,10,the location is the best.  quite 
Mexico,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"i dont know why it is rated so lowly, it is a great hostel, the rooms are comfy and location is everything, right around the corner from hollywood walk of fame, walk distance from public transportation and the breakfast is not much but it's enough, loved the waffles!"
Brazil,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,felt like i was at home. really!
Canada,Female,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,very clean and friendly.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,8,10,10,6,8,"we had a fantastic experience at orange drive. great location near public transport so it's easy to get to other places like santa monica and west hollywood. the rooms were really clean. as other reviewers have mentioned, there is more of a hotel/motel vibe here which as a couple we were fine with but if you're traveling solo, it's not really a party hostel. the front desk staff were incredibly helpful and made the experience even better."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,6,10,"we treated ourselves to a private room here when we got off the planeand the end of our trip - both times we were super tired and it was lovely to arrive here.  it is a little more expensive than a regular hostel but very nice and i felt, worth it.  keep in mind - this is not a party hostel!  but the location is awesome."
England,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the location of the hostel was excellent just a few steps and you are on hollywood boulevard. there is a supermarket and a chemist close by too. the staff were welcoming and friendly.  the shared bathroom was cleaned regularly and thoroughly.  the price was good for the location and the city.  the building was big and accommodated lots of people. only thing we didn't like it smelt a bit funny but we got used to it.  good facilities, free tea and coffee and breakfast. wifi good not great. "
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,great place. no complaints. we had a great time and would strongly recommend the place. staff is great and pedro was particularly helpful when we arrived.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i wish there was a better comment than excellent...absolutely brilliant stay. staff so accommodating and so close to hollywood boulevard. fantastic option!!!
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,great place to stay! and lovely straff!

France,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"so quiet, yet a couple of minutes away from hollywood boulevard. perfect to go and explore la and around (i did it by public transportation). the rooms are clean, and the spanish/canadian receptionist is super-friendly ! it was just a peace-ful stay !"
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,6,6,6,6,"great location in hollywood, 5 minute walk to walk of fame. day staff were nice but night staff were rude and condescending. kitchen in the morning was always too busy so we skipped the free bfast, personally i think a continental bfast wld work better. also you can hear your neighbors a lot in your room so it can be a bit noisy at night. laundry system is strange, you have to pay reception and then they show you where the washer is but there is only 1 so we had to wait to use it. "
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,this is a great and very centrally located hostel. the hollywood walk of fame is less than 5 walking minutes away. the beds are comfy and the stuff super helpful. the only thing i was not happy with was there was no hot water when you turned on the kitchen sink.
PuertoRico,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent choice, i would definitely stay here again. very clean and perfect location!!!"
Brazil,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"bed was small for a private double room. their parking costed 5 dollars per day. there was noise during the day (some carpentary), but it was ok. lovelly old woman talked to us when we were leaving. it is on the same block of walk of fame, dolby theatre, el captain and others: so it is good, will save you some time. they give waffle for breakfast, but it is diy scheme. it was taking too long for people to make theirs, so we went to a starbucks nearby. no deal-breakers. no air-con or fans."
Australia,Male,41+,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,"quiet location close to bustling hollywood boulevard.  staff are pleasant and helpfu, rooms clean but kitchen and dining space is small and cramped. but i guess everyone dines out when visiting hollywood and the nearby diners and hamburoger places are worth a visit."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,8,10,"great for exploring hollywood and nearby areas. we had a car so the location was not that important to us. the hostel itself is set in a beautiful house with a lovely, very clean kitchen with free tea and coffee. we had a private room at the top of the house, with plenty of space and a view of the front yard. as far as i could see there was no airconditioner so it might get a bit hot in summer. i'd definitely come back when in la next."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved staying here. all the staff were so helpful and friendly. would definitely recommend to anyone staying in hollywood.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,great hostel! we got a two person private room that was very charming. the bathrooms were impressively clean. the staff was always available. the hostel location is within walking distance of hollywood blvd while the street itself being pretty quiet.
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"perfect location for travelers who don't wish to drive!  you really don't need a car to explore l/a, the metro is only 10 mins walk from the hostel door. the bonus is the hollywood blvd, all the major attractions are only 2 blocks away, the suvinior stores open till 12am! you can take the hollywood sign picture on the upper level of the mall near by. i will def return to this hostel."
Scotland,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,10,4,10,"lovely hostel with amazing staff, beautiful and clean and great location but unfortunately lacking in atmosphere!"
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"location is good in regards to the metro, chinese theatre and going to see jimmy kimmel live etc however at night it can feel a little unsafe and intimidating. staff also informed us we could get a bus to the airport for $8 at the corner of hollywood and vine however failed to mention it only ran every hour so we missed it and had to get a $70 taxi to the airport which was very stressful. however staff were very friendly and helpful! "
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great place to stay. so close to all the action but felt so far away. very quiet, clean and safe. staff were very nice and helpful. definitely recommend staying here if you are a busy traveller that spends most time out and about."
Germany,Couple,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"we stayed two nights in this beautiful hostel. the building was erected in the 1920th and so everything is a little bit old fashioned but charming and clean. we loved to sit outside at the patio for breakfast (pancakes/waffles are included, also coffee/tee and cereals but no milk :/) and dinner. when you leave the hostel and turn left you already can see the hollywood blvd and the chinese theatre. the staff was always friendly and tried to help us with all our questions. we definitely recommend"
HongKong,Female,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,6,6,6,8,"the location is great, but others are so so."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect location if you're going to a show at the hollywood bowl, hiking to the griffith observatory, or hanging out on the hollywood walk of fame! we had a rental car, so the $5 daily parking behind the hostel was extremely helpful. facilities were clean and the free waffle breakfast was delicious! highly recommended."
England,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,stayed here for 6 days had a great time. people were friendly and had a nice vibe to the hostel. in a great spot so easy to wander around hollywood blvd etc. it did get really hot @ night but thats the only bad thing. and kitchens really small so didnt try and cook. but fresh and easy is close and loads of places to eat. staff where very friendly. i would stay again.  really good hostel with good tradition. thanks guys enjoyed la much more this time around. 
Taiwan,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,the room is too stuffy!! install fans of something!!
NorthernIreland,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent place and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. always go out of their way to give you more info. only complaints would be the heat as there are no aircon or even fans in the rooms which makes sleeping quite difficult. location is excellent though and everything else makes up for the lack of aircon!
Japan,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,6,10,10,10,such a lovely hostel!! location was awesome and staffs are friendly :) they have free breakfast service in the morning. you can make waffles or pancakes there..it depends but you might better go eat earlier (like 6 or 7) if you don't want to eat in a crowded kitchen. landry costs $5 everytime which might be a little bit expensive but others are awesome for me!! i would definitely love to stay here again!!
Scotland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,the room was tiny but we managed - the hostel has a nice old hollywood vibe to it - around the corner from hollywood blvd but feels more like you are in a nice quiet neighbourhood. ideal for a quick stay in la if you are there to see the main sights! 
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"a lovely place to stay. nice and peaceful in the madness of hollywood and really lovely staff. nothing fancy, so don´t come with really high expectations but it is definitely a nice place to stay in la."

Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,6,10,6,8,"a great place to stay with the best location! so easy to get around with buses and the metro right on your doorstep. staff were very friendly and willing to help you in any way they could. only negative thing i have to say about our stay was that it was so hot in our room we could barely sleep at night, even if we had the option of renting a small fan for our stay that would have been a great help! other than that, would go back in a heart beat!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really loved to stay at orange drive hostel. it was my first time being a hostel and i found the environment very friendly. loved the staff (especially laura) and all the tips that they gave to me about places to go. i've made a lot of friends there!  not to mention the free waffles in the breakfast and chocolate all day! the location is really good (1 block from hollywood blvd). my only complaint it was not having a fan in the dorms. at night was very very hot and a trouble to sleep :(
England,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, friendly efficient staff.  good location in hollywood and good facilities.  "
Wales,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is located a stone throw away from hollywood boulevard! it's clean, tidy, spacious, everything we could ever need from a hostel! there were posters and information up on the noticeboards by reception about local events and activities going on in the area and the staff were very helpful. they also give you space in the kitchen to purchase foods and drinks for yourself which is a bonus!"
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my stay was great - awesome location.

Netherlands,MixedGroup,41+,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"very gooed location  nice hotel, friendly staff  breakfast is very poor"
England,MixedGroup,25-30,4.9,6,2,8,6,4,4,4,"whilst being close to hollywood boulevard (which is less of a positive than it sounds), there is little else to recommend this accommodation.  the staff, barring one girl who looks like tina mcqueen from hollyoaks, were quite rude.  the whole place looks like it could do with a lick of paint and security leaves a lot to be desired as there is no safe room to leave luggage whilst awaiting check in.  the temperature in the room is also very difficult to regulate, leaving you sweltering."
France,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,"the place was really good to stay during our trip, close to hollywood blvd it's perfect to feel the atmosphere of the walk of fame.  however one of the receptionist was not welcoming and we felt as we were disturbing her. we payed to be here, just remember that ! the other ones were nice.  i particularly enjoyed the front and the private garden to spend time with people."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,10,8,8,6,8,was in an excellent location
China,Female,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,beautiful girl checking in，they help us buy the ticket to universal studio ，and book taxi。feel very good！exceeding explanation！
SouthKorea,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it would be much better if the kitchen had more space.
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,perfect location if you want to do hollywood´s tourist parts.  good rooms but thin walls so if you are sensitive to sounds this can be a problem.  nice and service minded staff. would definitely recommend this hotell.
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant hostel!! the location is amazing-can't believe how close you are to the walk of fame!! check in was very easy and the room we stayed in (private twin with shared bathroom) had everything you needed and was very good for the price. rooms were clean, staff were very friendly and beds were comfy and there wasn't a lot of noise.it was easy to arrange a shuttle to the airport  and it was only about $17 so a lot cheaper than a taxi. i would definitely come here again!!"
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,orange drive hostel was amazing! the staff were very nice and informative about the hostel and things to do in the area. this was my first hostel in america and i can't imagine having a better experience. hostel is completely safe and in a great location!
Thailand,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,i don't know how to use the air condition .（＾_＾）
Switzerland,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i wasn't in this hotel this year, but last year."
Canada,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i am ok without milk for breakfast, but if there were some instruction of pancake maker, that would be great"
Austria,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"very very impressed! nice rooms, good and helpfull staff!!"
Canada,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"i had a private room with no bathroom, but was allowed to use any bathroom in the building, and there were plenty.  the room was hot because there was no air conditioning.  the place was clean and the location can't be beat - from the front door we could hear the screaming fans when the rock showed up at the chinese theatre for a premiere."
England,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,a/c would have been nice during the summer
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"no complaints. clean, neat, close to everything. will definitely come back again."
Mexico,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is great to stay close by the hollywood blvd (just around the corner). you are in the middle of all the action but great to go back and rest in a quiet, peacefull place. breakfast is great, all you can eat waffles, tea, and coffee. the staff is super nice and helpfull, they hook you up with great tours, give you tips and directions to move around the city, and have a great shuttle service to lax. overall not your tipical hostal experience because this one just went overboard. "
USA,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the location is awesome. close to the metro, la fitness, cvs, and other stores/restaurants. big beds, but no a/c or fans.  i just didn't like that i had to give them $20.00 as collateral for the key just because it forces you to use the atm there. everything else was good."
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"excellent location, particularly if you don't have a car. lots of attractions within walking distance. the 6-bed dorm i stayed in was comfortable enough, but very hot (no air con) and there were only 3 power outlets in the room. bathrooms were generally very clean and there were plenty of them. staff seemed friendly. wifi was a bit temperamental, particularly in the lobby. breakfast is basic and the kitchen is way too small. other guests were quiet - no parties here, thank god. good overall."
Uruguay,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly attention, great location -less than a block away from the chinese theatre-, very cozy facilities. definitively the place to stay in hollywood!"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay - the location is perfect, literally minutes from hollywood boulevard, it doesn't feel like a standard hostel the house is so beautiful it feels part of history.  the only downside is there is no air con, but with the windows open it was fine and everything else made up for that!"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,6,10,6,8,"we stayed at orange hostel for 2 nights earlier this month. the property was lovely, however because of the age of the property, there was no air-conditioning so rooms got quite stuffy at night. the dorm was rather expensive for what it was. however, we loved the staff. they were extremely lovely and accommodating. our stand out favourites were laura, tattooed guy, and particularly pedro."
England,Couple,18-24,7.1,8,10,10,6,4,4,8,"good points: - amazing location for the walk of fame and chinese theatre  - lots of bathrooms - free breakfast  bad points: - no tv in the room which we did have in other hostels (in a private room) - no pool - tiny bedroom  - not overly sociable environment  - kitchen is small for the size of the hostel - no air con , the rooms get ridiculously hot and there isn't even a fan  -room wasn't cleaned all week so bin overflowed - couple of the staff really strange and pretty rude  "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"we only stayed here for one night when we arrived in the us but this hostel is perfect. it's in a small little old house which you wouldn't expect so close to hollywood boulevard and it was brilliant for what we were after. nice facilitiesn and rooms, good wi-fi, and a great location."
Bahrain,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,10,4,8,"best thing about the hostel was the location, located right in the centre of hollywood and a few minutes walk from the station. staff was friendly and welcoming - only down side was the atmosphere. not sure if it was just the people that were in my room at the time, but no one made an effort to socailise and as a solo traveller i'd have been better off elsewhere."
Germany,Couple,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,4,4,6,8,breakfast was poor. only waffles and instant coffee.  rooms little bit smelly...
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,amazing location!!!
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"one thing i wish was on the webpage was that there is a $20 refundable security deposit, payable in cash upon arrival.  that information would be helpful to travelers who want to make sure they have enough cash on them for other activities.  having said that, the location was excellent, the facilities were great (though one wishes for air conditioning in summertime, especially when sleeping on a top bunk), and the staff were very helpful.  plus, you can't beat free breakfast!"
Germany,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great hostel, clean, perfect location, nice staff"
China,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,a little noisy. may be the window can be doubled to keep quiet.
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,4,8,8,"loved the location and how easy it was to get in and out at night. they provided information about local happenings and transportation. kind of surprised they left out uber and lyft. i felt very safe there and the room was clean. it felt really awkward talking to the person at the from desk, who didn't make much eye contact or smile. they were by no means rude, but i didn't receive the level of hospitality i was expecting."
England,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"awesome hostel! we were in a private double, next to one of many shower/bathrooms so appreciated the quieter atmosphere (more hotel than party hostel). considering location, which is spot on for hollywood, and solid wifi, the included waffle breakfasts are super good value for la (and us in general) although the kitchen  is small and queues can form on busy mornings. considering the price of accommodation in americas larger cities i would say this was excellent value overall and great staff. "
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"myself and my girlfriend staye here for a week. staff were extremely friendly, the location is fantastic - right next to the hollywood walk of fame and near the metro. room was lovely made and very value for money. if you are going to la you have to stay here, it really was great! "
USA,Female,41+,8,6,8,10,8,8,6,10,"this hostel is located in a lovely, rambling old hollywood-style house and has a nice lawn with outdoor seating and a patio for breakfast.  the upper floors with private rooms were very quiet - not the place to stay if you want to make some noise, come in late, stay up visiting, etc.  definitely not a party atmosphere.  free pancake breakfast was offered (did not try it).  nice perk was the parking for 5$ extra; you'll need it in this neighborhood.   great location."
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i thought the location was perfect as it was so close to the tours i booked and easy to get to all the places i wanted to go.
England,Female,41+,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"good - staff were helpful,  useful location for my needs, clean spacious room.  not so great - 3 out of 4 nights i was woken up around 1pm by people sitting outside in the smoking area being unnecessarily noisy.    i thought the bathroom on the top floor somewhat inadequate for a shared facility."
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,10,8,10,4,8,6,10,the kitchen is very small and there was someone who was helping people make breakfast but it wasn't clear if she worked there or was simply being helpful. the hostel was in a great location. the manager interrupted us checking in to talk to the employee simply so she could leave. if would have been nice if she could have waited until we were checked in.
Canada,Couple,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"good, helpful staff, fairly clean, good amenities. a bit expensive, but it's hollywood, and the location is great. we had a private room, but it was very noisy, as the walls/floors are paper thin (it's an old building), and right next to common washroom."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,location is incredible and staff are so helpful - will go out of their way for you.    highly recommend this hostel. after a big day of being a tourist in hollywood its a perfect hostel to come home to!
Brazil,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything is perfect!!! wonderful place!!!! thank you!!!!
Germany,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the location is perfect to discover la and hollywood. it is a quite and clean hostel, very close to the hollywood boulevard and the walk of fame. staff is friendly and helpful."
England,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,very convenient location right behind the hollywood and highland center. great for tourists. the rooms are big and clean and facilities are good. the only -ve was that it gets a bit noisy in the night especially at weekends. i would still recommend this hostel to anyone who visits la and wants to stay at hollywood
Norway,Male,31-40,7.7,4,8,10,8,8,6,10,"most of the bathrooms didn't worked when i stayed there  (after doing booking now with hostelworld  over 150 times this is the first time the price chance while i was booking around 32 dollars  be over 40 dollars a night.) definite not wort the extra price, fore that price i could get a privet single room some where else.  or 23 dollars for just a good hostel.  perfect for people whose not there to party or meet people (other guests), quiet there,  good standard on rooms, and really good location."
England,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"good location in hollywood close to hollywood boulevard, making it possible to travel e.g. downtown on metro, but also to get buses to west hollywood.  all good except for 'breakfast', which was actually just waffles - not even any fresh milk."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.3,10,10,8,8,8,4,10,"beds are comfortable and the house has several bathrooms, but there is no common area inside (apart from the reception room), which is very bad if the weather is too hot and dry like when we were there. breakfast is almost nonexistent. the hostel resembles a guesthouse and lacks atmosphere a bit. it also has some strict rules like a $50 cash-only security deposit and an inflexible 10 am check out. location is around the corner from hollywood bl., thus well-served by public transportation."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"nice hostel. great location, limited parking however but you should manage to get a park , especially if you have a smaller vehicle. friendly staff. dorms fairly private. overall a nice place in a good location."
USA,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thank you for a great stay! meeting the owner was a joy!

England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,10,6,8,8,"really good location, nice looking hostel. lots of bathrooms, small kitchen and washing machines available.   our room was bright and clean, all the windows had fly nets so you could leave the windows open.   the only downside was that the room got so hot because there was no air con or fans."

Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"there is nothing more i can add or suggest. orange grove really is an excellent place to stay , ( my second visit now ) . all the way from australia, i wouldnt consider anywhere else. my 15yr old grandaughter, i traveled with on this visit, wants to return to orange drive hostel. she felt safe and welcome. a home away from home. thankyou"
Australia,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"the staff were very helpful, having only just arrived in la from australia, this was the first place we went to.  only one blocks walk from walk of fame and catching buses around la.  impressed."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,6,10,"the location is perfect for hollywood literally a stones throw from the main street in hollywood but you can't hear any noise at night so you can get a good nights sleep!super clean and nice big airy rooms with comfy beds. nice outside area and tv room. free breakfast of pancake or waffles in the morning is appreciated and the staff are very friendly. free, fast wifi. i would say it is slightly overpriced though."
England,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, clean rooms with lovely decor, free wifi that worked well. not enough bathrooms it would appear, breakfast was a bit naff plus the kitchen was a little small. doors slamming in the night but otherwise quiet."
Sweden,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"we are a young couple who stayed here in the beginning of april. we liked the hostel and the staff, some of them more and less. the location was really good, two minutes walk to hollywood boulevard and the walk of fame. there are a lots of restaurangs close by. it was also just a short drive to both universal studios and six flags. "
Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the location is excellent, the staff was very friendly (thanks for the great restaurant suggestion!!), the waffles for breakfast were nice, the atmosphere is really relaxing. i would totally recommend this place!"
Argentina,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,breakfast says it includes creamer. we stayed for 2 nights and we never saw the creamer.  kitchen is to small and always a mess.
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,great hostel we have changed our accommodation so we can stay here again when we're back in la tomorrow night
Finland,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,the location of this hostel is absolutely perfect! hollywood blvd really is just around the corner and there's an excellent access to public transportation so it's easy get around and go wherever you like to: metro station and bus stops are just a few-minute walk from the hostel what really made my trip. thanks for all the maps and additional information/tips about la. they were very helpful! staff was awesome and very helpful!
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i love the old hollywood feel to the place so much, and how there are the old phones and furniture still in the place.  excellent location for visiting hollywood, a couple blocks from the train (which you can take all the way from the airport), very clean inside, and felt so homey.  loved it.  it's a lot of money for a hostel, but apparently not for one in hollywood, and i'm so glad we chose it."
Germany,Couple,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,a wonderful place to stay we will happily come back.
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,8,10,8,6,8,the only diadvantage is the wifi connection a bit on the slow side. but overral the hostel was nice and quiet!

USA,Female,31-40,6.6,8,8,8,4,8,6,4,the facility is in desparate need of cleaning. a little paint and elbow grease would drastically improve its overall appearances. 
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"i have a huge pet peeve with the lack of outlets in the room!  one outlet on each side of the room.  the outlet on my side was below the bottom bunk bed, which i could not get access to.  the other outlet was occupied by the women on the other side of the room.  that left me going downstairs to the basement, even late in the evening in my pajamas, to charge my phone.  quite a ridiculous measure to have to take."
NewZealand,Female,41+,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"have no negative comments about this hostel but just a word with those who get to use the shuttle service ensure you have a firm agreement with them as i got told by hostel and lady at shuttle point the$$$  amount, but driver charged more when he dropped me off even though i argued the point--going back to la airport no hassle thank you to staff for all your help and yummy free breakfast--best wishes"
Panama,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"excellent location if you want to be close to walk of fame, dolby teather, chinese teather in fact beside hollywood boulevard were all the cool stuff and bars are.   in reception has a lot of documents that will help you with directions and number of buses that need to take to go to santa monica beach or venice beach and other beautiful places.    nice staff very helpful - perfect hostal to relax not to party or drink - clean - wifi - do not have lockers for backpacks or any suitcase."
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"free parking, one block from the tlc chinese theater on hollywood boulevard, and a variety of public transportation options - it is the ideal location to stay. it's located in a side street off of hollywood boulevard that's actually very quiet and nice. i would definitely stay here again."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i liked the neighborhood feeling i got even though you are right by hollywood blvd. you might get a little turned around while walking thru the house, but it just added to the charm. there's parking behind the hostel for $5 (not sure if this was per night). i really liked the place "
Netherlands,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"we absolutely loved staying at the orange drive hostel! so close to hollywood boulevard, but still nice and quiet. bed was a bit shaky, some rough edges here and there but hey, it's a hostel! at an amazing location! atmosphere was great. nice and relaxed. were also very grateful for the parking permit option. the house is amazing. would definitely recommend it and would definitely stay there again!"

England,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"enjoyed my stay here. lovely old building, very spacious rooms, shared with five other girls who were lovely and very friendly. very close to hollywood where there is loads to do. hostel provided free coffee and pancakes each morning, lockers and laundry facilities. recommended."
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"location couldn't be better. the hostel is clean, decent, friendly and helpful. at times, the wifi wouldn't go all the way to the rooms, so we would need to awkwardly sit at the reception to look at emails, so there wasn't any privacy really when going online."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"really great value for money place to stay close to hollywood boulevard, clean and comfy. if you're looking to check out the hollywood strip, this place comes highly recommended."

Cambodia,Male,18-24,3.4,2,4,8,4,2,2,2,"the staff arguing with you about not refunding your money even though you have given her 24hr advance notice. the excuse was she could not find someone else to take my place on time, so that became my problem. that was the stupidest thing ever anyone has said to me."
China,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location is great, and the staffs are very nice!"
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,very nice old house converted to a hostel. just 5 minutes walk to hollywood blvd and a fresh n easy super market great location. front desk staff are very helpful and hostel is very clean. only draw back seemed to be a bit limited in atmosphere and socially a bit quiet otherwise highly recommended!
Iraq,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i think this hostel is pretty good. it just needs to add some activities like small parties. otherwise, i loved my stay there."
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,6,10,"the location was good but you still have to take subways and buses just because la is a big city. the hostel is right in the middle of hollywood, so it is quite safe and lively. you have access to good restaurants and shops. the hostel itself was good, too. there are many restrooms so you don't have to wait at all. rooms are kept tidy and clean. however, if you are looking for some kind of ""friendly"" atmosphere, orange manor might not be a good option cause it is more of a hotel than hostel."
China,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,6,10,8,10,the location is perfect. it is close to hollywood. but wifi there is sloww.....
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,6,10,"lovely hostel in a great location. if you want to see everything hollywood, this is the place for you. they offer $5 car parking too if you want to see more of la which was good. staff were keen to help and all facilities were very clean and good. free breakfasts were offered and rooms were of a decent size. only criticism was that it felt a bit more like a b&amp;b than a hostel, but that isn't all bad when you're tired and just want to sleep."
England,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"nice, clean place to stay with comfy beds and lots of room. the free breakfast was great and was useful to have a kitchen but cooking options are limited. the staff were very friendly and helpful and it's super close to prime locations in west hollywood. only downside was the wifi being hit "
France,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"just a perfect hostel! i was traveling by myself i felt really safe and i had a rental car i just paid 5$ for 24h parking, just behind the hostel. you walk 3min and you are on the first star on the walk of fame so perfect location, i woke up one morning and walk 5min and just saw ben stiller, amazing! staff are really nice they helped me to book a show. you have lot of space in the room and the hostel is in fact a big house with lots of history. "
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel in an excellent location. we stayed in a private room which was very comfortable and in close proximity to the shared bathrooms, which were always very clean. wifi was free and fast. the best thing about the hostel was the location. it was only a few minutes walk to the walk of fame, and close to bus stops and the hollywood highland metro stop. would definitely recommend this hostel.

Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is very near hollywood boulevard and all the main attractions in this area, bus stop and metro station as well. breakfast is only pancake (not so good though)"

Ireland,Couple,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location and really clean hostel. room was clean and big. only down side there is no kettle so you have to boil water for tea or coffee!
Denmark,Female,41+,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"nice, clean and close to everthing.. frindly staff, the only complaint was the breakfast."
Brazil,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"a coll place, with paking in holiwood"
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,the kitchen/ lounge area is very small but as there were very few people staying at the time it was not a problem for us.  very close to metro and has parking on site at he hostel so great for all travels!   we also got given a 6 bed airy room for just the two of us as they were so empty she said she would give us that one on check in rather than in the basement :) 
Switzerland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thank you guys for making my start in l.a. so easy and wonderful!
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this place was in the perfet location. hike at runyon canon is within walking distance and a must see (especially after dark). it felt like we had a home to come back to staying here. super market close by was perfect to be able to walk to and get food and snacks. the only thing that would make this better is having a fridge in the room , but there were fridges downstairs in the hangout area that everyone can share..didn't really want to keep my stuff in there. i will stay here again for sure!"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,amazing location. literally around the corner from dolby theatre and chinese theatre courtyard.
Malaysia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,6,10,10,"nice place too stay. good dining place and good kitchen. its locate near to a grocery shop name 'fresh and easy' that you can buy ready to cook food for your dinner, it's much more cheaper than dining outside. waiting for the staff who is probably on the phone with her boss for 25 minutes to call my super shuttle to airport which is already late, didn't feel that they put customer first. overall it's still a great place."
HongKong,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,the kitchen is too small &amp; the common area is not big enough for meal (just one table for the whole hostel)
Panama,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location. very friendly staff. the check out is to early, but that's it.. i highly recommend it."
England,Couple,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"this hostel was perfect for a short stay in la. perfect location, clean rooms, helpful staff. i have very few complaints about this place, although ac in the room would have been good as it was very hot. also, i did not appreciate the australian guy who went around knocking on everyone's door trying to pressure people into joining the guided pub crawl one evening."
England,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"good hostel. nice patio areas and everything was clean. on hollywood's doorstep, but quite place still. not much socialising but there's often one or two people around to chat to. staff were either great or terrible, just depends who's on the shift. lockers weren't in the rooms and kinda small, big enough for a 13"" laptop. toilets/ showers were too few, but they were very clean. breakfast was poor, but grocery store 2 minutes walk away. they do a $20 refundable deposit for the key, so take cash."
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"the wifi was a bit shakey and the breakfast was a bit unclear was were included and what was private. small kitchen. the location great, parking, great patios, clean bathrooms and toilets. overall great"
Ireland,Female,25-30,8,10,10,10,4,6,6,10,location is great. it's a beautiful old manor house just around the corner from hollywood blvd. only downsides are there is no air conditioning in the rooms and it is in la so it gets pretty hot! also the reception staff were unapproachable sometimes. as they seem to live there too and at times had their friends hanging out in the reception area for hours and made it feel like you were disturbing them if you came to ask a question. they were nice otherwise. would stay again.
Brazil,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"great location in hollywood, very close to the walk of fame, m. tussauds, chinese theatre, etc in a lovely house.    staff was friendly and nice, jacques who checked us in was lovely and we managed to sort out an issue right away (we overpaid for parking but got the money back). oh yes, there is a $5 dollar a day fee for parking and laundry for $5.the bedroom could've been cleaner, there were doritos pieces on the floor next to the bed (private room). don't count on their wi-fi, it does't work."
England,Female,41+,7.1,8,4,10,4,10,8,6,"the main issue was the lack of air conditioning in the room, which seemed to be one of the hottest rooms in the building. having a washing machine that worked well was an advantage.  the other problem we experienced was that someone stole a large bag with several packets of candies/sweets from the communal fridge, which we had been intending to take home as presents. we were a bit disappointed about that due to the cost and no time to replace them."
Lithuania,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,8,6,"awesome location, friendly staff, super cheap! perfect if you are looking for a cheap place to crash."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,underrated hostel. excellent location and friendly staff!
Australia,Male,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,6,8,8,4,i gotten eaten to bits by bed bugs. clean sheets were provided but i still got eaten. other than that good place to stay 
Australia,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"excellent little hostel. amazing location - so close to where it's all happening in hollywood and yet so quiet. the rooms were beautiful for hostel rooms with 2 beds rather than bunks in the private rooms. was not a very social hostel, at least not while i was there, but lovely nonetheless and perfect for our purposes."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"liked the location and the hostel, wifi dropped out constantly though"
Taiwan,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,10,8,6,the location is perfect! however they don't provide towels for free and there was a piece of trash under my bed when i checked in. staff is really nice and the free wifi is fast
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"rooms were spacious and comfy  staff was very friendly,  welcoming and helpful  location is superb"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,really enjoyed my stay here. right in the heart of hollywood! met some great people and the place was really good overall. a very old house but well looked after and had good facilities and layout. will definitely stay here again. thanks team!

Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,6,8,8,"great experience, easy to find, really good location. worth while - staff we're pretty chill. not many people about but that's probably due to the day i was there"
England,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome location, just behind chinese theatre. staff friendly, comfortable rooms and facilities and car park was a bonus."

Taiwan,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,6,8,8,8,"this hostel is pretty clean. the location is great for people who needs the public transport. staff are nice. oatmeal is provided for breakfast, you can cook for yourself. however, there seemed no air conditioner in my room. so it would be a little hot in the room at daytime."
Bangladesh,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean hostel. staffs were friendly. adequate number of showers and toilets were available. most importantly, location was excellent!"
Norway,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,8,6,"the location was perfect,straight up from hollywood boulevard.i did not get any notise in advance that the price had got up,so i had to pay ekstra on arrival.this did not give a god first impression.for that price you should be able to rent a towel for free,instead of having to pay 2 dollars,like now,and maybe get some milk for the cereal offered for breakfast.but i did love the atmosphere of the house.staff was friendly to.i would come again.miss la allready!"
France,Couple,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,you must stay here. best value.
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,very close to hollywood blvd. nice place to stay. poor breakfast.
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.6,8,10,10,6,4,4,4,"best location ever! ants in the kitchen, bad attitude by the staff, and 5$ for washer drier?!? and there's only one machine so prepare to wait if laundering is needed. aside from that the rooms are big, clean and the location seriously can't be beat! "
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,"the hostel was nice. the location is right on the hollywood blvd corner, in the center of action. the place has $5 all day parking in the back yard. the staff was really nice. we had a private two bed room, however it was noisy due to the managers dog barking and people talking in the back yard, the front desk staff gladly switched us to the more quiter room on the second floor. the hostel over all is great, and highly recommend it!"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was a great hostel, the location was fantastic and close to the sights without feeling like you were in them.  i was impressed with how clean and friendly everyone was."
Australia,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,awesome! can't beat the location. lots of character. my second time here and i'd go back again!
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,the room above ours had water leaking into our room. was quickly attended by the staff on duty at the time.
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"stayed at the orange drive for 7 nights with my friend. we were looking for someplace cheap to spend our nights and this hostel was an excellent choice! great, friendly, helpful staff. clean rooms, however small and without any closet space..i would definitely consider staying here again. worth every penny. as we didn't have a car, this location was perfect with the metro near and everything!. bottom line, you get what you pay for. if you don't have too high expectations, you will be pleased!!"
England,MixedGroup,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really loved our stay here you could not get closer to everything you would want to see in this area. we had a room on the 3 rd floor which was really good. i would stay here again &amp; again if i return to l.a. anytime..
Hungary,Male,31-40,3.7,2,6,8,2,2,2,4,"no free breakfast!!! only oatmeal, but nothing else. two bottles of cornflakes, no milk, no orange drink, nothing but hot water.  the staff wasn't helpfull, they were rude.  the room has terrible bathroom, old and dirty!  no any signs on the streetfront, very hard to find this place.  the location is good if you interested the hollywood area.  i was a lot of places around the world [hong kong, singapore, new york, san francisco, mallorca, tokyo, etc.] but this hostel was the worst ever!"
SouthAfrica,Male,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,10,8,6,8,"this hostel is right in heart of everything you want to do in hollywood and nearby. quiet, which we liked. "
Germany,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,6,8,8,8,"we had a very big room, hostel was clean but bathroom facilities are rare. we often had to wait for using the showers. staff was friendly but we wished to get more information about the area. "
Philippines,Female,41+,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,6,6,the restroom near my room is under construction during my stay.  i need to find other restrooms.  there should be an available potable water to drink.
Canada,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,4,8,8,8,6,"normally in other hostels, they clean the sheets everyday, here, you have to change your own sheets and can't do that every day! no lockers nearby, there were some in the basement and was not useful. location in hollywood &amp; orange is pretty sketchy and gets worse as you go east. felt very uncomfortable to leave my stuff there. staff at this hostel were very nice tho, no complains there."
SaudiArabia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8,10,6,10,6,10,6,8,"a beautiful old building, with lots of bathrooms everywhere   rooms are clean and big enough"
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,6,4,6,"most of the staff were rude.  the shower didn't drain and filled the shower floor with nasty soapy water before i had even rinsed my hair out.  some reviews have said there is free parking.  not the case, it is $5/day with a tiny parking lot.  best i can say- the sheets were comfy (but the beds were old, creaky and hard).  no ac-very hot!"
Peru,Male,31-40,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i was not pleased that i was charged an extra $20 upfront which was not mentioned on the website.  overall, i cannot complain as the total cost of staying there for the weekend was pretty decent.  the other reservation was that i was charged for sunday night, when i was not planning to stay until sunday afternoon.  otherwise, i was fortunate to find decent roommates who were respectful of my belongings.  it took a bit long to wait for the men's shower so i had to use the one upstairs."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,6,8,"nice small hostel set in a big old house just off of hollywood boulevard. tiny little bathrooms that were generally kept clean and tidy, though the showers were a bit dim and cramped. old furniture and rugs generally added positively to the character, though could have been cleaner. free wifi worked in most parts of the building. staff generally helpful."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place. the staff were very kind helpful ladies and the room was clean. not a single problem! right next to hollywood! i enjoyed my stay there plus free parking
Australia,Couple,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,8,6,"good, convenient hotel that's a bit different. no problems at all. "

Italy,Couple,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,"the hostel has a very nice atmosphere, it´s like staying at your grandma´s. the rooms are nice, but the shared bathroom is very small. anyway the location right next to the dolby theatre and hollywood boulevard is great. i would totally recommend this hostel to my friends."
England,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, lovely building - we enjoyed our stay!"
Australia,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,10,6,8,8,10,"perfect location, very clean and staff friendly and helpful.  would recommend spending  a little extra to have private bathroom."

Germany,Couple,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"very nice hostel close to the hollywood boulevard. we stayed here twice and enjoyed both our stays. even though it's really close to the main tourist area, it's relatively quiet. the rooms were spacious and clean. staff was very friendly and the free internet worked great. only thing we found a bit weird was that you had to pay 2$ to rent a towel."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great little place, clean, comfortable and great value for its hollywood location. staff were very pleasant and helpful, and happily accommodated our early check in when we were badly jetlagged."
England,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,6,10,10,10,"i really liked the hostel it had a calm but good atmosphere, things felt not to loud but company was never far away, with some great people staying as well as the staff who were all really good and i liked them all.     some of the facilities like lack of laundry was not so good, and the internet was also not good even though there in a pay in machine. my email accounts didn' work properly on it. however these things were not every thing and the location was good and over all would give it 9/10"
China,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"excellent location! just a block from kodak theater, walk of fame! friendly staff ! the nice lady in the front desk lead us up and down stairs to let us choose the room and introduce the history of this lovely inn. i just found out this lovely hostel has once provided as a lovely home to some famous actors and actress like marilyn monroe! and the room is quite clean and comfortable. the only problem is the heater. it is quite old that it seems it couldn't change temperature and had a bit smell."
Australia,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"no power point in the bathroom, and 4 beds, yet only 1 towel hook."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,8,10,excellent location and helpful staff - they were very accommodating with my requests for dropping off my key for check-out early.  parking is also available onsite for only $5!
Croatia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,great location and great staff!
England,Couple,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, 2 minutes walk from hollywood boulevard but set back enough to avoid the noise. very good kitchen facilities, but tended to get our own breakfast from the supermarket that was less than 5 minutes walk away. everybody was very friendly, good hostel for meeting people and getting advice about the area. our room had no plugs but there were plenty in the common room and other rooms had them. overall, a good hostel, in fact we are returning on our way back through l.a!"
Chile,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"amazing location (less than a block away from the walk of fame, 2 blocks from a metro station), really quiet hostel, very nice and helpful staff. i would stay there again"
Ireland,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"orange drive manor hostel is in an excellent location in hollywood ,just off hollywood blvd,close by santa monica and sunset strip and universal studios and all hollywood sights,plus subway close by!....very friendly and helpful staff.....bathrooms,showers.and rooms very clean ,excellent!good value for money...enjoyed my stay there...i will come again when in hollywood,la!"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,4,8,"very friendly staff and top location. however the hostel lacks a convenient space for socialising and hence i found it difficult to meet people. though my fee was waived by kevin, a great gesture, charging for towel and internet use puts the hostel on the backfoot immediately. including the fee for all would appear better in my opinion. similarly, in not making the bed for visitors the hostel is a step behind the competition - minor but noticeable. despite this, had a top time."
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"the staff was really nice and gentle. the location was excellent, 1 minute walk from the chinese theater."
Poland,Couple,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,6,10,"it's more of a hotel than a hostel but not necessarily in a good way. there was no real common area. kitchen was tiny and breakfast was oats and hot water. there was no luggage storage, we had to leave our bags at the reception. the general feeling seemed unwelcoming mainly because of the rules posted everywhere on the walls like no using facilities after the check out and charging extra for late check out (even 5 minutes). on the upside staff were very friendly and helpful."
Australia,Female,18-24,6,8,6,8,4,6,4,6,"nice enough, little old and could do with a face lift."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, helpful staff and clean bathrooms."

Australia,Couple,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,6,10,"superb location, friendly and helpfull staff. great rooms. very few opportunities to socialise with other people staying."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was only 1 block from hollywood blvd. and only 2 blocks from the metro station. i found getting around hollywood, as well as greater los angeles and the beach very convenient. the staff was fantastic and helped me plan my daily adventures. all i had to do was ask. i felt welcome and safe, and the rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean for the price. the location is a little off the beaten path, so don't expect a ton of people, but i had no troubl running in to people."

France,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great place with character , very helpfull staff and fantastic location! only downside to the stay; very small bathrooms/toilets! but that's nothing they can really change i think, it's an old building. alltogether, great place!"
France,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"regarding what one expects from a hostel in la, this is one where you can definitely stay, given its location, the seriousness of the staff, etc....  the one less good point i felt is the non existence of breakfast in the morning and may be the lack of activities inside the manor itself."
Netherlands,Male,41+,7.1,6,8,10,8,6,4,8,"it's a bit of a mix between an hotel and a hostel. it has more character than your average hostel, but it was not that much fun when i was there. but the location is excellent!"
England,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,4,6,6,8,"location is alright if you want to do hollywood boulevard. didn't strike me as a place where it promoted meeting other people, although i may have been there during a quiet period. no laundry facilities. i thought it was a bit pricey considering what the place was like. staff were friendly and helpful."
Australia,Female,31-40,5.7,4,6,10,4,8,4,4,"great location. did not feel secure, dirty and linen was dodgy."
Singapore,Male,31-40,7.1,8,4,10,4,10,6,8,"location is fabulous. just within walking distance from the chinese theater. very quiet at night. away from the vibrant hollywood. good if u need a good rest. the staffs were friendly &amp; hospitable esp one of the ladies, sorry i didn't get her name. she helped me a lot, e.g. where to go, and more importantly how to go by the cheapest way. really very thankful to her.   please take good care of your own belongings &amp; valuables. you only have your own self to blame if u lose anything esp in dorms."

USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"loved the location and the beautiful old building (especially the telephone booth). however, the hostel needs better options for securely storing stuff, please. there are only a few working lockers &amp; they are tiny.  they also require money every time you open &amp; close them, instead of having a daily rate. not at all helpful. also, the area in which luggage is stored pre &amp; post checkout is not secure. staff is frequently out of the room for very long periods of time &amp; all guests have access."
China,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,very very good especially the location
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,8,4,4,helpful staff and great location!  however very noisy room and no air con in room which is ridculous given its so warm at night-worst nights sleep in a hostel!
Finland,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"nice place in a great area. really close to go walk on to the hollywood hills! free oatmeal for breakfest, lots of room. no ac but it will save the earth so thats ok."
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"a really nice hostel. it is in a great location, just a very short walk to hollywood boulevard.   the staff were really lovely, and helpful with tips on places to eat, and how to get around la.  we stayed in a private room, that was huge, with lots of wardrobe space and drawers. the bathrooms were tiny, but the showers worked fine.  only downside was that it was really hot in la, and there was very little air in the bedrooms (no ac / fans)."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed in a 4 bed female dorm and although there wasnt that much space, it was was clean and tidy and i would def stay there again. i liked the location - 2 seconds to the train station and near lots of buses.  staff were very friendly and helpful."
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel with friendly, attentive, caring staff and a location that can't be beat! i'm so glad i stayed here, and next time i'm in l.a. i will definitely be back. the only reason i only marked ""good"" on the facilities column is that the air conditioning was broken in our room, and in the middle of summer it made the room quite hot. the bathrooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, and they have a nice kitchen and tv room if you find yourself needing an evening in. highly recommended!"
France,Male,18-24,6.6,8,6,10,4,4,6,8,"the hostel in itself was good. one woman of the staff was welcoming, not the other.  luggages left on the common room at arrival.   the ammount due on my booking was different of the ammount due on arrival.  there was a piano. the room was big for not that much people.  no outlets in the rooms, wifi???"
Spain,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,8,8,perfect budget hostel in hollywood. management was very helpful and very nice. rooms were fairly clean and cozy. hostel cleanliness was overall fair.   the only concern is i wish they had better breakfast and not a self-service kitchen
Ireland,Couple,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,"hostel is grand for one or two night, very central, no locker room for luggage but staff seem to be there most times during the day."
NewZealand,Female,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"could have done with air con (or at least a fan in the room) but otherwise an excellent hostel - very close to hollywood, very nice and helpful staff."
England,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,amazing location!
Russia,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,it was my second stay in this hostel. ive been in some hostels in los angeles and so far this hostel is my favorite. its very quiet - doest fell like a hostel at all more like living in a big house.  needless to say that the location is perfect.
England,Female,18-24,5.7,6,6,10,6,4,2,6,"the only good thing about this hostel was location. great location right behind the kodak theatre. staff were rude, hostel had no character or atmosphere. never saw anyone around and when you did it was older people who never talked. hostel is a money grabber too. $5 per person just for a piece of paper with the wi fi code on, $2 per towel.  showers were a small hole in the wall which if you're tall you'd be lucky to fit in and there was only one shower per floor for around 20 people on a floor."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,my friend and i had a fantastic experience with the hostel.  it was perfectly located to where we wanted to go &amp; the staff was exceedingly friendly. we loved our room &amp; the facilities were perfect. we'd definitely stay there again &amp; would have no problem recommending our friends to stay there.
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"the location can't be beat, and our host was very hospitable. we stayed in a private double, and although it was a bit warm at night because there was no air conditioner, we felt we had chosen exactly the right place to stay!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,very nice hostel and helpful staff. great location close to hollywood blvd.
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location. it is the quiet street behind all of the hustle and bustle of hollywood blvd. it is right under magic castle, a famous private club on a hill that is dedicated to magicians from all over.  i was told that marilyn monroe lived there when she was still norma jean. they have an old fashion telephone (not in service) and wooden telephone booth.  literally walk around the corner and you are in the midst of the action. parking $5 per night which is a nice. i would stay there again."
Norway,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff really did excellent service! they worked for more than one hour to provide us transport, which they normally do not do!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,friendly &amp; helpful staff. perfect location right behind hollywood strip. close to public transport. nice safe area.  had all the needs &amp; essentials for a backpacker. would definitely stay here again.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,5.7,2,6,10,4,8,4,6,"exellent location, but amennities poor. no towels for shower, bed was uncomfortable, also pillows very thin, no television and had to use a shared bathroom. value for money poor. if all you want is a place to crash for the night then this is ok since location is exellent, otherwise very average."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,the hostel is located in an excellent position in hollywood. safe area about 50 meters to the walk of fame on hollywood boulevard. just far enough away from the action so you can get a good nights sleep if you wish. the hostel is an old mansion nothing special but not to bad either. great value for money i have stayed here on 2 occasions now. they staff are friendly and helpfull.
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,10,4,8,8,8,"i loved the location and the staff even though they gave us the wrong room and we were forced to have a shared bathroom instead of private ensuite. the price was excellent and the house is beautiful. the shared bathrooms however are uncomfortably small and that is far from an exaggeration. i could barely manage to shave my legs without sticking them out the shower. the common room is a great space, wish there would be gaming consoles for rent at the desk or something fun!"
Canada,Couple,18-24,8,6,6,10,8,10,10,6,"super great location, you can walk less than a minute and your already on hollywood blvd, grauman's chinese, dolby theatre , el capitan etc. the staff was really friendly. the breakfast is oatmeal without any flavors, so if you want something more constistant, you will have to go buy yourself food at the market (which is really close though). great hostel in general, i would recommend it more for the location and staff than anything else. there wasn't any room service proposed."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"i cannot tell you how happy i was to check into this hostel from the nightmare one before this.    this hostel is seconds away from hollywood blvd, but on a quiet side-street so you don’t get the noise of the madness while trying to sleep.  i booked into a solo room on the top floor and it was one of, if not the, best hostel room i have ever stayed in; it was light, i could open windows and let air in, the sheets, while worn, were clean and i could take my shoes off without fear of what was ingrain"
China,Male,18-24,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,8,10,"the location of this hostel is perfect, the coupon which was offered by reception -- sherry's cafe or sth like that, the breakfast they offered was really really sucks. anyway, in general , this place is awesome !!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,very close to the main parts of hollywood. is very quiet and relaxing - the perfect place to stay when you've had a long haul from australia.
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,8,10,10,"a nice place.  the location was great - a quiet place to sleep but close to the action. the place had character, containing lots of random vintage/antique items.  it was clean and quiet, but had a large indoor area if you wanted to just lounge around.  the breakfast was nothing special, but it's already a cheap stay and at least you get free tea/coffee all day.  not a party hostel, if that's what you're looking for, but a place to rest your head after a long day/night of exploring or partying."
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,"this hostel was located in the heart of hollywood, a great location and an amazing old house with so much character. the communial bathrooms are a bit dingy but nothing unbareable. there were no lockers or any safe spots to store valuables like passports and laptops and the 4 bunk dorm didnt allow much if any room for movement. the staff member named keith was great, happy to help and really accommodating but all the other staff were quite rude."
Sweden,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,4,10,6,4,"thew staff was very nice , but the cleaning could be better. in the hostel it was very quiet, so  the hostel is perfekt if you want to be close to walk of fame and the entertainments there. we decided after the  first morning to have breakfast somewhere else. there are plenty of coffieshops in the aria."
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"was very impressed by our stay at orange drive manor, compared to an awful motor inn down the road. very clean and safe area despite being just off the main strip. staff were very helpful and always made themselves as helpful as they could with any questions or issues. parking off street was great and room was great. i will not hesitate in rebooking this hostel next time i'm back in la. you guys are doing a great job!"
Uruguay,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,8,10,"it was good located in hollywood, only about 3 blocks from the dolby theatre and chinese theatre theatre. the only bad thing about the hostel was the curtains. they were too thin and white and had to open our eyes at about 7 o'clock because of the sunlight."
Australia,Couple,31-40,5.7,6,4,8,6,4,6,6,"staff were unfriendly and the room was very basic (2 beds and an open bathroom/toilet combo). the hostel didn't have a party vibe, but was still incredibly noisy thanks to the thin walls loud floors. located just around the corner from hollywood blvd, it's in a good spot if you're there for the chinese theatre and star boardwalk, etc. i've stayed in a lot of places and this was close to the noisiest hostel i've been in."
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,was very impressed with the location and the facilities in the kitchen! the wifi access was however a bit tempremental - it would have been nice to have definitive access in our bedroom as this is what we paid for.   we thought that the oven in the kitchen was a little unsafe as it became burning hot and difficult to touch.   overall though we throughly enjoyed out stay
Slovenia,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"nice place,great and safe location,metro is just araund the corner....could be a little bit cleaner!"
Slovenia,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great hostel and great location, very nice house, if you go to hollywood ,  and you need place to stay, choose this hostel!"
Australia,Couple,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"the only issue was that the bath mats needed to be washed more often consider the amount of people who use the showers.  other that that i absolutely loved the place, the location was excellent, the staff were amazing and helpful and the hotel was clean and safe.    next time we stay in hollywood we are definately staying there again."
Austria,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,a really cool hostel in a great location. we had a double with shared facilities: there are a lot so no hustle if house is full. we had a lovely room and staff was friendly and welcome. i would definetly stay there again!!!
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,5.1,2,6,8,6,2,6,6,staff was too unkind and they looked they cared only money not customer's convenience.
FalklandIslands(malvinas),Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,10,4,10,4,8,kitchen was far too small.  location was great though.
Australia,Couple,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,the hostel was in a great position so close to hollywood blvd.  the staff were very helpful when we had questions or needed information.  the only problem we had during our stay was the noise during the early hours of the morning when some of the other occupants were partying.
Germany,Female,41+,8.6,10,10,10,6,8,8,8,very charming hostel in a great location.                                  loved the runyon canyon right down the street. best views of la. this hostel is very quiet and was just what i needed.
England,Male,41+,6.9,6,8,10,6,8,6,4,"having not stayed in hostels before i didnt know what to expect.  i was travelling with 4 other guys and were only staying 2 nights,  we found the hostel adequate for what we wanted as we were just passing through la.  it appeared a bit tired and run down but is in a fantastic location for touring la and the price was good as we just wanted a place to get our heads down."
England,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"beautiful, 'vintage style' house, really is only a 2 minute walk from the buzz of hollywood boulevard, cheap to egt to from the airport as well.  helpful staff, i loved this place!"
Australia,Male,41+,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,the best thing about this hostel is its position literally just a couple of minutes walk to hollywood bvd.  staff very pleasant and helpful.  a little pricey though but it was worth it for the convenience.
England,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,6,8,8,8,really handy location for visiting the hollywood sights and it was much cheaper than hotels nearby. the staff were very friendly and helpful.
Germany,Female,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location!
Canada,Couple,31-40,6.3,6,8,10,4,4,6,6,"no free wi-fi!!! you had to pay $5 for the duration of your stay (expensive)! the free breakfast is poor - just oatmeal, and not even the microwave-able kind! the staff was not there at the counter to let us in when we arrived. when they are there, they are usually friendly. they charge security deposit of $50 in cash for the keys. when you enter the room, there's a long list of rules on the back of the door. check-out seems too early at 10am (5$ for later check-outs). showers spray weirdly."
Canada,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"the whole place was not very bright, a little gloomy, kitchen too small, tv room too small. no lockers in the room, no free internet. the beds were very noisy, kept me awake. close to hollywood blvd, good location, close to metro (good), felt pretty safe and it was pretty clean."
Wales,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,the orange manor drive hostel is in a great location for you to visit the main part of hollywood blvd. its moments away from the kodak theatre. its also easy to get to universal city and universal studios via the metro which is about 5 mins walk away. there is a supermarket and post office near by. staff were friendly and i think most of the staff lived at the hostel themselves. showers and bathrooms were clean. we stayed in a private double which was spacious and had a heater which was great.
USA,Couple,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,great place to stay right  in hollywood. parking lot in the back if you have a car. we had a private room. cannot get a cheaper room in this area for sure! nice helpful staff. in a quiet street with trees. really liked it!
England,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great old building in a superb location. just round the corner from the heart of hollywood, yet surprisingly quiet. pleasant staff, recommended."
Brazil,Female,31-40,6,4,8,10,4,8,6,2,"the place is very well located (close to hollywood blvd and kodak theater) and has a lot of character. the guy that help me during check in was very nice, so was the polish girl working there. but first they put me in a wrong room, with unclean bathroom. after complaining i was transfered me to the room i booked, but that had very unclean bathroom (hair/nose bugs) and the room was very noisy. i could hear the other rooms, the bathroom outside my room, people upstairs. i left next morning."
China,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"everything is very well, but the bed is too soft"
Canada,Female,,7.4,4,10,10,6,10,8,4,"all was good except that the room smelled old and moldy, and didn't feel very clean."
SriLanka,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"very convenient location, 3-5mins walk to hollywood walk of fame and chinese theater - free wireless even in rooms not just in common areas - good value for money - only issue is very small bathroom/ toilets in private rooms, but if its for few days you'll survive -  if you're staying in la stay in hollywood because all tours starts in this area and all attractions are nearby as well, there's absolutely nothing to do in main los angles city and its just so boring in that part of la."
England,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"perfect location. friendly staff, easy parking. some noise from other rooms but no big issue. definitely recommend."
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,4.9,2,4,10,6,4,2,6,this hostel has no atmosphere whatsoever. everyone keeps to themself and the staff encourages that by being mostly invisible
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"change the oatmeal brand and/or add more free breakfast options. the oatmeal really didn't have any flavor. other than that, i was pleased with mainly everything."
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,6,8,"great location, 2 min walk to chinese theatre on walk of fame. our private room (shard b/room) was spacious."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,8,10,8,8,4,8,"great location - a stone's throw from walk of fame and kodak theatre. great in most ways, but not so well suited to meeting people and need to have more events, i.e. bar crawls, etc. otherwise very happy with all."
China,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"why did they charged a customer who  did not stay in there hostel  and cancelled 24 hours before arrival,  i don't get it !!!!    i want my money back and want them to realize it is so wrong!     i also cancelled another hostel called duohousing in l.a. they charged me 2 bucks."
India,Couple,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,4,8,"the room got really hot at night and there was no airconditioning or fan. this was in november, i wouldn't dare rent a room in the summer."
Netherlands,Couple,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,6,6,6,8,"not a very special place, but the location can't be beaten, it is right behind the chinese theatre!"
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,8,"this hostel is all about the location - right around the corner from the kodak theatre, chinese theatre, hollywood walk of fame and the highland metro stop providing easy access to universal studios. the staff were great - very welcoming and friendly. definitely, the best value for money if you want to see hollywood in a couple of days."
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"stayed one night, will stay again. great friendly service and facilities."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,0,10,10,0,8,6,8,"excellent location. there too few showers, only rwo or three for the entire hostel."
Sweden,Male,31-40,7.3,0,8,8,0,8,8,6,i can recomend it if your not that fuzzy about clenliness.
Germany,MixedGroup,18-24,7.3,0,8,10,0,8,4,6,"it may be not the cheapest hostel and for sure not the newest one.  the 'breakfast' might not be existend, the walls are pretty thin and the bathrooms are as old as the house.   but for this location it's def the best deal you can get.  you get to all the hotspots in about 1 to 25min by car, there are lots of restaurants in the neighbourhood, two movie theaters, a bowling place, shisha bars,..  if you don't expect a lot and the only thing you want to do in the hostel is sleeping it's good enough."
Italy,Female,31-40,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"excellent! great location, private parking and helpful  staff.."
Russia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"we stayed in private room, private bathroom so this may make things a bit better, but still this is one of the best hostels in my experience. it gives everythig i need - perfect location, quiet, clean, parking place (add $10).   our room had cloakroom which was very nice.  they only thing can be better - breakfast is not complimentary. for $5 i didn't give it a try."
Ireland,Couple,25-30,8.7,0,10,10,0,10,6,8,"great location,friendly and helpful staff. would recommend it to anyone staying in hollywood on a budget!"
Germany,Couple,18-24,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,6,"this place has a fantastic location, it's just off hollywood blvd!! if u wanna go downtown or to the beaches, just take the metro or the bus which stops are just a min's walking away. be aware tho, their breakfast is cereals (bring your own milk!), u have to pay for wi-fi, and they have no air-con so it can get quite hot in your room. also u'll need your time to get used to their beds since the matresses are kinda wrapped in a plastic coating. the walls are paper thin."
England,Male,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,6,10,"excellent hostel, really close to everything in hollywood for a really cheap deal"
Spain,Female,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,they might  change the mattress!!!!
France,Female,31-40,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"the staff was helpfull. it was a little bit noisy because i could hear the noise outside,  but the best thing about this hostel is the location, it's very close to the best place to see the walk of fame. the room was ok but i couldn't turn the air conditioning on so it was very hot. i would recommand this hostel."
Australia,Female,31-40,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,6,8,no aircon or fans for summer but the staff try not to place you in the hot rooms. really lovely old house &amp; facilities are good. the shower cubicles are tiny though. for someone who has only stayed in 4-5 star hotels this was not too much of a shock as an introduction to hostels.
NorthernIreland,Male,25-30,4.7,0,6,10,0,6,2,2,the hostel didnt have a tv in the rooms and smelt fusty. the rooms are dated and very expensive with what you got. when we turned up they tried to charge us more money for paying by card when the fee we agreed to pay on hostelworld was printed on our booking. they also tried to charge for internet which wasnt clear on the booking.  we were very disappointed with this place and left after 1 night when we were supposed to stay 4. went and paid another $20 a night and stayed in the best western whic
Austria,Female,25-30,7.7,0,6,10,0,8,6,8,"nice quiet hostel in a very convenient location, two out of 3 of the staff is very nice, 20 key deposit is a bit much especially if you are leaving the states the next day. and i would not call instant coffee and oatmeal without milk free breakfast."
England,Female,18-24,7,0,6,10,0,4,4,8,staff unwelcoming and not particularly knowledgeable about surrounding areas. we stayed in a private room which was cosy but had no sink and only one tiny shower room on the corridor.   kitchen facilities and storage space for food is also very small and gets busy quickly.   no services to help out with travel.. wish we'd stayed in usa hostel where they offer free shuttles to the beach.
Germany,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"super awesome location. its right behind the kodak theatre (known from the oscar awards) and its right next to the walk of fame! the rooms are nice and there is internet access, a tv room and a nice kitchen where you can warm up your leftovers!"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,6,10,loved this hostel. def not a party hostel but really enjoyed the chilled back atmosphere and the location was excellent - right on hollywood boulevard
England,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,0,4,10,0,8,6,4,"this hostel seem to be after your money at every stage. credit card payments were at a surcharge per night, wi-fi was at a charge, lockers were only available at a cost, even the free breakfast of cereal and a hot drink required you to provide your own milk!!! the rooms were unbearably hot and one of us encountered bites during sleeping there.  the kitchen was tiny and didn't offer much in the way of utensils. also there were no towels in the toilets for drying your hands."
Belgium,Couple,25-30,7,0,8,8,0,8,6,4,great location (for those who want a lodging in hollywood). cheap parking ($5/day) !!! but very small and not-always-very-clean bathrooms
Israel,Female,18-24,6.7,0,6,10,0,8,4,8,"great location, no doubt, but...  it really feels more like an alders house then a hostel. no music, no character, no activities. nothing.   good for bed &amp; breakfast maybe.  hostel is an affordable place for students or just young people who come to a foreign place to have fun, the fun starts at the place you stay."
Brazil,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,10,8,8,6,6,"it is right in the heart of hollywood so if you are a movie lover that's the place to be! close to transportation, restaurants and it has parking space. nice stay."
Germany,Female,25-30,7.7,0,6,10,0,6,6,10,very nice hostel in a great location right next to hollywood boulevard. there are some strange people at the hostel that seem to live there.   the guest kitchen is really really small and the common room has not enough tables.   they charge you $5 per night for parking  and the internet is also not free: $5 for wireless access or pay per minute on their computers!  however we enjoyed our stay.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,0,10,10,0,6,6,8,the location of this hostel is great as it is in the center of hollywood especially for the price but the house is really old and pretty run down. there is no ac so every morning it felt like we were waking up in a tent especially since the morning sun shined straight into the windows when it came up at like 6am and the really isn't enough showers for the amount of people in the hostel. the kitchen down stairs is good plus but the $50 key deposit is a bit steep.
SouthKorea,Female,41+,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,6,10,everything is just perfect but shower^^
Australia,Male,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,staff were great! location outstanding!! only wish i known more about the non hollywood aspects of la before i left... ie fairfax ave :)
Australia,Couple,31-40,8.7,0,10,10,0,10,4,10,"this is a great hostel and in the best location you could ask for. the staff were fantastic and the room very clean. the hostel also had great security. this is more a hotel than hostel, so if you are looking to party, don't stay here because its quiet and relaxing, just the way we liked it."
Finland,Female,31-40,7.3,0,6,10,0,8,6,6,"very good location, friendly and helpful staff."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.7,0,6,10,0,8,4,4,"the staff where extremely helpful at all times and the location was outstanding, although the bathrooms in particular were unclean. hairs stuck everywhere and old dirty soaps and things similar left there for days.   all in all though, it was a value for money, great stay."

NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.7,0,6,10,0,10,8,8,"i adore this place, and will always stay here when in la. if you want a part hostel then please stay away! this is not for you. but if you want a friendly place to stay which has character and the best location, this place is great. i love how it is so unique and that is it not just a ""chain"" hostel. i also stayed in 2004 and enjoyed it then too."
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"very quiet, clean hostel with perfect location (heart of hollywood, near major transport links)."
Canada,Female,18-24,6.3,0,6,10,0,8,4,4,"room was nice and big. but discovered lots of random objects lying around from past visitors (speakers, toothbrush, fortune cookie paper??) which led us to believe that it was really not cleaned often. bathroom felt a bit gross, wore flip flops in the room. pillows very uncomfortable.  no breakfast in the morning, just make-your-own instant coffee. however, the staff was extremely helpful. ps!! i highly recommend heading over to runyon canyon nearby, beautiful hikes, celebrities go there!"
Singapore,Male,31-40,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,10,"nice helpful staff like laura, b &amp; leslie sure made our stay happy!!!  love the bedroom that we had though the morning sun shining thru!!!  love the front porch of the hostel!!! sure doesnt look like a hostel when i was searching for it in the night!!! so peaceful!!!"
Sweden,Female,18-24,6.3,0,10,8,0,4,6,6,"i didn´t like this hostel at all. at first we couldn´t find the place because there was no sign saying orange drive manor hostel, just a locked house, kind of creepy really. when we were inside the staff was not that friendly though there were a man who was very nice. we stayed in a female dorm and it was clean and all but the whole place was impersonal. it was close to hollywood boulevard and if you like typically tourist stuff you will love it but i thought it was dull."
Canada,Female,31-40,9,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,"i would stay here again if i'm in la. the location was fantastic, the hostel clean and secure. i saved a lot of money by being able to walk and use the subway system to get to the places i wanted to see. highly recommended."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.7,0,6,8,0,4,4,6,"good location, just off hollywood blvd. multiple bathrooms is always good. quiet hostel if you want to go sightseeing and then get some rest at night. not to sure about some of the people staying there though. a few long term ""guests"" more like transients."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9,0,10,10,0,8,8,10,"location....location....location if you want the hostel in la with best location, this is it just steps away from hollywood blvd. great to have secure off street parking in la too even if it is $5 extra per night"
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.3,0,8,10,0,8,4,6,good location - very close to hollywood boulevard and metro station. lots of people seem to live there and it´s not very social.
Netherlands,Male,25-30,7.7,0,4,10,0,10,8,6,"the hostel was very nice, staff were great friendly and fun, it is clean but very noisy, and the showers are really bad. i would definatly recommend it, but there are some things that may annoy you."
Canada,Male,41+,8,0,8,8,0,10,6,8,"all in all it was a good stay. bed was a little stiff and the fact one has to pay for internet that was spotty at best was a minus. staff was great, place was clean and secure, and location to downtown hollywood was also great.    close to subway travel and local supermarket for food.     the only negative was the fact that i paid about $3 more per night than if i had booked directly through the hostel."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,9,0,8,8,0,10,8,10,"very good hostel. the staff were very helpful and it was very clean, i will be staying there again"
Sweden,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,4,8,"this is a wonderful hostel in the center of hollywood. it's just off the walk of fame but still far away enough to let you sleep at night. parking is only $10 and securely in the back!  the house is big and beautiful. it's safe and the staff is very helpful. there isn't much room to hang out in, but you have entire l.a. to do so in!  this hostel is highly recommended by me and my friends! i'd stay there next time i visit l.a."
England,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"the location of the hostel was perfect and security was good. however, there was no guest laundry which wasn't stated on the description of the hostel when we were booking, although using the local laundry service turned out to be cheaper than in most hostels. the polish lady on reception was extremely helpful and friendly, however, the man who was on duty when we arrived was new and could have done with a lot more taining, as we were left feeling very confused with misinformation."
USA,Female,41+,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"this is my favorite place to stay in hollywood. quiet! parking! fabulous location. not for the party hearty crew, but perfect for a taste of old hollywood."
Italy,Couple,31-40,7.7,0,8,10,0,8,4,8,"just 5 minutes walking from a subway station, it is a good location in hollywood. there is a excellent supermarket near. the kitchen is small, but good. the place is a nice house and the room was very confortable. it is really a good option in this region."
UK,Female,25-30,5.3,0,8,8,0,4,4,2,"i booked orange drive manor hostel for a recent stay in los angeles on a holiday that was a mixture of hostel and nice hotels.  on the internet it looked charming, the reality was different! aside from the naked man who lived on the third floor and didnt throw anything out the cleanliness was awful! couldnt wait to get out of the shower quick enough! it could have been lovely, they have tried to add character with old furniture but instead just looked decrepid. location, while central was onlyok"
Australia,Male,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"good hostel, right off the hollywood walk of fame.   it was not the most fun place, but it was all that you need"
France,Male,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"very nice hostel, right by the hollywood boulevard, with a private parking ! staff is also friendly. hostel looks a bit old, but very quiet and yet a common room. great !"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,0,6,10,0,6,4,6,"there was nothing really wrong with the place, just not outstanding. the location is great, if you're going to spend time in hollywood (which we were bored of in 10mins), but otherwise its just a place to crash and if thats all you need then no problems here"
Brazil,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,10,0,8,4,8,perfect location!! the best square in hollywood!    this is not a party hostel.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"omg it isn’t a hostel:it is a family!!!even i am living in la and i am traveling around instead of a hotel or staying with friends  i always come back here.i made so many friendships all over the world.everyone who is here in la should make this awesome experience.no matter if u r coming alone,with your friends or even with your family. u only see smiling faces here.😊👍🏻"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"very quaint and cozy. friendly staff, free breakfast, and not over crowded. would recommend to a friend!"
Spain,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,8,8,10,"the place is very nice with many facilities, and a great breakfast. little detail is that you're asked to pay more than the original price in hostelworld, but apparently it's a tax in every hostel in ca."
Malaysia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything is great! you wouldn't feel regret staying here ! 
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,10,10,4,8,8,10,"the beds are comfortable. people in the common area are too noisy for those who want to sleep after 10.  the breakfast is fabulous!  proximity to buses and metro is excellent  no kitchen...food prep. is only a microwave, toaster oven, frig and sink."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic place to stay - great location, it is a very small hostel but with great facilities. the staff are lovely and helpful. the beds were comfortable and the rooms nice and big. unfortunately there was no locker space in the bedrooms and no where to place your bags.   the only downside is that the common area where everyone eats breakfast is on the same floor, and adjacent to the bedrooms, this means it is very noisy in the morning from 7am. "
Spain,Male,25-30,6.9,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,"this was my experience, first the directions were wrong and i found myself in a very dangerous neighbourhood at night where i was supposed to transfer from the metro to a bus that simply didn't run on weekends. quite scary. once i checked in, i left to get food in the area and  2 bad experiences in 15 minutes that were extremely dangerous (i was chased by two dealers and by a man on a car). so, the area made me feel truly unsafe and uneasy. keep that in mind, especially if you're a solo female."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"nice place, with friendly stuff and people. i recommend it :) "
Indonesia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,10,8,great place! definitely recommended!
Colombia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place!! the staff makes you like home. really nice people. the roof is amazing.
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"good hostel and people were great, but when i booked it the rating was a 9.3 which i think is a little overrated. it was def an 8 though. good price n p homie. breakfast is sweet."
England,Couple,25-30,6.9,8,4,6,8,8,6,8,"we had a bit of an issue with a girl in the room who brought back a random guy at 4am which is fine as long as you come in quietly as there are 8 other people sleeping but no they decide its the perfect time for some sexy time, not being subtle about it either. i mentioned it to reception and he said no one else was in her booking meaning he wasnt even meant to of been staying there. the staff were really good and dealt with it straight away. only issue is security as ovbs anyone can walk in "
Brazil,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,6,10,"good hostel! clean and organized. however, this is not a party hostel, where you can find a cool atmosphere. this a good place to sleep at night."
Russia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,"clean. close to hollywood, near a bus stop. breakfast is available. recommended.  locks are not free."
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,cleanest hostel i’ve ever stayed in
Peru,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,6,10,10,8,10,"i loved the staff, the only two low points i see is one the internet don't work everywhere! and two the check in time is too late but was cool they let me storage the bags and wait ;) "
England,Female,18-24,5.4,6,8,4,6,6,2,6,"atmosphere is top priority as a solo traveller hoping to meet people and this hostel really didn't meet expectations. room was decent considering the amount of people in there but could be noisy from the streets and the bathrooms always seemed to be covered in hair. the shuttle they offered didn't have enough people signed up so never seemed to run. location wasn't great, seems you need to catch an uber everywhere (seems to be the case everywhere in la).wouldnt recommend to other solo travellers"
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,10,8,6,10,"this is not a very social hostel but it's a very nice hostel. you have to try to meet people which is possible, but the vibe is not very social. other than that the facilities are very clean and staff are very friendly.  i stayed in freehand hostel la previously and i prefer this one. "
India,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome stay !  good breakfast !  only issue - didn't stay to the deal regarding allotted bed.  otherwise good people. nice environment.
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,6,10,8,10,great staff. ok area. plenty around to eat. there's a bit of a wait for toilets and showers but it's a small place so they have done the best they can with the room they have.  the roof top is pretty cool.  i'd stay again
China,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,melrose is a wonderful and safe place! the staff are so friendly and the breakfast and facilities are nice. there are more than one bathroom so you can always find one available. it's near the bus station so best for backpacker travelling by bus. i would definitely come again if visiting la!
USA,Female,31-40,7.4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,"this place was clean and organized and had a good breakfast. they have a cute little rooftop, too. there isn't much to do in the immediate surroundings but if you are willing to walk a mile you can find some cool stuff. they also have a bus stop across the street."
Thailand,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,very good thanks a lot
Denmark,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,quiet and clean place with all you need  except for a washingmaschine. really nice breakfast
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"hostel a bit out of the way but think that's due to la being such a big city. staff were amazing, the hostel always had something going on and the vibe was fun :)"
England,Female,31-40,6.9,6,10,8,4,6,4,10,"for the past 20 years i've stayed in many hostels travelling and this one reminds more of a university/youth crash pad 'money maker' than an actual backpacker's hostel. the lack of an actual kitchen it's a huge disadvantage as you have no choice but to either eat a take out or a pre-packaged food in throw away plates and cutlery. and when i asked one of the staff if they had any real bowls so i could make myself some ramen noodles in the microwave the answer was 'no, cos they kept breaking'!!!"
Australia,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,i loved the breakfast. there were lockers to put valuables into. the staff were amazing. they were always willing to help. there were around 50 people staying there when i was there. this meant it was probably hard for staff to keep things clean. i liked watching movies in the common area. wifi was great when not using at the peak time when everyone was around. i'd go back for sure. it was also easy to get to and make your way around la
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,8.3,10,10,6,6,10,6,10,"the staff at the melrose hostel are very nice and kind. the hostel has an unusual layout for the restrooms and showers. you have to walk through the commons area to reach the bathrooms and/or showers. the female dorm was comfortable. it's a huge room and has lockers. the breakfast was very good. overall, the hostel was clean. i only stayed one night because i had reservations at another hostel.  "
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,4,10,10,10,"great stay. lovely friendly staff. comfortable beds with clean and spacious dorms. one negative - led to believe there'd be self catering facilities, which was only a microwave."
Belgium,Female,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,6,10,8,8,the hostel is new but the interior made it look old and not so fresh (but it is a clean place). staff is realy friendly and helpfull and they have a very good breakfast! 
China,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,the staff there is very helpful and the breakfast is really delicious!
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,6,8,10,6,10,"the beds in this hostel are great! super comfy and the room was really clean... the staff were really friendly and helpful. there's a big tv and sofas and people generally just lounge around and chill. i didn't realise how big la was, somewhere closer to the city centre maybe would have been better, expect to be übering around a lot! "
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,it's a great hostel. it's located in koreatown. very nice staff and close to the hollywood walk of fame!  
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"this was the cleanest hostel i've stayed in in a while. also had a much better breakfast that most hostels. otherwise a fairly typical hostel, nice people, good experience. "
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"amazing place, reliable wi-fi, delicious breakfast, clean rooms and common areas, bathrooms could be a little cleaner. location is good, almost hollywood but you still need to take public transportation, there are bus stops nearby taking you to a lot of places of interest. atmosphere was really good, but there were a lot of groups when i was there so as a single backpacker it was harder to socialize, but they have several social events. one of the best places i've stayed."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"really chill hostel, great breakfast. relatively close to hollywood, especially if you're using public transport or uber. not super social or loud but that's what i liked about it. very clean. "
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was exceedingly pleasant in every way and exceeded my expectations in a number of categories. terrific breakfast, access to the city and food, but by far the most exceptional aspect of my stay was the staff. they were always incredibly helpful and when a payment issue arose they went above and beyond to rectify the situation."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing staff that really made me feel welcome and at home. the place is clean, the breakfast is generous and the beds were comfortable! good spacious area to relax after a long day and i just can't fault the hostel. the family are lovely people! always smiling and helpful.

Philippines,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"possibly the best hostel i've been to so far (in any country). all was perfect, cleanliness, security, friendliness ... also quite reasonable in price (i paid approx 38$ per night on average)"
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay! staff are lovely, the place is very clean. they do a really great free breakfast. there's buses pretty much right outside your door to take you where you need to go! :) "
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great hostel. only just opened but great atmosphere to chill watching tv with lovely staff. central door and room door is coded and get small locker in room, no room for big bags though. beds have electricity sockets so can charge. breakfast was awesome pastries, toast, cereal, fruit, yoghurt!!! bathrooms nice and clean. 20 min walk to a metro line"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"one of my favorite hostels already. what sets them apart from most hostels in la, is that they truly care- incl. management+employees, &amp; truly embrace you like old friends. they're also v professional, accommodating, plenty of reources/equipments, even discount cards for restaurants around! also one of the cleanest hostels i've been to no joke! smells fresh&amp;clean, surprising as a hostel! they also have a rooftop! cozy colorful layout, plenty of bathrooms; s/o to doris&amp;andrew :)"
Scotland,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,8,10,10,"great hostel as a base in la, you can jump on public transport easy but la is much better to explore if you have a car! would recommend taking uber as it works out cheaper than metro/bus! hostel was clean and secure with great breakfast in the morning! only downside is the lack of showers, only 3 for the whole hostel witch meant you intern had to wait a while"
Germany,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"very friendly staff, very clean, great breakfast. unfortunately no real kitchen for cooking. rooms are a very good size, beds are comfortable."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,this hostel is quite a walk from the main attractions of hollywood but it's well connected by metro for both hollywood and downtown. the vibe here is really nice and the breakfast was good!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,this was my first time traveling alone and this was the perfect hostel to stay! the staff were all really helpful and super accommodating and all the people were friendly too. 
USA,Male,31-40,2.9,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,"stiff mattresses, poor ventilation, etc. do not believe the average high rating."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,6,8,10,8,8,a nice hostel for a few days. very good breakfast with a lot of variety. expect a lot of people in your room. staff is very nice and helpful. 
USA,Female,18-24,4.3,4,6,6,4,4,2,4,not a good place overall   not at all the feeling of an youth hostel ...  sad place ...  please avoid!
Thailand,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,very kind staff and good breakfast!
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i've stayed at! staff were friendly and helpful, and the hostel itself was excellent - especially the rooftop terrace. amazing free breakfast every morning, large communal lounge, and comfortable and quiet rooms. they have some pretty cool plans for the rooftop terrace so the place will get even better in future.

USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,6,10,"large room with a lot of beds, it is a small place though. you walk upstairs and there are the rooms the kitchen the common area and the bathrooms all in one spot. it's not so much of a let's all get in a group and hang out, it is more so of a place where you just need a place to stay that's clean and comfortable. i would stay again on nights i need to just lay my head. if i was looking to have fun, this isn't the spot for it. "
France,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,no word is good enough to describe it! just a perfect place to stay. amazing staff that make you feel welcome. the breakfast is fantastic i could go on and on... for sure the best best place to stay in la. looking forward to come back!!

USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this is the best hostel i've ever been to. it is also the cleanest hostel i've ever been to. the staff went above and beyond for each guest, like when one volunteered to take some of us to in'nout. great roof, great breakfast, amazing staff. they have daily events, such as free transportation to the griffith observatory, going to a play, and other great ways to make friends with other travelers. the beds and dorms are nice, and the people are nicer. if i come back to la, this is where i'd stay.

"
England,Couple,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the breakfast, i am sorry but this is the best thing about this place, been travelling for a while now and this beats even some hotels that i've stayed in!! the hostel is really secure with locker and keypads on dorms/front door, it is also very clean! the location is okay, we relied on public transport (which is not great in la- but manageable) and you have to get a bus to the nearest metro, or you can get uber/lyft and the hostel have some deals with them! defo would stay here again! "
Canada,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,"i was very happy to find out that the hostel was kept clean including washrooms. this was great. i liked breakfast. everyday there was fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee bread and various spreads. beds were comfortable  and rooms were clean. i liked that each bed had its own socket to plug so there was no need to fight over sockets. the only encounter i had that displeased me was that we were refused to replace our used towels after three days of use even thought it us written in signed contract"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"melrose hostel is very nice.  it is clean, staff is friendly and delicious breakfast.  there is a lot more space in the kitchen and common areas than some other hostels.  only reason i didn't give a perfect score is the neighborhood isn't my favorite and opens to a main road.  i prefer being on a side road with trees on my block.    thanks melrose hostel."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,8,8,8,6,8,"well pried and well located. electric locks on the front door and room door plus lockers in the dorms. friendly staff.     room and facilities were very clean, bed was comfy and i appreciated it being already made as i turned up rather late. was often a wait for a bathroom though. towel provided which was great!    my major dislike was that disposable bowls plates and cutlery were provided for breakfast. this is disgustingly wasteful and i would be reluctant to stay here again for this reason. "
Scotland,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"no kitchen facilities. other than that an awesome hostel and great atmosphere, especially on the roof at night time."
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,6,10,6,10,10,friendly owners and great value. lots of travelers from around the work and a nice social atmosphere. i really enjoyed the roof deck and breakfast buffet! some of the staff could be friendlier but overall a great place that i’d recommend to anyone.

Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i've ever been to. beds are comfy, staff was super nice and accommodated me way above what was expected of them because they want their guests to have the best trip possible. location is ok but in la you need a car or uber anyway. i was a bit sad when i left because there i made friendships that i know will last a lifetime. the atmosphere there is perfect for making new friends, but if you want to just chill alone you can do that too. unpretentious and heartwarming place."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great friendly atmosphere 
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"i absolutely loved my time spent at melrose hostel. the staff were incredibly friendly and fun to talk to -- as were the other guests. the spaces were clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. their rooftop was a delightful place to hang out after the day's adventures. it also provided a great space for the delicious (free!) july 4th bbq -- not to mention a great vantage point for viewing fireworks. and the price was glorious! by far the best bargain i've encountered in the u.s."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place in pretty central location. the place is pretty new so everything is clean and nice :) they also have a great breakfast provided. 
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,10,10,8,8,"i told them i was going to be late for check in (ends at 11pm) and they still accommodated me.     the location is okay depending on where you want to go.     the beds were actually pretty comfy.     the area around to the east of the hotel is pretty sketchy and the closest subway station is to the east so i would recommend going a slightly longer route to the hollywood/western station. i still felt safe in the hostel, there is a lock on the door and cameras.     overall, pretty good stay"
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,they were very nice and made me feel at home. some idiot in the room woke me because i was snoring but he apologized the next day. they do sell ear plugs for people who cant sleep through snoring. all in all it was a great time.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,literally the best hostel i've ever stayed at. the staff are so nice and they are constantly doing things for the guests like a bbq on the 4th of july and movie night.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,good hostel. breakfast exceeded expectations.
Canada,AllMaleGroup,31-40,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay at this hostel. the best part about it for me was meeting several travellers and making new friends. the staff was friendly and the rooftop patio is a great place to socialize. my only suggestion would be to have larger lockers to fit a larger backpack for travellers.
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"nice and friendly hostel. staff was great, excellent customer service. it was a little hard to find parking, but welcome to la. location was good. very comfortable place to hang out and chill."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,it was nice facility and the staff were very accommodating;)
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,i would have liked a chair in the showers
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,6,8,10,this place is very new and just opened in may. overall my stay was good. it is quite clean and probably has to do with it being so new. you kind of feel like you're staying in someone's home; very warm atmosphere. it is very conveniently located being not too far from most sights/tourist spots. my complaints would be the dogs running around from the owners were annoying and barked a lot especially when guests came through the front door. the street in front is very noisey; keep earplugs handy! 
Taiwan,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you are staying for 3-5 days in budget to explore la, and don't wanna switch places frequently, this is the ideal place to stay. plus, as a sole female traveler, i felt safe here. the female bathroom is clean and spacious, and the ambient here is nice. if i come back to la, would definitely stay here again!"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,great place to stay and made some cool people. nice rooftop 
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place in a great location considering how big la is. met some great people, drinks on the rooftop bar, and not a bad breakfast! "
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"great staff, and a fun environment! i had a lot of fun here, and i would stay here again on future trips."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,4,8,8,8,10,"the hostel was really clean and the staff were lovely. the beds were also very nice. the location wasn't that easy to get around and was a good 20-30 to downtown by car, longer to beverly hills and venice. "
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,6,10,10,10,"staff is really nice, they help as much as possible, breakfast is amazing. the only thing i miss is a kitchen where i could make some food for myself. "
Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,10,6,10,8,10,10,10,"i spent a few nights here and it was great, while i was there it was being run by a family who owns the building and they were super accomadating , i met the owners sun who was super helpful and the owner was also super nice   great atmosphere   great location   the only thing i could complain about is that people would leave the doors open for long periods of time , but nothing got stolen because i had good people in my room "
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"family owned and run hostel, the staff are so nice and help with anything you need.  good breakfast included - cereal, bagels, toast, yoghurt and fruit, tea, coffee &amp; juice! good atmosphere, it was easy to meet/ speak to other people! big couch to watch netflix on also rooftop with tables and chairs! there is also a female only bathroom which i liked. plenty of room. you can also get 10% discount at some close by restaurants if you say you're staying here! would definitely stay here again :)  "
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,"we loved the atmosphere at the meltose hostel - the layout of the place was awesome as it meant we could easily interact with other people. the staff were super lovely and the bagels for breakfast were such a treat! the only downside would be the lack of kitchen facilities, making it difficult for us to cook dinners. "
Argentina,Male,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,8,10,"very nice hostel, close to hollywood, very close to many bus stops to go downtown or any place in la.  if they organized activities for their guests would be  the perfect place to stay in. the staff were very gentle."
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,great hostel in a great location. a $5 uber away from sunset and hollywood blvd and only a 20-30 minute journey from lax and other tourist spots. the hostel was really clean and the staff were lovely. also it didn't feel like we were in an 18 bed dorm as the room is so large. would definitely recommend 👍🏼
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,the staff were so welcoming and around all the time. i ha good convasarions with a few of the staff. everything was really clean. there is a lot of space to chill. 
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was expecting my stay in la would be filled with frustration over traffic and difficulties getting around places. well it definitely lived to my expectation! however my stay and view of la has changed through my stay at melrose hostel. i've been travelling to over 50 countries and stayed in many hostels, melrose would be in my top 5 hostel. the hostel has a lovely homey feel about it. the staffs were super friendly and helpful, especially jae! if you stay there, make sure you meet him! "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this place is fantastic. it's only a month or so old but it has everything you need, plus an awesome rooftop hangout that they say will be renovated soon. the place is clean and cozy, the complimentary morning breakfast has everything you need, there's a tv and computer, and it's kept cool/cold. the street parking outside is metered 8-6, but always available, and the morning i left one of the employees went to pay my meter without me even asking. they're great people with a great place."
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we had a great time there! people there was suuupee friendly and nicee and the hostel,is very clean!!  and a good breakfast btw haha "
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,4,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i'm pleased with my stay.  the staff, adali (i'm so sorry if i misspelled your name or mispronounced!!!) but he was outstanding and i want to thank him for the lyft discount.  i'm happy and i can see myself return. i hope to see you guys again!!!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay when traveling and wanting to meet new and interesting people. made the stay very welcoming and family oriented. love the fact you can cook and everyday there was an event planned. great job usa hostel.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved this hostel! the staff were super helpful and friendly, and was always there when you needed. the hostel itself is great, open space and super clean and easy to get around via transport. i met so many great people here too, so worth your money! thanks melrose ave, i'll be staying again for sure 😄"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,there were a lot of beds in the room but i didn't have too much trouble. the common areas were good but there is not a real kitchen so you can't cook. the location is easy to get to by bus or walking to the metro. 
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"easy access to public transport subway/bus makes this hostel easy to get to from the greyhound terminal &amp; to travel around visiting the sites of la. the hostel is very clean &amp; supplies a great healthy breakfast. you have the ability to cook in a microwave &amp; store a small amount of food. they do offer  some free tours which i didn't go on. a good selection of netflix, movies &amp; wifi is moderately ok. the girls bathroom actually has hair dryer &amp; straightener a nice touch for the long term traveller"
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"omg... melrose hostel by far is the best place to spend your vay k at. from the people who host to the atmosphere in general is very welcoming. your money is well spent here since the hostel is located near bus and subway transportation and nearby tasty restaurants. purchase a tap card and pay $7 for an all day pass on the metro. very home like feel huge flat screen with netflix. breakfast and coffee  offered every morning :) very clean bathrooms, rooms and a rooftop you can wind down. 10⭐️stars"
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"melrose hostel is a new and inviting little hostel. they make so much effort to make the hostel feel like home with events such as movie nights! they offer guests discounts to surrounding restaurants and include breakfast! i'm excited to see what they will do to the rooftop area as that could be a real asset to their business. this hostel is small, but comfortable and inviting. 😁✌🏽"
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,they are so nice and friendly
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,8,10,good place to stay. i would come back
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,staff was very friendly and welcoming! great value for money in terms of being pretty central in la only a short drive/lyft from tourist areas and west hollywood!
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"super nice hostel, definitely a recommendation! everything is new and modern. service is great, food is awesome and price is low. and you can take a picture for the wall of former guests:)"
England,Male,25-30,4.3,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,nice hostel but taking time to get bus to metro staion. 
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,6,8,"the owner and staff were exeptionaly helpful and kind! the location is not fantastic, but definitely safe, and only a few blocks down from hollywood, sunset, and santa monica boulevard. the free breakfast is great, and the dorms,showers and common area are well kept and comfortable. i will look to them the next time i'm in la."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"definitely recommend!!! the staff are all really nice and super helpful with any and all questions you have about things to do, how to get around, places to eat, etc. it's brand new (only a few weeks old) so everything is nice and new, and they are adding new stuff all the time! facilities are awesome, very secure and safe, and an extremely friendly atmosphere. was there for less than a day and made friends with like 10 friends from countries all over the world! definitely a travelers dream!"
Switzerland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's a new hostel in a nice area, really close to hollywood. the hostel is clean, with nice dorms, a big leaving room and a rooftop. the breakfast is amazing with bagel, toast, cereals, chees, jam, fresh fruits and much more. the staff are all friendly and helps you if you need something. i definitely will come back to this hostel the next time."
England,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,cheapest hostel in la. nice breakfast. nice staff always ready to help. only a 40 minute walk from hollywood boulevard. bus stops nearby to get to other locations.
China,Female,25-30,8.9,10,6,6,10,10,10,10,"great breakfast and nice staff, location is ok, near a bus stop, very clean and quiet badroom"
Israel,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the stuff is awesome extremely kind and helpful. they made every moment enjoyable and helped with everything we needed. 
Philippines,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent place! they have just opened - which explains the lack of reviews - but it was overall a great experience.  the staff was the friendliest i have come across and it was definitely the best value-for-money deal i have experienced. many of my fellow travelers (including ourselves) extended our stay simply because of the experience. would recommend to everyone. 
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,10,6,8,10,8,8,"this was very good value, provided that you are ok with either taking public transit/cab/shuttle to arrive and leave, or if you are willing to park up to 3/4 mile away and backpack/walk to the location.  breakfast was provided, although my schedule did not allow me to take part.  other guests seemed to provide interesting conversation, although i only spoke with a few people.  on this rather warm day/night, it was a bit warm inside, i believe because they chose to use the ac sparingly in bedroom"
Brunei,Female,41+,6.3,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,i would rate the hostel is just okay for me. i personally do not like the atmosphere at the hostel especially during the day when the staffs are so busy walking around cleaning the hostel and the room seem a bit stuffy as there are many people in one room and the air conditional does not seem to be working well. but their toilets are well clean. the location of this hostel does not seem to be very convenient. 
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've stayed at so far, the atmosphere and location are so good, would recommend to anyone staying in la !"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very happy with my stay at this hostel...so friendly and helpful hosts would not hesitate to recommend this place.
Italy,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel, probably the best. when i arrived the family that owns the place gave me a very warm welcome which i really enjoyed. they made me feel at home and i'm happy to say that i had one of my best times there, endlessly recommended. thank you andrew, adalhi and his family. sorry for the late review, see you soon"
Vietnam,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staffs were extremely helpful and friendly. the hotel was clean and the breakfast was very nice. me and my two friends love the place and will come back again. 
Canada,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"i only stayed one night at melrose hostel, but the stay was awesome! it's a new hostel that just opened in may 2017 so everything is new and clean. andrew was super helpful and gave me a hiking route up griffth park to the observatory. he also gave me very accurate description of the various parts of la. i can see he goes out of his way to help all guests who stay there! wish i can stay longer. maybe next time. highly recommended!!  ps. i was their first canadian visitor! =)"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,brand new place in korea town. facilities are pristine. very friendly and very helpful staff. awesome deal for the price. definitely would come back here. 
Finland,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,"really enjoyed our stay at the newely opened hostel, good location, amazing staff and good breakfast! would come again anytime"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is absolutely the best hostel i've ever stayed at. no seriously my absolute favorite hostel guys lol. incredibly clean &amp; the staff was amazing. i've stayed at quite a few hostels that are ok, but in some way or another miss the mark. not at melrose. the wifi is incredibly fast, and the free breakfast is not just toast &amp; juice, there's an actual variety. very quiet, chill area with some awesome people. if you are traveling to la, short or long term this is the hostel. trust me. "
Indonesia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really really a nice hostel... the staff are friendly.. the breakfast was amazing..
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,very nice and new hostel! it's in a good area close to hollywood with restaurants and shops nearby. staff are very friendly. i totally recommend staying here! 
USA,Couple,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i stayed at the melrose hostel for backpackers for one night only, but the place was super clean and nice. the location was good, not sure about the public transportation because we had a car. the host was great, super kind. i highly recommend this place! "
Denmark,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i've been in, can be recommended! "
Colombia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,10,10,10,8,"i love this hostal, the staff its very nice, i recommend it especially for young people. breakfast perfect. and they have a very nice dog. really i dont understand the bad reviews.    "
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"i had a good stay at the hostel. i met many friendly people and everybody was happy to be there, including the staff.  it has a centric location and is great if you don’t mind a 1 hour commute in transit to get to major destinations.   my one issue during my stay was that i was hit with a wooden board from the top bed that fell on my head."
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,6,10,10,6,6,6,6,"amazing people, location and food that they serve there daily. although i wasn’t informed about a bed bug situation that had been brought to their attention about my exact same bed one week prior to my visit. i woke up the next day with extreme bites all over my body. if you don’t want to be bitten, book another hostel. btw, if you even set your things down on the floor, they’re prone to carrying bugs. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice place. in a quiet neighborhood 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"thank you all! 2nd time at your location and i really y enjoyed both stays. i look forward to next year. always an adventure.   oh, and tyler, you rock!!! please send me any dates or info on carlos. i hope he does well in his upcoming pursuits!  sincerely, dan c"
Canada,Female,18-24,3.4,4,2,4,2,2,6,4,unfortunately my stay at the anderson estates was a lot worse than i had expected. i read previous reviews and had an idea of what i was getting myself into but i didn't expect to be treated as poorly as i was by the staff. they had assigned my bed to somebody else without informing me or assigning me to a new bed. i had nowhere to sleep my first night and the office was closed. when i went to resolve the issue the staff blamed it on me and did not apologize or feel bad at all. 
USA,Couple,18-24,6.6,6,4,6,6,8,8,8,"pretty chill atmosphere, definitely a place for young people. we stayed in a private room and i thought they were joking at first but they gave us this ancient skeleton key for the door that was difficult to use. not a great location, the neighborhood isn't very sketchy its just far away from things if you don't have a car. we got tap cards but the metro wasn't great either. would have taken us over an hour to get to the beach or other places we wanted to go. "
Peru,Female,25-30,4.9,4,2,8,6,6,6,2,"you don't even get what you pay for. the communal kitchen was always dirty. the entire house smelled like urine and weed.  male workers came into female dorms without even knocking (it happen to all of us staying in the dorm, they came in when my roommate was getting dressed).  there are  no lockers, rooms don't have locks (everything is open, no keys), no curtains (not even in the restroom).  i've been to hostels around the world, i never thought the usa one would be so disappointing."
Colombia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"sit by the pool or deep in it; the staff is friendly, and unlike in many other places i stayed they actually want to be here doing what they do.    some guests are possible transplants to la others are just travelers, so you have the right balance. there is also an unwritten code of respect for personal space and privacy, so if you have to work or write that important email, there is the silence and space to do that.    metro is walking distance, and you can go directly to st monica or downtown! :)  "
Finland,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,it's definitely a hostel worth checking out. friendly and helpful staff and the facilities are just something else. quite a fancy hostel i'd say. better than average breakfast and you even get served. nice pool area with a real possibility to sunbathe so if you're lazy enough or too tired you don't even have to hit the beach necessarily.  price is fair and it feels good to pay for the stay with these guys. the metro station is close by which really makes moving around very easy and convenient .
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean hostel , near the subway, economical place and friendly staff"
Australia,Female,31-40,2.9,2,4,2,4,2,2,4,won't stay here again
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect place to be located, very easy to get everywhere &amp; such friendly staff. incredible value for money!! 10/10"
Germany,Female,25-30,6,8,4,6,6,6,8,4,"well, i guess you get what you pay for. unfortunately we were late due to my plane being delayed, so my friend and i were both charged with a  late check-in fee (although we had called before). this fee was stupid- all staff members actually live on the hostel ground and are up, partying all night anyway. the rooms were fine, the beds very comfortable. there were ants everywhere though. you can not lock your belongings. bathrooms were meeh, ok. my friend was put in the wrong room, too. "
NewZealand,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"good place to stay, great atmosphere and only a short walk from metro transport"
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,"this place has a great vibe and is very close to la! walking distance to metro. overall a great experience!  i just want to give some tips just about minor things. the outside bathrooms were a bit dirty and not always stocked (toilet paper, no shelf in 1 bathroom). the sink is outside of the 2 bathrooms, and it was very small with no shelf to put your stuff, except for a brick ledge. the shared room we had didn't have a lock, which was a bit concerning. the kitchen was small and unorganized."
Australia,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the place was disgusting. there were ants all over my bed and next to my bed. no security what so ever. no locks on the doors or lockers to put belongings in. there weren't even blinds on all the windows so any one could look into my room which was severely cramped. toilets were dirty and hard to access. didn't end up staying a single night there, left as soon as i could. couldn't get a refund, staff were rude. book the hostel in santa monica instead and you'll have a lot more value for money. "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,4.9,2,4,6,4,8,6,4,"there are a lot of ants, which irritated me. and few restrooms compared to the number of guests."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,2,6,10,10,10,8,great hostel- don't really get the bad reviews. staff are really nice and its great value for money. good breakfast with a lot of choice. great hostel. 
England,Female,25-30,2.6,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,bad things:  filthy  in a dodgy neighborhood  no locks on doors or secure places for passport  2.5km from nearest grocery store  literally four inches between beds and no side tables or benches for laying stuff out which meant people left stuff all over the floor  someone stole my scarf and all my food  one room had no privacy at all and was ground floor with no curtains on french window style doors        good things:  solid wifi  good breakfast  tv with some games consoles  pool    
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place! free amenities! friendly staff and guests, perfect for traveling artists, musicians, and actors."
USA,Male,31-40,6.3,6,6,8,4,10,8,2,"staff are very nice and helpful. they clean quite a bit, but the facilities themselves are old and falling apart. showers were disgusting. one leaked constantly and flooded the bath. great location; 15 min walk from the train. no air conditioning can make sleeping difficult in the summer (it looked like some rooms had window units, but not mine). breakfast is pretty good. lots of mosquitoes by the pool. i got bit every night. overall weird vibe. no close stores/alcohol.  "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,10,6,i had a amazing time /stay 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great atmosphere, having the pool as the social area, only 10 mins walk from the expo metro line. great value, the neighbourhood has many shops in walking distance."
Chile,Female,18-24,4.9,2,2,8,2,8,10,2,"normally staying at an hostel your expectations for cleanliness aren't that high but if you have to pay a $15 dollar fee per person for it you would hope that you would see where that money goes.to begin with their was lice in my bed, yes.every morning i would wake up with bites around my whole body, it wasn' until the my last day that i saw one moving around my sheets, the bathrooms are decent but the showers are disgusting, you can tell that no one has clean those showers with bleach in weeks."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,if you're staying in la and want to meet all kinds of beautiful people from around the world then this is the only place to stay. location was great and the mansion itself blew my mind. the pool is amazing and the staff are great. loved it!  
England,Male,25-30,7.4,10,4,6,8,8,10,6,"saw the reviews on this and was pleasantly surprised when i saw it. swimming pool, cool people, super cheap, breakfast was decent, area was a little dodgy but i walked around at night and lived to tell the tail so it's all good. i left my laptop in my room and didn't get stolen so nothing but good things to say about the place"
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6,4,4,8,4,10,8,4,i was worried i had brought bedbugs back with me for about a month.. saw some beg bug spray left out in room and some people in my room were bit by something.. place was a mess nice staff.. wasn't horrible.. wasn't amazing.. had to walk a few blocks to get a free breakfast.. 
Mexico,Male,25-30,3.7,4,2,8,4,4,2,2,"if you are looking for the nastiest, most ghetto hostel in la, look no further, from sheets with blood, this 3rd world hostel will not disappoint you, come and stay at la's greatest show. from living rooms and other amenities rooms changed to bunk beds, to bathrooms barely accesible. prepare yourself for a thrilling experience of getting into a lottery of who's staying at the 'mansion' and who will be staying at some random unfinished house from a nearby area."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"loved the security guard at the front of the street. very kind individual, everyone gave off great vibes.    get some locks!   was totally blown away that not only did the dorms not have locks, but there was no locker option. very unnerving to go to outl all day and have to cross fingers your belongings would be there/untampered with when returning at night.      luckily everyone was great and there were no issues,  with the amount of traffic coming through it only takes 1 bad seed to spoil it all."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,8,8,6,8,6,"it seems lots has been said both positive and negative about this place.  let's start with positive- some staff were very helpful and assisted when an issue arose. pool was inviting. cool old house other guests are good to hang with. breakfast is free and fills a hole. washing is free. the area while appears dodgy locals were really friendly, its safe and close to metro. security on main road too.  neg- some staff not friendly. too few  bathrooms, no locks on rooms."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,amazing place! loved staying here. everyone was extremely friendly and the vibe is rad. 
Singapore,MixedGroup,18-24,2.9,2,2,6,2,4,2,2,"the hostel was pictured and marketed far beyond its actual standards. the security was almost next to nothing, with no lockers and no way to lock our rooms. the fact that the toilets were only in some rooms and were 'shared' meant that people kept entering the rooms with toilets. the floor was so dirty, the towels were not washed properly. "
Russia,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,felt like home. exactly what needed after 12h flight. staff is very friendly and helpful. 
Germany,Female,18-24,5.4,6,4,8,6,6,6,2,hadi was really nice.. 
Netherlands,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10,6,6,10,10,10,8,"great place with awesome staff and guests, lovely (clean) pool. had a really great time here. not very close to downtown la or the beaches, but it is close to a metro train station though!"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"my favourite place, honestly is a home away from home. the staff are incredibly friendly (special shout out to hadi who helped us order pizza) lovely atmosphere and great location, near to train station and and bus stops and local food supermarket close by. definitely will stay again "
Poland,MixedGroup,25-30,5.7,6,2,8,6,8,6,4,"there was no lock in rooms and even in the house.  we smelled a gas from the stove area.  we didn't feel safe.  it smelled like damp and the furnishing wasn't working properly (ie. windows, shower)."
England,Female,25-30,7.7,10,6,10,10,4,10,4,"door to room was unlocked all of the time.  had a problem with ants in the room and the member of staff we brought the issue up to told us it was our fault for having food in the room (there was no food in the room) anf got somebody to just sweep the ants out. other than that single issue, the hostel was amazing"
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,6,6,4,2,4,4,8,"poor management at this hostel, got placed in another property away from the main house and it's facilities. they didn't mention anything about numerical locks on the front door to the property i was placed in so i'm glad i didn't stay out too late and get locked out. just all around an unpleasant but liveable experience. very unorganized process and little to no explanation of things. would not recommend or stay here again."
Canada,Male,25-30,4,4,2,6,2,6,4,4,"the staff were nice enough i guess, but they moved us to another property riddled with problems. friend of mine even for a bad skin infection from the bed. would not recommend to anyone."
Sweden,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, a very pleasant place. with a very laidback staff and an welcoming atmosphere. definitely  good for the backpacker and a younger crowd. access to a nice swimming pool and a relative close distance to the metro that can take you in to downtown was a big plus. 
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,10,4,8,8,6,6,8,"you do get you money's worth here. $35 a night for decent sleeping quarters, walk in showers, they serve breakfast for you, they have a pool, and 10 minutes from train. the downsides were the atmosphere (guests and staff were somewhat reserved and doing their own thing; no events here) and the hostel is open door as in they don't lock the doors. even though it is in a college town, in a family neighborhood, and is claimed to be safe i would have felt more comfortable with it being more secure."
USA,Male,41+,8,10,6,8,8,8,10,6,"fun, fond memories of the old days of radio, an eclectic site, with parking the biggest difficulty.  for the money, it was fantastically good, at $ 22 a night"
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8,10,6,8,8,10,8,6,staff members are kind and the laundry is for free.
Australia,Male,31-40,5.1,4,6,8,4,4,4,6,between hosteworld and anderson estates my booking was completely messed up   i got a email from anderson to let me know that even though i had a booking confirmation i was charged a shared room rate for a private room which is what i booked.. a private room. after many emails i was still not guaranteed the private room even though i was aled to pay a higher price which i was prepared to do. i also called them ten times with no answer. when i arrived there on the day there was no private room ac
Singapore,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean, friendly staff, awesome pool.. if any extra, staff shares their staff meals with you too..thats a bonus! besides that, its evident they try to accomodate you to the best of their resources and capabilities.. to all visiting backpackers, wash your used dishes immediately please. it's counterproductive for the staff who cleans, when you leave dishes in the sink and you complain about roaches etc..  otherwise, all's fine and dandy..."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,6,6,6,10,10,8,"this hostel is perfect for  people who want to meet other travellers and hang out together, very communal atmosphere, everyone is very friendly.  if your are after more luxury / private accomodation this might not be for you, but if you want meet people have some drinks this is your place.  wifi is good in certain spots, very close to train station which takes you straight downtown. and the breakfast is amazing too.  had a great time here 😊. "
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,8,4,6,4,8,6,8,"definitely a solid place to stay. walk to the train wasn’t too long. pool wasn’t very clean (leaves and stuff), but it was also april so 🤷🏼‍♀️.  the dog in the lobby was the best part. she was perfect.  the kitchen was really small in the place i stayed. there was only 1 bathroom for like 15 people.  overall, i probably wouldn’t stay here again but i enjoyed it fine while there. "
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,10,6,8,8,10,8,8,"the best: free breakfast and laundry service, you can swim in the pool, the staff is friendly.    the worst: security, someone stole my personal towel. i know: it's just a towel but could had been a jewel or anything else..."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a nice peaceful stay would definitely go back
Ireland,Female,18-24,8,6,6,8,10,10,8,8,the hostel's in a lovely area very close to the metro line. breakfast every morning was yum! and it has a savage pool ... and lots of great staff (hadi 
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,"they claim about a gap between their system and hostelworld. i booked a 4 bed room, the first night i get a bed at a 10 bed room, and the remaining nights at a 6 bed room. it is not critical, but if you booked something you expect that in return.    the neighborhood it is not the best, but it is okay.     pros:   -breakfast  -pool  -employees really friendly  "
Argentina,Female,18-24,4.9,4,2,6,4,6,4,8,"they don't have any key for the entrance of the property (any person can get into and nobody will ask anything).no lockers anywhere. to get in/out  the common areas you have to cross the room of 6 people (poor them, no privacy at all!). my 1st day they took all my luggage while i wasn't in the building for ""maintenance"" and left in the office. and they charged me $15 more for ""maintenance""  although everything was included in the price. although hostelworld don't mention it, they took it anyways"
USA,Male,41+,7.7,10,4,6,10,8,8,8,"i prefer not to have bulldogs roaming the premises.  i also found one guest to be particularly invasive of my sense of well-being.  (a little too much like the bulldogs.)  the poolhouse based manager was consistently considerate and softspoken in a way that very much served the interest of a customer-facing organization.  i had my own set of planned (and unplanned) events, so i did not network with guests.  good, but be discerning, have a backup plan to avoid 'reality show' nightmare."
USA,Male,41+,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,i was asked to wake up while sleeping and get out of my bed while the room was searched. then i was asked to empty my pockets.   how humiliating
France,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is great. the rooms are nice, the people are nice, the complimentary breakfast is great.  there is a big swim pool. you just can't ask for more than that.      very clean too.     i put 5/5 for security, despite the regretable lack of lockers ( i never understood why some dorm doesn't have lockers. aren't they quite easy and cheap to build from square bookcase + adding little doors and lock ? ) , because it feels extremely safe here.       highly recommand. "
USA,Female,41+,8.3,10,8,8,8,10,8,6,the bathrooms and showers specifically need a good bleaching to get rid of moldy residues. that was pretty gross. was a bit intrusive with people walking through rooms at all hours of the night  when people are trying to sleep. there should be hours when these doors are locked to prevent this from occurring. from 2300-0600 would be good times to enforce this. 
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,4,4,6,6,"in all honesty, i met some truly unworthy people here. while the hostel was okay, i still felt uncomfortable at many moments. the staff weren't but really tentative to the needs of the guests and many times new guests would come to me seeking help with things that the staff should've been taking care of. i would like to say thanks to george, beatrice, mr. tony, barbara, abel and jesus for their great service and friendship during kyng stay! they took the time to actually speak and acknowledge us"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,"the anderson estates provides value for money. for $25 per night i was able to get a free breakfast, free lunch, and access to an outdoor pool. the staff are friendly and nice and the place is tidy."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,8,2,8,8,8,8,6,our ensweet was the only one working for around 20 ppl. they were walking through our room at all hours. some didn't even knock. the breakfast was yummy and staff were nice. 
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,8,4,8,8,6,4,8,"breakfast was absolutely amazing!! more of a halfway house rather than for travellers. other than that, truly enjoyed it!"
India,Male,18-24,4,6,2,6,2,4,4,4,"the images shown here were't even close to reality. we were made to stay in a cottage outside the main mansion. we were assigned an 8 bed room although we had booked a 4 bed room. the reason given to us was that the hostel was overbooked since they do not have any way to limit the number of bookings.place is old, not well maintained, and shady. hostel staff was inefficient and breakfast never started on time. someone was sleeping on the couch in our lounge on one night. no lockers. roms dnt lock"
Malaysia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"great place to stay, made a lot of new friends from all over the world. free breakfast and wifi, and water too whenever you want. also you get to live in a piece of history, and they have really friendly dogs. "
England,Couple,18-24,4,6,2,4,6,4,2,4,"we booked to stay for two weeks, however ended up leaving after three hours. we arrived and were taken to an office where no one seemed to be working, and they didn't seem too interested in checking us in. once we had paid we were told we wouldn't be staying in the mansion in a four bed room, but were taken to the 'overflow' house in an eight bed room. it felt dirty and the atmosphere was very uncomfortable. they said we will get a refund, i have chased them up after two weeks and nothing. "
Australia,Couple,25-30,4.9,6,2,6,6,6,4,4,"this hostel has the potential to be beautiful, but our experience was definitely far from this. the room smelt unpleasant and was not clean. there was mould on the bathroom floor and it was never cleaned during the day. the rooms smelt of weed and had no security, lockers or anything of the sort. the security was the worst part and we felt uncomfortable leaving our possessions there during the day. the inside of the manor is quite nice. the staff were not very professional or helpful. "
USA,Female,18-24,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"the pictures from this place are very deceiving. when we pulled up to the location, the mansion looked very sketchy and torn-down. the facility was not kept in maintenance. we had to go through the mansion (when i say mansion, just picture a huge house with paint chipping off and creepy people staring at your from their window), to get to the office space. the staff in the office also seemed very sketchy &amp; super weird. we had to go through another room to get to our room which seemed really off."
Italy,Male,31-40,8,10,6,8,8,8,8,8,"felt my belongings were safe, but there are no lockers in the rooms.  metro stop is close-by. staff is cool and keen to help.  bad points:   - difference between hostelworld booking system and on site room allocation (never happened before)  - one of the rooms is kind of a preferred passage by guests of other rooms, and some of the guests used to leave the room door open while smoking next to it    likely to come back - a few improvements (see above) would make this place a ""must go""."
Belgium,Male,31-40,8.6,8,6,10,10,10,8,8,"great atmosphere, i like the location and i have extended my stay."
England,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay,good facilities and lovely people! although still not sure about broccoli for breakfast!!!  but great time had and would definitely stay again!! 😊"
Philippines,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,10,6,the anderson estates was great! it made my first hostel experience the best!! i made so many new friends in my house complex. and they serve breakfast in the morning if you get up early enough to get some;)  
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,4,6,8,8,10,8,6,"very accommodating during a busy weekend in the area. polite staff, youthful atmosphere, always something going on. wouldn't recommend staying extended periods longer than 2 weeks."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,"good place to stay for cheap when visiting or even moving to la. free breakfast, good wifi and close to metro line. would reccomend.  "
Italy,Female,18-24,3.7,2,2,2,6,8,4,2,"my only night at the hostel was just traumatizing. my dorm was outside the main property and, unlike it (where the normal backpackers like me were), it was populated by over 50years-old men who actually lived there permanently.  toilets and kitchen were dirty, messy and insalubrious. the whole hostel constantly smelled like weed.  i  left after the first night, mainly because i felt totally unsafe, and asked for a refund which fortunately was done.   breakfast is good and the staff is very kind."
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is more than just a building. the vibe is chilled and super friendly. amazing (free) hot breakfast and coffee every morning. people want to be there and hang out. i loved having breakfast in the garden, sat chatting with people from all over the world, sharing stories and making plans. the staff are all down-to-earth, great people who are up for a laugh too! this will definitely be my accommodation on my next visit to la, for sure! my only problem was a lack of corkscrew! ha! "
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,3.4,2,2,4,2,4,4,6,"the attendant took me on a car chase trying to find an under-aged girl who was supposed to stay there but rose his ""suspicious teen runawa"" flag. its late, its dark, im in his vehicle. he said he needed to drive me over a half a mile to the house id be staying in away from my friend and our car. no house keys. nowhere to lock up my belongings. unsafe doesnt even begin to describe it. i chose not to stay, got a partial refund. that night, 3 blocks away there was a gun fight and people were shot. "
SouthAfrica,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,it is a great place. i loved every moment of it. will definately go there again.
England,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,amazing value for money - the staff were gr8 espec hattie and barney. the piano was gr8 addition too and the breakfast was possibly the best ive ever had. 
England,Female,25-30,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,6,"interesting place, most of the staff was great very helpful and easy going, some were a little selfish when it came to making noise... also a lot of the guests were very inconsiderate of other guest being rude or loud in the bedrooms or blow drying hair in commen areas etc. staff could of done more to help make guests be more considerate, breakfast was lovely just sometimes started late, ants problems, lots of non travelers just hanging out which is cool i guess overall ok experience good value "
England,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,"pro: location was ideal, right by the metro line which can take you pretty much anywhere. clean enough and breakfast was okay.  con: no house lock or lockers."
Egypt,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,"i really liked staying there; especially, i spent time with jazzey (the nice pitbull)... staff are really nice and friendly... you can meet people almost from allover the world... i did not like that there is no lockers although everything is safe. i had my laptop, and it was in my room most of the time, but if you have the option, do not bring it.    the breakfast was pretty nice, and they offer coffee and tea most of the day. there is a pool and you can use it anytime before 11pm."
England,Female,25-30,6,6,2,8,6,8,6,6,"positives  - lovely staff  - pool  - free breakfast  - very flexible if you want a longer stay  negatives   - one morning i got up at 8 just to go to the bathroom and came back to find my bed had been stripped. i was staying another night so couldn't understand the reason for this. the sheets weren't replaced for another couple of hours. also they took my pillowcase which i take on my travels.  - the room is cramped with beds, there were 11 beds in my room and 4 plug sockets.   - wifi not great"
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,8,4,8,6,8,2,2,"the property is unable to be locked, has no security and no lockers for valuables. there are people who live at the ""hostel"" who leave everything a mess. from having their belongings all over the dorm room, to not washing dishes after they cook or eat and leaving the shared bathrooms messy.  we were driven 3 blocks from the main house to our ""hostel"", you have to walk back and forth for breakfast or use of computers or pool. people who live there have 0 regard for guests sleeping or anything els"
Germany,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"when you arrive you first have to change the location to another a few streets away. but the breakfast is in the first one. so you have to move. the hostel is dirty and the kitchen/living room is combined to the bedroom&gt; might get loud in the middle of the night, whether the others want to cook (as they did when we've been there).  "
Turkey,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was great. i thin one of the best place at la. the staffs and boss was very friendly. i like a lot
Australia,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"couldn't recommend this place more! it's cheap, awesome free breaky, so close to the metro and the staff are incredible. they accommodated us moving locations just so we could be closer to the pool and had so much info on everything la. if we are ever back in la this is where we will be! "
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,awesome place to stay
Malaysia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,"special stay at this hostel. it's a mansion turned hostel managed by a group of cool people. mr anderson and the staffs are very helpful and friendly. location is not exactly town-centered but not far from the town (esp with car) about 10 mins walk to the nearest metro station, which are about 4-5 stations from the downtown. not very secured as compared to other hostel because there's no lock for the main gate / door. neighbourhood is residential area so it's quite safe."
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,6,10,10,4,i enjoyed my stay here and loved the breakfast.  i would of gave it a higher rating if the bathroom in my room were cleaner.  also my bed got infected with ants on my last day there.  if you could please clean the room and spray bug spray on the edges of the wall.
Israel,Female,25-30,6.3,8,6,4,8,6,6,6,"people in the hostel tend to do a lot of noise at nights, they don&amp;#39;t really keep it quite at 11pm as they say. the rooms are not that clean, the floor was pretty dusty.  it&amp;#39;s not in a center location, but you have a metro station within 10 minutes walk. it&amp;#39;s not close to restaurants or places to go out at night. but it&amp;#39;s a good area, lots of big houses, no people on the streets.  brakefast was nice, crew was nice too.  i guess it&amp;#39;s a good value for your money."
England,Female,18-24,4.6,4,2,8,4,4,8,2,this is false advertisement. there are no private rooms for 4 people available and the staff stated that this was hostel worlds fault not theirs (doubt it). the place was filthy. the staff were not helpful unless you spoke to mr.anderson.  there was no locks! it was close to the public transport but not worth it! i would not recommend this place at all!!
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,6,8,10,10,10,8,provides awesome breakfast! staff is awesome and so friendly!! my group got upgraded for free to a private room for the entire weekend! very fun and comfortable environment. totally recommend!
Turkey,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,"unlike the reviews on the web, security was not an issue. the environment is friendly and the staff is nice"
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,4.9,8,2,6,6,2,8,2,"at first, our first impressions of the hostel were positive. our welcome to the hostel was very warm - the staff were very professional and relaxed, and the process of checking in was very simple. location is okay.    as our weekend continued, our experience worsened. security is atrocious (no lockers at all). miscommunication with the staff led to one of the guys in our group to lose his bed in the middle of the night.     we wouldn't recommend this hostel to any traveler."
Germany,Male,31-40,8.6,10,4,8,10,8,10,10,"this is a very unique hostel. the location is very conveniently located close to a metro station. guests and staff were cool and the breakfast is free, but if you plan to stay longer, you will soon be bored by the same breakfast every day. but the value for money is unbeatable for the dorm beds. my only concern would be that theoretically everybody could walk in anytime, since the doors are open all the time and there is no possibility to lock up your stuff. "
Hungary,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,8,10,10,10,8,"awesome hostel, great atmosphere and helpful staff, the only thing thats kinda strange is they dont have lockers. but overall, i reccomend it."
USA,Female,18-24,2.9,2,2,2,2,6,4,2,awful. no lockers no security. far away from anything interesting in a horrible area. in a run down old home. 
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,4.6,6,4,6,4,6,4,2,"very poor security, our doors didn't lock. some sleeping areas are in the open and there's nowhere to lock your things. the place was not the cleanest. for people who are not familiar with la the area may be a bit concerning."
England,Female,18-24,7.1,10,2,8,10,6,8,6,"on a budget it is a great place to stay, however the security is lacking a lot, do not leave any valuables as during our 4 day stay there were two cases of stealing, the breakfast is great value for money and the pool is a bonus. "
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i was in california to drop my daughter off at college.  i stayed here.  slept well after my 22-hr drive, and loved the place! other guests were quite civil, and the boss - mr anderson was a courteous, level-headed, and excellent host. yes, i would love to visit again, soon!"
Wales,Female,25-30,3.4,4,2,4,6,4,2,2,felt unsafe with no security. anyone could walk into the hostel and the rooms. the top bunks had no ladder to get on top. the room wasn&amp;#39;t clean. the mattresses had holes in them and wasn&amp;#39;t clean 
Ireland,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"really nice place,never had any problems with the room and breakfast was really nice too"
Croatia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,8,10,8,10,10,"it was great hostel after my nightmare in camelot inn. sam, the owner is a great guy."
Colombia,Female,31-40,6.3,8,6,8,6,4,6,6,it&amp;#39;s ok for the price you pay there. i only recommend it if you don&amp;#39;t have any other option.
Germany,Female,18-24,6,4,4,8,6,8,8,4,there was a communication problem since we had booked a private room and were expecting privacy since we thought we paid more than we would have for a shared room. in the end we got a room for two nights which we were able to lock but it took a while. then we had to move into another room. the bathroom that came with that room had not been cleaned and there were used toiletries and towels in there. please check with the owner which rooms are available and whether the they match the offer on hw.c
Belgium,Male,18-24,5.4,6,2,6,4,8,8,4,"location is okay given how big la is, staff were helpful and friendly enough and there was breakfast every morning (which was not the best and exactly the same every day). hoewever, security was atrocious. no locks on outside doors or room doors, and people who did have a private room with a lock on the door were forbidden from locking it! no lockers that i saw either, so you&amp;#39;re constantly considering that any random stranger could walk into your room and steal your stuff."
India,AllMaleGroup,25-30,4,6,2,6,4,4,4,2,"not at all like the pictures on display. terrible beds, poor management (alloted one bed to multiple people) only decent part was breakfast. avoid at all cost. "
USA,Male,18-24,5.7,8,8,4,6,4,6,4,"the location, although is a quite and residential area, is pretty far from the main places of interest in la (hollywood, beverly hills and santa monica). you can arrive by public transport (10 min walking form expo/western station), but it is not a hostel i might recommend for doing tourism in la area for a few days, unless you have a car (but, i remind you, la traffic can be horrible).  the ambient was chill. cool and youth staff. the pool is probably the best of the hostel. "
Thailand,Female,18-24,7.4,10,6,8,8,10,6,4,the breakfast is awesome and it&amp;#39;s around 10 mins walk to metro ( a bit scary to walk at night ) . some of the staffs are very nice and fun to talk too. the room i stayed though was pretty dirty but all the other rooms were so clean and i stayed on the 2nd floor with only one bathroom in the other room so sometimes i couldn&amp;#39;t use it so i have to walk to the pool just to use the bathroom but i enjoyed the stay. it&amp;#39;s really affordable and worth it. + main gate was never locked but it&amp;#39;s safe. 
Colombia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have had my best time there and my vacation in cali was fab  the place is nice and the people too , i hope come back.soon "
England,MixedGroup,18-24,7.1,10,2,6,8,10,8,6,good facilities and great breakfast but little security with doors being open onto the main street and no lockers and keys for rooms. everyone was friendly and helpful and me and my friends enjoyed our stay here. metro was close enough to hostel to get around la easily and parking on the road was fine as well. films in the evening with snacks were offered as well. good for price but don't have high expectations. although free breakfast was amazing!
England,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,the people who run and work in the hostel are so nice and everyone who stays there is so friendly. the free breakfast you get every morning is amazing especially the waffles i need that recipe!! you can easily get to the tram which takes you into downtown and it&amp;#39;s a couple of stops from lots of museums. i would defiantly stay here again 
England,MixedGroup,18-24,6.9,8,4,8,6,8,8,6,good for price but lacking in security for personal belongings. other guests had things stolen from.bags whilst here.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,pretty good place. close to the metro. nice swimming pool. great breakfast. free towels. free bottle water. free washing machine. amazing !!! i will stay here again when i come back to los angeles. 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the cottage is the main property with the pool, free breakfast, big screen, and dj. the ensuite is three blocks away, consisting of four buildings, but was unfortunately under construction during my stay, which started at 8am. there was also an ant infestation, mainly in the kitchen, and only 1/4 stove tops worked. and parking was competitive/limited.    everything else was great! two miles from shopping strips, grocery, and clothing stores. can see the hollywood sign from the ensuite!"
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best accommodation i&amp;#39;ve visited lately :) great staff, wicked pad, pretty much unreal. i will recommend to friends. thanks !!"
Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"a wonderful, old, historic, very nice place to stay.  mr eddie anderson is a wonderful man.  just one small thing bothered me ...... rooms cannot lock.  although it is very safe. otherwise, i will sure stay there again.  and i give them 100%.  "
Germany,Male,18-24,4.9,2,2,6,2,8,6,8,"there is no security at this hostel at all! neither the house, nor the room, nor the bath room could be locked and there were no lockers available to rent. that the hostel is in fact a mansion with a pool does not compensate this. location is ok for la with a metro stop nearby but staying in that neighbourhood with no security was uncomfortable. everything usually looked clean, but it would be great if shelves and cupboards were dusted regularly, so that they could actually be used for storage."
Canada,Male,18-24,4.9,4,2,4,4,6,6,8,"anderson estates is not a hostel in the typical sense. there is the main mansion where the pool/yard is located. as well, mr. anderson owns several houses in the area where bunk beds have been set up. some of the beds are set up in bedrooms, but bunk beds are also set up in open areas with zero privacy.    there is absolutely zero security! the house and bedroom could not be locked, and there were no storage lockers for your items. considering the sketchy neighborhood, this is very worrying."
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.6,8,2,8,6,6,8,8,"the free breakfast was great always left full. location is a good as you&amp;#39;re going to get in la, close to the metro line and close to a big supermarket. the staff didn&amp;#39;t really help or hinder it seemed like it was run by a group of mates rather than a actual staff. best price you&amp;#39;re going to get in la "
China,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everyone is so friendly! great place to meet other travellers. nicely prepared free breakfast! the location is convenient for tourist attractions in different directions. i would definitely recommend this place.
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8,8,6,6,8,10,10,8,it was good :) 
Switzerland,Male,25-30,8,10,4,6,8,10,10,8,"+extremly nice spot with swimming pool!  +best place to meet amazing people from all horizons  +breakfast is amazing  +mr. anderson and his team are really nice, and offer a lot of extras (cutting gopro movies service!)    -secondary houses very poorly is"
England,Male,18-24,5.1,6,4,6,6,2,4,8,"one of the strangest hostels i've ever stayed at. part hostel - part construction site where the mansion owner provides free accomodation for those working on his house. these individuals drink most nights and can be very loud and abusive. wouldn't reccomend staying here, but it is fairly close to the expo/western metro station. "
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,it was good overall but the first day they put me to sleep at the living room on a horrible air mattress and the wi-fi doesn&amp;#39;t work very well.
Israel,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i have chosen it because it was quite cheap, but when i came i felt like a king :)  you have pool, great breakfast, kitchen, wifi, showers, nice staff and 2 cute dogs. what do you need more? "
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,8,2,8,10,8,8,6,"we booked two gender specific dorm rooms so were pleasantly surprised when we ended up in a private dorm.  we were in one of the secondary houses (not the main mansion). beds were comfy and had a shared ensuite, although other people accessed it via our room. there was next to no security! door to house was never locked and normally open, couldn&amp;#39;t lock our bedroom door from the outside and there were no lockers. breakfast at the mansion house was nice and there was a pool use. near metro stop"
Croatia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"nice place with a pool, great staff, good price, great breakfast!"
SouthKorea,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,3.7,4,2,2,4,6,4,4,"they are still under construction.   so thay made noisy sound every morning.   there is no 24hrs front desk service.   the first day, we got the temperory room that there is no privacy as well as many people passed by our room to get their room and bathroom.  second day, there is no ladder on our bed going up. even if i asked staff already, thay didnt fix.  there are some aunts in my bed and i saw a cockroach bathroom.   i felt scary near hostel. the price was cheap but not wealthy. "
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,6,8,10,8,8,10,"i have stayed in hostels all over the world . i can truthfully say this is one of the best places i have stayed and certainly one of the best values . a clean room, clean bathroom, excellent wi-fi, a good breakfast, a customer useable computer and general atmosphere makes this one of the best deals you will find in los angeles ever . i highly recommend this hostel and certainly plan to stay there again when i am passing through los angeles again.l.p."
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,10,8,6,8,8,6,8,"probably the cheapest place to stay in la. free laundry and breakfast in the morning! definitely a college party-type atmosphere, so prepare for that, especially if staying in a dorm room. staff (and other guests) could be more considerate (what's with continually leaving the door to the living room wide open and blasting the tv at all hours, especially when people are trying to sleep???). mr. anderson himself is a great guy. location isn't so good—near usc—but that's the nature of la."
England,Male,18-24,8.3,10,6,8,10,10,8,6,"free breakfast, swimming pool and a large garden area are all bonuses on top of a comfortable hostel close to a metro station. the beds are comfortable and the bathroom areas are clean. however the kitchen area is gross towards the end of the day and there are no lockers or even locks on the bedroom doors. also the front door is left open 24/7 so theoretically anyone could walk in. luckily i had no problems with my things while i was there though."
USA,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"i made a good choice to stay here.  to think i paid $20 to stay in a mansion, where hollywood stars used to visit, including bob hope and marilyn monroe according to mr anderson.  great breakfast, much better than all the other hostels i have stayed in the us.  the staff was excellent.   facilities include a large pool which i hope to use next time if the weather is warmer.  "
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,8,10,10,10,"the stay here was awesome, although i think people, especially other females, need to know to be a little careful in the area. i had quite a few people around la tell me to be careful in the area and not keep my phone out while walking around because people have been known to swipe them.   other than that i had no problems. laid back with a pool, 10 min walk from the train and buses, takes about an hour to get to most places which is common when taking transportation anywhere in la."
USA,Female,18-24,3.7,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,worst hostel ever. i was coming from out of town for work and knew id have a late check in. called 2 numbers more than 4 times with no answer or voicemail to leave message. emailed to ask about the late check in and they said it was fine. i got there and no one was there to check me in. i stayed for three days without checking in. there are no locks on any doors. communication is absolutely terrible &amp; none of the staff know whats going on and are unable to help even when they try. complete mess 
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,10,6,8,"i stayed in the private room so security wasn&amp;#39;t a problem. but the stay was very nice. wifi runs decently, the walk to the metro is about 15 minutes though so get ready for that. overall it was a good stay, i didn&amp;#39;t have the free breakfast, but i know they have it so thats also a plus."
Belgium,MixedGroup,31-40,5.4,6,2,4,8,6,6,6,"very strange place. didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable at all. booked for 3 nights but only stayed 2 because i felt unsafe. no locks on the front door. no lockers in the rooms. the second night a really creepy man came into our room around 10.30pm. the staff said it was too late to check him in and just let him into our room without knowing who he was. i didn&amp;#39;t want to stay in the same room as he, and luckily the staff did understand and asked him to leave. breakfast is ok.wifi ok.close to public transport"
England,Male,25-30,7.7,10,4,6,10,8,10,6,"the anderson estates is definitely one of the stranger hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed at however it certainly has a lot of positives, the staff are really helpful, i met great people there, free breakfast and laundry and you even have a swimming pool and gym equipment. negatives are i didn&amp;#39;t feel security was very tight, it was like anyone could come and go whenever plus the location isn&amp;#39;t central at all although near a metro stop. would still recommend as it is the cheapest place in l.a"
USA,Female,31-40,6.6,8,6,4,8,8,8,4,not bad for the price. has a pool &amp; the people are friendly. but people need to learn to knock on your door not just bust in on you. not the best location for site seeing. most of the time you&amp;#39;ll need to call a cab or use uber/lyft. but overall it was a good experience. i&amp;#39;d stay again.  bostonbyrd
USA,Female,18-24,5.7,6,2,10,6,6,2,8,i was doing laundry when i went to check on it someone was in the process of taking it out.
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10 plus if you or anyone you know needs a reliable place for what ever reason i highly recommend staying there very trust worthy.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.3,10,4,8,10,8,10,8,"don't let the number decide your trip - the value of this place far outweighed the issues i did have with this place. if i was ever staying in la again i would hands down stay here every time. but: security is lacking. no keys, no lockers. bring a cable/bag lock! the staff are actually great but management is a bit weird... it feels like there's no permanent workers so no one really knows some things  overall its the best hostel for your money in la, but definitely needs a bit more work!"
Argentina,Male,31-40,6.6,6,6,6,8,6,6,8,"nice place, but is not a mansion, the rooms are in a little house near to the swimming pool. the staff was volunteers from france very bad face, the breakfast is bad food, the only good is wafles but only 1 for person.   the please doesnt have lockers, and everybody pass for your room.  the doors doesnt have lock.  also the staff put the tv in the night too high.    the neighbourhood is nice and you have the metro close.

Zimbabwe,Male,31-40,6.3,8,6,6,8,4,8,4,beautiful  structure but not very clean.dust below beds.  reception staff not   very  friendly      
USA,Female,41+,6.6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,this is my first experience with a hostel. i&amp;#39;ve met some nice and interesting people at anderson estates. i believe there should be more involvement on a managerial level. the breakfast is always great. there is prompt service if any needs arise. i have found it humbling and appreciated the home.
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,"it&amp;#39;s a great place to stay: free breakfast, friendly staff, a pool and very clean rooms. i travel a lot even though i am los angeles based here. it&amp;#39;s comforting to know that i have a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; to stay at that is not only affordable, it&amp;#39;s a great to be in. i enjoy the place and appreciate the location where i can drive to work within a reasonable distance.  if i have any concerns, joanne will take care of it. i know that i am listened to and valued as a guest. i stay here often. thank you!"
England,Female,18-24,8,10,6,8,8,10,6,8,"this is a nice hostel, with great friendly staff. the only downside is that as a solo traveller it is harder to meet people there. "
Denmark,Male,18-24,7.7,10,6,6,10,6,8,8,"the property in itself is extraordinary, and the amenities are very good and free. however the staff could be a bit unorganized, and they do not have lockers in the rooms.   also the location isn&amp;#39;t exactly central, but it is however close to a metro station.   parking is nice as well.   i enjoyed my stay there, and would recommend. "
USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,the people were awesome and so was the breakfast! it&amp;#39;s hard to tell who&amp;#39;s on the staff and who isn&amp;#39;t but if you ask around you can always get help from a friendly staff member. if you get drunk with the french people you&amp;#39;ll probably end up getting thrown into the pool... all in good fun! this place was great!
Australia,Female,31-40,6.6,8,6,6,6,8,4,8,"bit of a strange vibe, and it's very much in the suburbs. close to train line though and the neighbourhood is alright. facilities made available to dorm customers are pretty average - i kind of felt like i was intruding tbh, though people were all nice, it's less travellers and more people in between houses or moving to la that seem to stay in the dorms. nice looking pool, comfy beds and everything cleaned daily, can't comment on the breakfast because i'm vegan but people seemed to enjoy it."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,2.9,2,2,4,4,2,2,4,the place looked dark and uninviting.  as we walked the facility we felt unsafe and concerned about how easy it was for people to come in and out of the property.      we expected to see travelers like ourselfs but instead we saw a lot of young people just hanging around and it looked like they had been living there for a while.  the place looked like a college dorm after a house party.      we want our deposit back because what was been advertised is not what we witnessed.      
Netherlands,Male,18-24,6.9,8,2,6,8,8,8,8,"the anderson estates hostel is a beautiful place to visit.     when i arrived i wasnt enable to check in, but some employees (there are volunteers from workaway) did help me to get a bed. everybody was telling me that the breakfast is good, but im used to do a dutch breakfast.. so it wasnt good for me. it is very sweet and i didnt like the way they serve breakfast. the location is good, like everything in the us... you have to travel a long distance. after all its a good and &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; hostel.    "
USA,Male,31-40,4.6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,"it was confusing trying to utilize this hostel - bathrooms were not clearly marked, one of the pool showers was lacking a shower curtain."
CzechRepublic,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,10,10,8,8,"i was really happy with my stay at the anderson estates, you have everything what you need. nice room, quiet and great breakfast. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wow! one of the best hostels in the world! it's five times larger than most hostels, with many living rooms and houses and hangout places, gym equipments, free self-laundry, two kitchens for guests, tvs, and a playstation. our 8 bunk-beds room and private bathroom is cleaned daily. i had a free delicious breakfast buffet every morning while watching tv in a big dining room in front of a beautiful swimming pool. the staff is very nice and friendly. highest luxury for lowest cost! need i say more?"
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"when i got there every one was really nice. i stayed in the 9-bed mixed dorm for two weeks, and even had the room to myself a few nights. there's two huge houses, lots of couches, very comfortable. right next to the metro train, which was very convenient. the place was so big that it had 3 different wifi passwords, but they all had strong signals, and i was  streaming all the european soccer games to my phone no problem. they leave the coffee and tea out all day, and the free breakfast was great"
Denmark,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,all in all a nice hostel.. only thing is that its a bit fare away from everything..
Australia,Male,41+,8,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,very good

USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"when you think of a hostel, you think of a happy, welcoming, relaxing, affordable experience. well this place did that for me, i have been to so many hostels in my life and never one like this. i've seen the reviews on here, and some have said the neighborhood is bad and others have said the staff is mean. since i hwvhwve been here i have been given the upmost respect by every single individual on the facilities from the staff to the guests."
England,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,10,8,"amazing loved my stay the dog is funny , staff are great and friendly i stayed in the 9 bed mix dorm and at some points it was all to myself, you have to stay here there's a pool and the breakfast well hot bacon sausage and egg with waffles covered in chocolate cream and strawberries .... it's very much a hidden gem ... oh did i not mention the price yet !  i payed $20/£14 and stayed for 9 nights cheap supermarket 10 min stroll ... why are you still reading this ... book up don't be a fool! ☺️"

Brazil,Couple,18-24,3.1,6,2,2,6,2,2,2,this is not a hostel. no lockers and doors are open all day and night. near the most dangerous district of la. unprepared staff. many guests/residents trying to get jobs in la. room with dirty carpet. worsened my allergy. good breakfast.
USA,Female,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"they told me the site was faked and stole my money , they kicked out me and insulted me , very impolite"
Denmark,Female,18-24,5.1,6,4,8,8,2,4,4,the internet didn't match with the booking they made on their own. we booked for 10 night but couldn't get more than 2. they kicked people out same day as us because a big groupe were the day after. we waited for one and a half hour on the receive they promised me the day before.   we haven't no stairs to our bed and than have to climb up every night.   the lock on the restroom didn't work and the shower was grose.     the breakfast in the morning was excellent - so good!!
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,"it was more of a home for people wanting to move to la. staff weren't very helpful with tourist attractions or pu lic transport knowledge. had to figure it out on my own. breakfast was good, though self service would've been quicker"

France,Couple,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"very great place! near from the city center, you sleep inside a big american house : big rooms, kitchen, laundry (also for free!), a rest room (sofa, tv), swimming pool in the garden, two clean bathrooms for dormitory. the mattress in dormitory are comfortable. the breakfast is included (egg, bacon, pankake, strawberry, coffe, orange juice,...). great for backpackers. the owner can offer you a job inside the guesthouse so that you can stay longer witthout paying your room!"
England,Male,18-24,6,8,2,2,8,8,6,8,cheap and cheerful but in a very dodgy area. easy access to the metro though 
Denmark,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,8,8,"lovely place, great breakfast included and really nice staff. would definetely recommend it to others. and the price is soooo good!"
USA,Male,31-40,2.3,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,"make no mistake... this is not a hostel! 1) the west adams district of l.a. is a crime-ridden, drug-infested ghetto, where every house has bars on the windows and the nearest bus stop is 2km away. 2) there are no lockers, and the bunk beds are crammed less than a meter between each other. 3) god knows what property you'll be placed in. the tiny house i stayed at had 22 beds and only one bathroom. 4) forget about meeting tourists. most everyone are actor wanna-be's or indigent locals."
USA,Male,31-40,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"i missed my flight from berlin to lax, so sadly, i'm unable to leave a cogent review. but i would like to think they are good people. this is why i'm forced to leave an ""average"" report, having no other idea of what to suggest."
Brazil,Male,18-24,6.9,8,6,6,8,8,8,4,"the room that i was have just 2 beds with a bathroom, and all of my floor could use the bathroom. however, i didn't like the idea of all the floor use the bathroom, because i was with my friend in the room, and i thought that this bathroom it was just for us. i suggest to do a bathroom for the others rooms or make the bathroom of this room just for the room. also, i didn't like the cleanliness of the bathroom, because we stayed for 5 days, and the bathroom wasn't cleaned any time."
USA,Male,18-24,6,4,6,4,6,6,8,8,"i never received a key that worked for the front door while at the hostel. several nights i was locked out of the building, and had to ask to be let in.     the younger staff from other countries were great -- very nice, and accommodating. some of the older staff seemed a bit curt with guests."

Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,it was great! thanks guys for everything! hope to go again soon.
Norway,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,4,2,2,4,4,"extremly dissapointing. staff ignored me totaly. this is not a backpacker hostel at all, more like a long term housing. would really not recomend to travellers."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,"this was an odd sort of hostel, in that it was segregated into a few different houses. the ""office"" was a house across the road from the main building, and often there wasn't anyone there to ask questions. they also don't provide any maps or visitor guids or tourist info.   i had to ask about 3 times to have clean sheets put on the bed, the management doesn't seem very well structured.  otherwise it was a very nice place to stay."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,8,6,"i have been staying at two different locations, the rochester house is under going some upgrades and i look forward to seeing the place when their finished. the second house is very nice and the other people staying here are friendly and considerate of the other guests. i am moving to another one of the many other properties that they own and if its as nice as the other two i've been in then i look forward to staying there.  its nice to know that they have so many different locations."
France,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,6,8,2,6,8,8,8,"the hostel is nice, we stayed in a 6 beds room, the room was really big but the bathroom was in another room (occupied, so it was awkward). but people were nice.   and the location was awful too far from everything, 30 minutes by taxi and more than 1 hour by public transportation."
Israel,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,10,8,very good hostel and very kind staff!!!  see and you won't be disappoint.
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,10,8,8,8,6,8,6,"it's a really nice place. it's a little bit caotic, but there are just on the beginning. if there are done the place is probably really nice. the breakfast is the best! just awesome!"
Brazil,Male,18-24,5.1,6,2,4,6,8,6,4,"there is no brackfast in correct time, i booked a room with 4 beds but when i arrived there the room had 8 beds, local reform. gates open 24 hours and there is no security."
England,Female,18-24,6,8,2,10,6,6,4,6,"they lied about their facilities. first of all there wasn't 3 meals a day. they place is still under going it's refurbishment so there is no pool nor is the rooms as they looked in the pictures (now they have been updated) the kitchen was a mess, nothing was there for you to use.     management was rarely home. was fed up answering the door to strangers wanting to speak to the  . the front door wasn't locked at night. extremely unsafe especially in jefferson, a rough area."
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this hostel was nothing like advertised on the website, the actual hotel was being refurbished so we were directed to a grubby little house nearby which didn't have pillows or breakfast and was generally very run down. we were then told there was aistake in the booking process and we actually had to pay four times the advertised price! needless to say we left quickly and found somewhere else. do not stay here."
France,Male,25-30,4,4,6,2,4,4,4,4,"i booked this hostel for the price, but when we check-in they told us they was a mistake with the price and it sould be double price , so we stayed 1 night and then moved downtown where it was same price ."
England,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,bed bugs! the hostel is nice enough but when you pay $40 bloody dollars for 1 night (the most i’ve ever spent on a hostel and i’ve travelled the world over) . but...... no..... great
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,8,10,10,lovely place to stay indeed. definitely would return.
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a great time the staff was amazing and super kind ill definitely go back sometime thank you so much guys 
USA,Female,31-40,4,2,4,4,6,6,4,2,i would avoid this hostel.
England,Female,25-30,8,6,6,10,6,10,8,10,"podshare is interesting. the bed is super comfy and i like the pod space you have to yourself. the working space is a bit annoying. it is quiet time 10pm-10am - which isn't good if you have time difference to your work country and the coffee was not easy to make so i found myself out in coffee shops a lot. the showers were good quality, clean and warm. the toilets were tiny. there are lockers and you can get a lock. you will meet very interesting people and have a great time and an amazing sleep"
Chile,Male,31-40,8,6,8,6,8,10,8,10,"the hostel is completely different to what i've experienced so far. that's not to say it isn't a great place, because it can get really cool. the location is fine, relatively close to union station, but it can be far away from attractions like west hollywood. do not expect the typical bagel-with-something kind of breakfast, but there are cereals, milk, and other stuff in the kitchen. elvina, the owner, was super cool and took the guests to fun halloween activities, she puts a lot of love in it."
Canada,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,"location is good and close to union station but it's very noise cuz it's close to road, you can hear people screaming, police car warning sound (very loud), car horn, busy traffic noise.  the lady owner a little rude sometime, she doesn't provide enough information how to unlock the door at night, you have to ask and she didn't seem happy to let you know the password. free breakfast but it's only the cornflake or stuff like that. toilet stall is very small, knee hit the stall door.  "
Japan,Female,25-30,8.9,6,8,8,10,10,10,10,ちょっと変わった感じで、最初は戸惑いましたが、居心地よかったです。夜はとても静かでゆっくり休めました。交通機関へのアクセスが少し遠く、周辺の人通りがないため、少し警戒していましたが、特に危ないことはありませんでした。
Croatia,MixedGroup,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,a bit weird on first. but really great place! recommending :)))
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,simply sublime. staff were unrivalled along my travels for the most kind people i met. would stay again and again
USA,Male,41+,7.1,10,6,6,6,10,6,6,this is one of the better prices in town it's a place to sleep well. it's not all that bad just the toilet and shower spaces were a tight fit. also the refrigerator fresh water dispenser was very inefficient trickling slowly.  other than those little inconveniences it was a nice stay.
USA,Male,41+,5.1,6,2,4,6,6,6,6,no security at night n alley u walk thru not that well lit parking is poor on street n bums walking around
England,Male,18-24,8.3,6,6,6,10,10,10,10,lovely layout and very clean.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my encounters have been brief, needed a consistent solution for work a few days a week. have travelled overseas often and decided to give this a shot. i usually arrive later in the evening so consider this a night shift review. overall this location is always amazing, clean, quite, and has overall a great vibe to it. everyone has always been friendly no matter their background, ect. people are respectful of your pod and belongings; at night it is quite, definitely recommended. fantastic job!"
Australia,Female,25-30,7.1,6,10,6,6,8,6,8,"didnt really love this place too much - it was chosen only for convenience. it isn't in a happening area, there wasn't much atmosphere and the pods are literally all open. i get the idea and think it's great however a small half curtain just to hide the light of others in the night would be really useful. "
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"podshare for sure was the best hostel i have been. different from others hostel, you have your own pod which has a t.v., a lamp, a thing where you can hold your tower a d place your stuffs. i felt very comfortable inside the pot."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place, great location. i loved having so much space and not being cramped into a normal bunk bed. free tea and coffe which was nice. only downside i thought was the bathrooms could of been a bit bigger and the doors less see through! "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,brilliant and lovely staff
England,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,4,10,6,6,"really wonderful staff and location, but lack of atmosphere and the loos and showers are too small and dingy.  great area, don't be afraid to explore. "
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,10,"pleasant and clean, but not super social and in a bit of a removed location. "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"everything i hoped it would be an more. podshare has a great vibe and its layout really gets people mingling. facilities are great for what you're paying. i'm a neat freak so i was most worried about it being dirty, it's clean! for people who need their sleep lights out and noise kept to a minimum is enforced around 10-11pm each night. overall a really fun but respectable environment. made some lifelong friends. it won't be my last time at podshare!"
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,loved being walking distance from litle tokyo! veronica is super awesome and friendly!
Malaysia,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,it's a nice hostel with pleasant smell of pine wood. the reception mr matel is awesome and very polite and helpful. place is clean and well kept. the showers and toilets are super snug though and ear plugs will help sleep better as the traffic can be noisy at night. beds are super comfortable and the pod concept provides more personality to the experience. overall a unique and pleasant experience. loved it!!
Canada,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,6,8,2,6,8,"overall had a decent stay, when i arrived it took forever to find the hostel. had the tiniest podshare sign i walkedaround for about an hour. the staff when i first arrived was super quiet but did his job, he left then there was a young girl that i didn't even know was the staff. she was out partying with everyone so much that i assumed she was staying in the hostel herself. she barely even talked to me and was very unprofessional. the hostel itself was very nice. wouldn't stay again."
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,couldn't put a foot wrong. great place and love the fact that it's located in the arts district. slowly becoming part of a mini berlin. 
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"so before going i read the reviews and there was a negative one that was quite concerning. after visiting pod share i have to say there were no negatives. the place was awesome, clean and there are no beds close to the bathroom. everything smelled great. excellent location and a fun environment. "
USA,Male,31-40,5.7,4,8,4,4,8,6,6,"it's ok. beats being homeless. pros: seriously the most comfortable beds i've slept on in my travels. plenty of room in the pod, tv, light, and outlet. although one of the pods is without them...makes me wonder why they haven't fixed it. overall a clean comfortable place, reasonable kitchen, rooms to lounge in.  con: no privacy. the pods are nice but could use a curtain. bathroom is a joke. cramped..absurdly cramped, no privacy, no door to living area. thought i would get tetanus in shower."
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,8,6,6,4,6,6,8,"podshare has high-quality facilities for the most part, but there were a number of uncomfortable factors. the bathroom facilities are extremely cramped. my pod was virtually in the middle of the room with zero privacy (the check-in ""desk"" is about three feet away), it had no convenient outlets, and there was no personal locker for valuables. while staff was very friendly, they often weren't around, so the hostel did not feel well run. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"it was a great place to stay, it was a very convenient location, and i appreciated the security measures with the door keypads. it wasn't that hard to find free parking, and the beds and common areas were clean and neat. the only minor complaint i had was that the bathroom stalls were quite tiny, so if you sit on the toilet, your legs are pressed against the door. other than that, it was a very minor thing that didn't detract from my overall stay. really, it can't be beat for its price."
Germany,Couple,18-24,2.6,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,"i had the only bed without shelf, light, plug, tv but paid full price. no breakfast although stated otherwise and paid for. staff shrugged it off and said only management can do sth. management supposedly had no time. reception, kitchen, bath, lounge and beds all in one room. toilets had no real doors, could hear and smell people pooping from our beds. nasty showers, loud street. been to many hostels, but this place has the worst concept by far. false advertising. be warned, avoid this place!"
Australia,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay. i loved the fridge with the ice dispenser! i was in la to work and found great cafes to set up my laptop nearby. organic supermarket 5 minutes away.
Australia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was exactly what i wanted.  private bed space, but shared.  very clean, really comfortable, really good feel, helpful staff.  i really loved getting off the plane and coming straight to a place like this to rest and restore."
Bulgaria,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,4,6,8,8,"the place was clean and the pods were very comfy. each pod comes with its own tv, outlet, shelf, and the whole place has a strong wi-fi signal. the main thing i didn't like about it was the facilities. the bathroom/shower area is very small and tight, shared between all the males/females in the whole place. 3 toilets and 2 showers in one very small room for everybody to use. on top of that, when i tried to take a shower there was no hot water. i waited an hour and it still was cold."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place was clean , comfortable and welcoming . the staff and the other clients were all great ! i will definitely stay here again !  "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"podshare is an interesting idea.   the pods themselves are private from one another, but they are all within the same great room space. it's sort of like having your own treehouse in a giant backyard.   the toilets and showers are cramped, but passable. the kitchen is simple. the upper bunks run warmer than the lowers; grab a fan up in the common area.   the location is absolutely perfect for downtown, and the train station.   i'll stay again, the next time i visit. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,6,8,8,6,8,interesting concept. a kinda work/sleep space. comfy bunks with individual tv and power points. good food in nearby little tokyo. can walk to downtown. 
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,10,4,10,remarkably clean and well-equipped; great location in the arts district &amp; near downtown; elvina was friendly and helpful and had bangin' food recommendations; not much community (&amp; even a little conflict while i was there) but generally very nice people.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,6,8,the staff were nice but it wasn't that much of an inviting vibe. the concept is really cool and looks really cool. although my bed was really comfy and the position of the hostel was great the facilities that i needed like wifi and the tv i was auspost to have didn't work 80% of the time.       positive tho best showers ever 
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very friendly staff, a great experience for my first time staying at a hostel"
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,6,8,10,10,10,great place for solo travelers. everyone is respectful.  the facility is clean and quite. the neighborhood is also very quite and safe.
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"right in the uber hip arts district. very close to little tokyo and dtla. comfortable beds, very clean, very nice hostel-mates and employees. one of the best hostels i've stayed in."
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"this is a perfect spot to meet new people from various places. the hostel was clean and the smell of wood makes you feel at home. the booking process was simple and easy, i recommend purchasing the $1.00 security fee, i had to change reservation dates and it was a very simple process. i really enjoyed the setup! i highly recommend, i would definitely keep podshare in mind next time i visit again. "
China,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,seldom private space
Canada,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,10,6,8,10,"overall place was good, just couldnt find the staff and didnt know who they were. desecent location in a a good part of town so it was pretty safe. the other thing i missed was the email from podshare since it came 40min after the hostelworld confirmation emails. i took off right after i got the confirmation email and wasnt really sure where to go or how to get in when i got there. the podshare email had all the information on where to find the door, key pad number, and wifi. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,bathrooms are tiny - sitting on the toilet my knees were hitting the door which was made of wooden slats so people can hear your farts easily.  but great location in the arts district next to little tokyo and union station
USA,Female,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,6,6,4,10,world tiniest bathroom and toilet. u have no where to get dressed since there is no privacy.
Taiwan,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"hi, this place is amazing. you have full access to the kitchen, and the staff there is super friendly and helpful. the bed, the restroom and the whole area is very clean. it is also very quiet. i slept three nights and it was a great experience. definitely recommended!"
Spain,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,4,8,8,8,10,"i arrived at 10pm and they gave me one of the last beds they had, which didn't have tv or somewhere to charge my phone. all beds should have those facilities because i paid for them, there shouldn't be ""lasts and worst beds"". the restrooms were very small and not private. the location was quite bad, i didn't feel secure outside the hostel. notice that check in is until 11pm, and for them that also means light turned on and music everywhere. staff were really nice."
India,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is an 18 bed hostel with a kitchen and bathrooms that are well provided with toiletries. it is located just a short cab ride from union station (you could walk to if you up for it). the gentleman who checked us in was really helpful. the hostel was really quiet and everyone friendly and well behaved. its a good option for a solo traveller or even a group.  
Singapore,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very clean, safe, spacious, comfortable and instagrammable. staff was extremely helpful and responsive. a little pricier than other hostels but i&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s rather worth it! "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,great place in la downtown!
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i loved staying here! the staff are so friendly, the space is open and very clean, yet you still feel like you have a certain amount of privacy due to the way the beds are constructed. the only thing i could wish to be better would be a little more space in the bathroom stalls (for those of us who are tall and gangly :). great place to stay for a long or short term visit, i highly recommend it."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,an amazing place to stay! the staff make you feel right at home and have great knowledge of the local area that they&amp;#39;re happy to share. the communal areas are great if you&amp;#39;re looking to meet new people from around the globe or if you&amp;#39;re tired each individual pod is quite private. 10/10
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,6,10,"we were very jet lagged when we were at podshare, it was a cool place to explore downtown la from, but as a couple, our three nights were definitely enough time to be spent there as the lack of privacy started to get to us and the trains were very noisy at night! staff were pleasant and happy to help with questions and directions :) "
Australia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,10,6,4,8,"interesting set up for a hostel, but was really happy. only picked it because it was the closest hostel to the hotel that my tour was starting from. beds are really comfy!! wifi bit sketchy on phone but ok on laptop. little difficult to find. staff pretty helpful. facilities are good and clean, but the toilet and shower are really small."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"definitely will come back and stay at this place again! very unique and inspiring experience. the co-living space concept definitely works and it allows for people to create new friendships and make you feel really at home. comfortable, safe and pleasant environment. it feels like you belong to a bigger family unit. amazing experience! love it!!! 👍👍👍"
Wales,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,8,10,"the bed was comfy and clean, the staff were lovely and there was communal food so i didn&amp;#39;t need to worry about finding breakfast. the &amp;#39;pods&amp;#39; are very open and there is nowhere to securely store large pieces of luggage. it felt safe so i didn&amp;#39;t mind but it may bother some people. netflix on our own personal tv was cool but mine had a very very slow connection. "
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely amazing place to stay! what elvina has done to the building is nothing short of brilliant. the pods are fantastic, they&amp;#39;re clean, extremely comfortable, have tv for when you just want to chill out and they don&amp;#39;t make a noise like the conventional bunk beds! i really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to all! emma and gillian were great upon greeting us and showing us round and really made us feel at home! if you&amp;#39;re ever in downtown la there&amp;#39;s only one place to stay- podsh"
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this might be the best hostel i every stayed.    don&amp;#39;t be intimidated by sharing a big room with 14 others, in fact, you have a big bed space and you feel you have all the private space you need!     a trendy approach to hostel environment, forget about those traditional en-suite room with metal bunkbeds, podshare is a completely different experience...    located right next to the art district and little tokyo, otherwise uber is easy.    only small problem is the wc space is a bit small..."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,loved podshare!     i&amp;#39;m a freelancer so i work in la a week at a time. i only stayed here on a wednesday and spent less than 24 hours there but loved it.    it&amp;#39;s so clean! super clean! so if you need clean here you go.    the beds are so comfortable!!!!     the sheets are perfect      but:  the internet sucks when everyone is on it.    it was a little difficult to find. the address isn&amp;#39;t visible and they use their logo as a sign.    street parking only.
Mexico,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"definitely would come here again! everyone is super nice and welcoming 😁 there's netflix on the tvs, food for the community, they provide you with a towel, and even some shower/morning essentials!"
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"superb stay. we were able to find parking easily, gain access into the building on our own quite easily at 5am as well with the access code provided, &amp; the pod was comfortable along with very accommodating. "
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"beds were really comfortable. we are community breakfast, which rocked. audrey very helpful. be bikes were just ok, the locks wee horrible. loved it overall!"
Turkey,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"podshare is an experience every hostel-traveler should go through, you might feel a bit discomfortable at first to stay at an all-open room for 18 people, but then it feels more private and friendly at the same time than staying in a small room of some bunk beds. podshare arts district was especially comfortable and clean, and the staff was very friendly- we almost preferred to stay inside rather than going out and exploring la! "
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,8,10,8,6,8,8,10,"it would be great for young people traveling but it does not make a good workspace. the owners were having a heated conversation while i was doing a bit of last minute trip planning.  i never ended up getting work done there, i went to a cafe near by. the area is great and the food is outstanding."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,6,10,10,10,"i had a great time staying here. it has a great atmosphere and everyone interacts pleasantly with each other, while respecting your space. the whole unit kept in immaculate condition and it&amp;#39;s great to relax in your own pod with the roku. the only downside is the late night noise from osso dtla across the street and the small bathrooms. i would definitely stay here again though.  "
USA,Male,41+,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,they totally jacked me around they are walking turds i am very  angry about their unprofessionalism
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay here. i love the fact that everyone has their own tv with almost any show or movie you want to watch. super friendly and helpful staff. 
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a usefull and awesome place for short timers.
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this was a fantastic place to stay, lots of younger visitors that are easy to get along with. it is in a great location 20 minute walk from venice beach and has lots of food and bar options surrounding.   the staff are great, helpful and friendly ready and willing to help out with any questions you have about the place or the surrounding area. the place itself is really interesting and can accomodate people who need their own space or who are happy to socialise. i would recommend this to anyone.  "
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,8,8,8,my stay was very great. met sone really cool people
Germany,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,way better than staying in downtown. the fact hostel provides everything i need and people were really helpful. the house is old but very beautiful and located in a quite area close to the beach.
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"could do with more lockers, possibly in the rooms, but this isn't really an issue. it's a really relaxed place in a really nice area. the staff are all great; really welcoming and friendly. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,absolutely amazing place;) staff very helpful and friendly! finding a better place for this price is not possible. thanks a lot to the venice beach hostel to be a part of my trip. xoxoxo
USA,Male,31-40,3.1,2,6,2,2,2,6,2,"i've stayed in a lot of hostels all over the u.s, so i feel confident ensuring you that this is the absolute worst one.  ever.  and for a number of reasons! but first, and most importantly: the guy who checked us in at around 11:00pm was wearing a red donald trump ""make america great again"" hat.  and it wasn't a joke.  i asked him.  my girlfriend, who is of color, was so scared to stay there after i told her.  this is also not the location they advertise! it's so much farther away.  liars."
Argentina,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,staff was really helpful and friendly...everything clean and nice...great value for money...
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,i had a great experience in l.a. and the venice beach hostel has been a big part of this experience.  for sure i will be back.
Germany,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this place is an absolutely run down dirty old house - not even half of the beds are proper beds, most of them pretty much camp beds. we hadn't even booked for that place but got rebooked by the owner from the original address to this place (more than twice as far to the beach btw) without even asking. the so called ""private"" rooms entrance is through a dorm and basically nothing more than two camp beds put in a huge bathroom. if you want to relive a filthy 70s porn you might be right..."
USA,Male,18-24,3.4,4,2,8,2,2,2,4,"this was the worst stay at a hostel i've ever experienced. my third night in, the window next to the door was shattered by what i'm assuming was one of the many nearby homeless men. instead of fixing the window (a huge safety and security risk) the manager had the audacity to blame us for breaking it and now (3 days later) the window is still broken. on top of this issue, the electricity went out for a day, the kitchen sink was clogged and unusable, and frankly most of the employees were rude. "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,"ian the manager is very friendly and professional, remembers everybody's name even though he sees 20 new people per day. breakfast included is very good with fruits, cereals, toasts and all kinds of jams. the place is kept very clean and great atmosphere ! the price is good compare to most other hostels, but dormitory rooms for more than 20$ don't seem fair, i guess this is la... :)"
USA,Male,41+,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,6,10,they have 2 locations. i was at the one closer to the beach. it had free all day parking. this is their secondary location so it was almost empty. on first night there was another person in 6-bed dorm room and on second night i was the only one. all in all great value for money.
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great spot eric was so helpful. literally helped me out with everything i needed. hooked me up with the best bars with live music in venice and his recommendation got a 10/10 from me. will definitely stay again. steve ireland 🇮🇪 
Argentina,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,4,4,10,6,8,"the hostel was ok but if i knew there were two locations and that i would have been 25 mins walking from the beach, then i would have liked to know beforehand. there were two showers for all the hosts and you pay $2 for a towel. the stuff is professional and luckily i got my bed early. "
Slovakia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"super cozy hostel with great owner and workaway staff. we had really really cool encounters with fellow travelers. well equiped kitchen, free (basic) breakfast, so close to the venice beach - hotspot for surf, skate and incredible sunsets. seems like there's no better place to stay in la and chill at the same time. the hostel also looks super cool, makes you feel at home in an instant. we loved our stay. thank you!"
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,"address they give us the wrong one... they need to make that clear when booking or just change the address online. there is nothing outside to say that it is the hostel, some signage would be good. other than that, check in was great. lots of information provided.  basic but good breakfast. good location! i’d recommend "
China,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,6,10,8,6,"the hostel’s address on the web is wrong....... the right one is 2915 yale ave. i wish i would know it before i came. the whole environment is fine and the landlord is very kind, however the locker is too old and small."
USA,Couple,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"the place is very well located; close to the airport and obviously, venice beach. just a block away is great food at sunny spot and walking distance is the cheesecake factory, yum! there are nearby bus stops and a very friendly and tolerable owner. i’m sorry for the mess!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i’ve stayed at many hostels and this was by far my favorite. everyone is so nice, friendly, and helpful. iain the owner does a great job keeping it safe and quite. i felt at home and would definitely come back. it’s close to the beach and conveniently located to everything i wanted to see. i definitely recommend staying"
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,4,4,8,4,2,8,8,rude rude rude staff. guests where fantastic. be weary of hidden charges and costs they don’t list! 
China,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay at the venice beach hostel. very friendly host and guests. very clean rooms. close to the beach and many restaurants. very conveniently located to many bus routes. felt safe walking around at night in this neighborhood. i’ll definitely come back again!
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,10,2,6,8,2,"sweet location, really hippie vibe, smells like urine and dust. literally an inch of dust on the carpet. the ""private room"" is an old dressing room inside an 8 bedded room with a random bath in the room. positives: the water was hot and amazing! "
Norway,Male,31-40,6.9,6,6,8,4,8,8,8,"wrong address on hostelworld, only two bathrooms shared by everyone, horrible matress, o.k. location, friendly staff, easy to get to from airport."
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"this place felt like home. great staff, good location, and a friendly atmosphere. i think this place attracts good people and good energy, i felt very comfortable. free breakfast was a bonus and the kitchen facilities were pretty good.    if i return to venice i would stay again for sure. "
England,Female,41+,2.9,2,2,2,2,6,4,2,"old unloved grubby poorly maintained property, broken electrical sockets, door handles missing. over crowded dorms 4 people sleeping on the floor. beds are wobbly camp beds, old saggy mattresses old bobbly sheets with a smelly furry blanket, yuk! just 2 showers and toilets in the whole building. no privacy just a shower curtain between you &amp; everyone else using the unisex bathroom, no door locks. kitchen, filthy oven that didn't work, tap fitting taped together. $10 card charge. not near beach!"
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,owner was very nice and gave us information about the area.   we also rented bikes from them. bikes could use some maintenance.
Portugal,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,8,8,"if you're looking for the cheapest place in la and close to the beach, this is the place. this is not the best hostel i've been but you get what you pay. i was just looking for a place to sleep so for me it was more than enough. the rooms are maybe overcrowded, they even have beds in the middle of the room. and the bed where i've slept in is far from being comfortable. the check in was slow (it was with sam and everything is made on paper lol) but the staff is nice and helpful."
Finland,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,"our stay at venice beach hostel was just perfect. staff was so helpful, especially this one girl anna who gave us the best tips. its walking distance to the beach and with bikes even better. there's only two bathrooms and the privacy with those was a bit nah, but worked out. very cute, felt like home. "
Ireland,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,6,2,10,10,6,"great people and great vibe, proper backpacker stay but the beds are the very worst that i've seen in any country and the bathrooms are a joke, fully open and shared, no privacy whatsoever."
Italy,MixedGroup,31-40,4.3,2,4,4,4,8,4,4,stay away
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,very friendly and great for international travel. close to venice beach and easy with a bike rental
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay here, the staff was friendly and there were a lot of cool people there making the stay even more fun! the bar scene is really good and walking distance, the beach is walking distance, and santa monica pier is about a 15 minute drive or 30 minutes by bike. the breakfast is small but that is fine as there are lots of places to eat nearby. "
Hungary,Male,31-40,5.4,4,10,4,2,6,6,6,"crowded rooms, uncomfortable, old beds, just 2 bathrooms for 25+ without lock on the door, no privacy. but still, it was a pleasant stay. "
Germany,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,10,4,2,"i've been in many hostels around the world, but i never saw such a disgusting hostel. i did not want to use their blanket and used my own towel.   another bad point is that they have two locations, you check in in the nice one and then you i had to go 1km or so down the street to the other location. also breakfast was only served on the top location and the whole divide makes it no nice atmosphere in the hostel (at least if you stay in the lower location)"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel, super helpful and friendly staff. insanely easy to get to from the airport.  i've stayed here twice and will stay here again next time i pass through la. thanks again guys look forward to seeing you next time :)"
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,6,6,10,10,10,"overall, i had a positive stay at this hostel. staff was extremely friendly and helpful upon check-in. the only downside and recommendation i'd have for management is to upgrade some of the dorm beds. i slept in the large dorm room (14 beds) and had a very, very poor mattress (top bunk un the back right by the closet). "
Argentina,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,"good breakfast, friendly staff, old matresses"
England,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,6,6,4,there was only one bathroom for at least 10 people and things did not seem clean.  also the included breakfast is a 15 minute walk away at the other property.  not really as stated and not really worth the money.
USA,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,cheap place. the double room is very small
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is ""aerospace"" chris.  very nice staff very friendly and accommodating for my last minute travels.    will do it again."
Lithuania,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"i really enjoyed my short stay in this hostel. the place was very close to the beach and staff was nice, helpful and friendly.  definitely cool place to stay, explore and meet people. would recommend and would stay here again."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place just needs better wifi
France,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,6,8,10,10,10,"auberge sympathique, propre et convivial mais peu de place dans les chambres."
Lithuania,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place for a great price with one of the friendliest people i ever met
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,4,10,10,"i had a great time here at the venice beach hostel thanks to the owner who provided a continental breakfast for us every morning, and was the most courteous. as for the rest of the staff, most were very welcoming and helpful except for one russian lady employee who was completely dismissive towards me during my entire stay, made racist jokes around me, really made sure i noticed their trump patriotism, and treated everyone i spent time with poorly too. hopefully that gets sorted out, thank you."
England,Female,18-24,3.1,2,2,8,2,4,2,2,"this hostel is the worst i have stayed in in the us.   it is dark and dingy, and looks like it hasn't been redecorated in 20 years. the doors are constantly wide open with easy access to all of the rooms from anyone outside.  inside the rooms, they have crammed as many beds in as possible. the mattress was the most uncomfortable mattress i have ever slept in and kept sliding off the bed.   i left with 30 mosquito bites.   there are 2 unisex showers for everyone, with no where private to change."
Singapore,Male,31-40,5.7,4,6,8,4,10,4,4,"creaking double decker beds, there is no decent ladder up the beds, 1 bathroom to 12 people at least, no lockers to secure your stuff, very hot rooms in summer with no fan and lack of power outlets. it looks like one of those workers quarters. (note i stayed not at the 'main hostel' but at another building)    good location and the people running the hostel were friendly, but the place is one of the most run down hostels i have lived in.  "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,everyone is nice and friendly at the hostel. the staff are great and are very fun and welcoming. the people who stay there are always happy and are very nice. it is a very clean hostel with great facilities. i will definately be staying there again when i go back to la.
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,a place i would definitely recommend. i booked last minute very late at night and the staff were flexible and very friendly upon my late arrival. great atmosphere in the house! 
England,MixedGroup,18-24,5.7,6,6,8,2,8,8,2,"atmosphere was friendly and welcoming, but the hostel was a disappointment for la, venice, writing on the walls and ceiling was quirky but when paired with the old, dirty, no linen beds made it feel like a homeless shelter. i've stayed at a lot of hostels, and military barracks and the bed furniture here was the worst i've ever experienced. lockers were too small to handle larger bags, which was recommended that we leave them in the garage, this was not secure at all. shame as staff were great!"
Germany,AllMaleGroup,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"we couldn't sleep directly in the hostel as they told us it was full. so they brought us to a partner house which was the dirtiest hostel i've been sleeping. there was only one bathroom for the whole house and the kitchen was super old and dirty. also there was a disgusting smell in our room.     also it was strange that they only take cash payments. the guy told us that the device is broken... ""so we only take cash"".  i would not go there again! "
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"stayed in a private room and really enjoyed my stay.  location was great, staff was awesome - anna was super helpful and told us about bars nearby, food spots, and showed us all around the hostels 2 locations.    i read a few reviews before booking and some have inaccurate info about this place.  one said it's not near the beach, it's "
Scotland,Male,18-24,4.3,4,2,2,4,6,6,6,the place is just a big house. got put in a bedroom with 13 beds squeezed in which were uncomfortable and the bottom bunk had a tiny amount if room.     2 toilets and 2 showers for the whole hostel isn't great. when you do take a shower theres no where to get changed as there is no locks on the bathroom so people just walk in.     staff were alright. some were really nice some just stared at you.    wouldn't stay there again.
Canada,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,the atmosphere created by the staff is great. all were extremely helpful and one staff member anna helped us immensely as well as baked everybody cheesecake! worth the stay.
France,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,nice people and very nice location.
Italy,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6,2,4,10,2,10,10,4,"i wouldn't recommend this hostel, although some positive charachteristics partially compensate for the poor accomodation.  facilities' quality is extremely low: bunk beds with old, broken and uncomfortable mattresses. some guest had to share beds. not very clean, with no bed sheets, 2$ for towels and cash only payments (10$ extra for using a card). only 2 restrooms.  what's good: location cant be better in la, the owner is a funny englishman, staff girls are cool and pretty, easy going atmosphere."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,6,4,6,10,4,6,8,4,"keep in mind most of the price you pay for the location. i actually didn't like my stay. i expected way more for the money. the bed was horrible, the dormroom looks like a orphan house. bedsheets seemed not clean and smelled as if someone pied in it. couldn't close the bathroom and bedroom door. didn't feel unsafe though."
Ireland,Female,18-24,8,4,10,10,4,10,10,8,"this hostel was really lovely. very chilled out, friendly environment. ian has done a really good job creating a safe space for travellers like myself to come home to after the chaos that can unfold in venice beach. i'm terrible with names, but that russian guy and his girlfriend who work there are so so kind, genuinely would not have had as great a time in venice without them! "
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was perfect! the value was solid and it wasn't too far from the beach. there was also an in-n-out burger close by as well. the staff was extremely nice! maciej, was by far the funniest and most entertaining staff memeber. he laughed at my stories and made me feel welcomed. in the morning he even offered to share some of his breakfast with me. i couldn't have chosen to stay at a better hostel in los angeles. if you want to feel welcomed and have a good time, stay here."
Netherlands,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,4.3,4,2,8,2,8,4,2,"we we're put in the second location of the hostel. we didn't know this until we were there. i got an email witch sad that we were to go there to check in. not that we had to stay there. the beds were horrible. old, squeaky and the matras  was sacked. it didn't feel clean. there are only two bathrooms and you can't lock it if you take a shower. the staff was really nice. the one thing i did like was when you brush your teeth you look out of a window instead of a mirror. "
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"banana was an excellent place to stay! realy in the heart of a great part of la. very walkable. great staff, great atmosphere, and clean hip vibes :)"
Chile,Male,31-40,4.9,4,8,6,4,4,4,4,"i've been traveling the world for many years. this trip i invited my best friend who does not travel much &amp; booked the misleading ""venice beach hostel"". property is not near the beach at all. (not in venice?). main issue was energy &amp; attitude of the manager. he made us feel very un-welcomed. my friend is 10 years older but he is a kid at heart. he embarrassed us in front of other guests, way overcharged us for a lost bike lock ($40!). completely ignored me during checkout. we also saw a bed bug."
England,Female,25-30,6,6,4,6,4,10,4,8,"no key to the property so in theory anyone could enter, but there are small lockers to store your valuables.  can feel the springs in the bed and no sheet, just a blanket which isn't washed between guests.  only two showers and toilets for property, and no where to change in privacy.  other facilities all good.  decent location and transport links. decent breakfast including fruit. "
Sweden,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,10,10,10,2,"great place with a good location, pretty hard to find if you haven't read the instructions properly though. staff is great although the polish guy is a bit wierd.  location is as said good, only a 20 min walk to venice beach amd they have bikes for rent at the hostel!"
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6.9,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,"big social area, feels like a big friendly house. positive vibes. about 25mins from the beach. only downside is that there were only two showers/toilets for the whole hostel"
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,8,6,8,8,6,4,8,"good value for money and location, easy to rent bikes and staff are helpful (if a little serious). breakfast is decent. however not a great atmosphere and you have to be quiet in the evenings as it's a residential area. there is very little privacy in the bathrooms and the rooms didn't feel very clean with no sheets provided, just blankets at the end of the bed that didn't seem that they had been washed for each new guest. "
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,could not fault ian and the staff at the venice beach hostel. great location accompanied by the traditional hostel experience. thanks for having me! 
Australia,Female,31-40,6.6,8,4,6,2,10,8,8,is it really that hard to get door locks or even door handles on the bathroom doors? jesus christ. every time i had a shower or went to the toilet i had at least 2 people walk in on me.
Italy,Male,25-30,4,2,4,4,2,2,8,6,u have to pay for towels; pay for leaving luggages 1 hour after check out; staff is not friendly except the older man.
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely amazing hostel in an amazing location. literally the best hostel i have ever stayed in, the staff were helpful and always up for a good laugh :d "
Poland,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"the hostel is located around 25mins from the venice beach pier! the owner ian is a lovely, very helpful person. he even took my friend to the hospital after spider bite! staff is so nice and friendly ( two russian anna's- hi girls :),)apart from jaida who thinks she is at least a celebrity and looks down her nose at people which wasn't pleasant especially when checking in!     facility has got only two bathrooms but suprisingly it was never crowded.     place was always clean and fresh :) "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place , great staff , great location..  super great prices with aaa+ staff ,   close to the beach , bus , food ..  you will be happy you was here ...  i stood for 3 night and very happy over all "
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"ive actually stayed at both locations (the main big hostel has a smaller sister apt for overflow.) the main hostel is this huge beautiful and airy old craftsman  house. very comfortable and feels like a home. the dorm rooms have huge vaulted ceilings. its kind of a nice respite from the boring norm. bags of character.  . the smaller apt is a little bit closer to the beach, which is a good 20 minute walk. rent a bike like i did! best decision ever."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"we stayed in the hostel for 3 nights and it was brilliant. the atmosphere was so comfortable, everyone was open and friendly and willing to integrate with everyone. the host was great, friendly and helpful. the rooms were very clean and spacious! location was about 20 minute walk away from venice beach, so pretty good too.  would highly recommend this hostel!"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,"confusion with payment, however amaing location! only thing that could improve is comfort of the beds."
Poland,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i had a really nice stay at the hostel.  the staff who work there is very friendly and helpful. thanks to the common area there a good opportunity to meet new people which makes the stay even more enjoyable. the place is very clean and the location is vary goo too, its within a walking distance from the beach."
Switzerland,Male,25-30,7.4,4,10,8,4,10,8,8,great staff! very friendly and helpful.   the beds are really not that great and compfy and it's pretty important to me as it's what you pay for at the end of the day. that could improved for sure and it would make the experience great. 
Canada,Female,25-30,5.1,6,6,8,4,6,4,2,"it's relatively cheap for the location, i guess, but other than that, i suggest looking elsewhere. staff are nice enough but there isn't really any atmosphere, the wifi was always super slow or not working.. the room that i was staying in was way too over crowded and they just moved my stuff without asking &amp; added another bed in there when there was already very little space. beds were super uncomfortable. i would not recommend. "
CzechRepublic,Female,25-30,5.7,6,2,6,6,8,6,6,"i have booked to stay at venice beach hostel but was put into some other house remade into hostel.   there were no locks on the door into the hostel and also no lock for the dorm rooms, the doors were open most of the time.  the facilities weren't as good as in the main venice beach hostel. there were only two bathrooms for the entire place which had 20dorm room and several 8 dorm rooms i suppose. this means only two toilets and two showers for everyone. also the toilet was within the bathroom."
USA,Couple,25-30,5.7,4,4,8,6,8,6,4,"a decent place to stay but a little weird.  none of the dorms have locks on the doors and they do have lockers but you need your own pad lock.  there's also no great places to change, the bathrooms also do not lock.  while i'm sure the sheets have been washed, they were probably purchased 15 years ago and are pretty dirty, ours had dried blood on it.  staff was nice and it's a 30 walk to the beach.  hostel is not marked with signs so make sure you know the house number."
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i've never written a review in my life but this hostel is that good that i wrote one. such a cozy, homey space, and immaculately clean. perfect location, with easy access to the beach, venice, santa monica, and all of la's west side. the owner (ian) and the girl who is working over this summer (anna) are such kind and accommodating people, that made me feel right at home. i completely believe that if you want a cozy yet cheap stay in la, there is no better option than the venice beach hostel!

Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,great hostel and amazing staff! enjoyed my stay in there.
England,Couple,18-24,8.6,6,8,8,8,10,10,10,"hostel was nice, it's a converted large house so it still has a homey vibe. we stayed for 1 night in a twin room and there were board games and a tv in the living room as well as leaflets for activities in the area. anna, who checked us in, was very helpful and gave us a list ofthings to do in the area. the hostel has good restaurants near by (c&amp;a cucina is amazing) and easy access to the beach and lax. the negative was paying $5 each to store luggage at the hostel after we checked out after 12."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such a wonderful place to stay! staff were amazing. they stayed up late because we got stuck getting into la. great vibe, nice rooms, great location for the beach!"

England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,really enjoyed the hostel . had a great vibe. walking distance to venice beach . beds are basic but fine. no air con but wasn't an issue as windows open though out .  highly recommend and would stay again!

Romania,Female,25-30,4.6,4,6,4,2,8,6,2,"pros: the house is in a nice neighborhood, the house has an interesting allure and charm.  cons: not enough showers and toilets for the capacity of people, very uncomfortable, old mattress, weird smell all around, generally unclean (toilets, shower with mold on the curtain), you can find  places closer to the beach with better facilities and for only a few bucks extra. i tried to make my stay there as short as possible, and it was definitely not worth the amount i paid. "
Kuwait,Male,25-30,6,2,10,6,2,10,10,2,great staff. 
England,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,rude staff
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,6,10,10,10,10,"the location is far from the beach and the center of town, but there is a good bus system and it's pretty easy to bike to (and along) the beach. make sure you check out the canal. the common areas were nice but there were too many beds in the room, and most of the beds are very old and uncomfortable. "
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,6,6,6,6,10,"has 2 locations, i stayed at the less fancier one. it was very basic barebones type feel. there were no staff or main desk where i stayed. tv room just a couch with old tv. big kitchen tho."
Germany,Female,25-30,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,"open house with spacious dorms and common area. however, just two bathrooms without proper separated showers/toilets and possibilities to change. plus, everyone was basically able to walk in and out of the house."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really nice hostel and good location to the beach. you can rent bikes for cheap and bike down santa monica/venice beach.  staff are super friendly and helpful. the only thing was that the room i was in had slate windows,  so it was quite a noisy sleep due to traffic outside.  other than that one thing everyone was great!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,loved this one place!
Ireland,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a great hostel, beautiful beach style with verandas and billowing nets. its clean, cool, near the beach, comfortable and with a great breakfast. i had a short stay but during my time the staff were really helpful especially marco who went way beyond the call of duty to help me with travel arrangements to an event i was going too. i had an short but exceptional time.... noel"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved this hostel - the staff, house, location, other guests were all great. i had a lovely time in this chilled out beach vibe. everyone was really lovely. would totally recommend and return. "
NewZealand,Male,31-40,8.9,8,6,10,10,10,10,8,"loved the place! the vibe, staff, location, i went back a number of times, really liked the friendly  welcoming people- the travellers and the staff. definitely will recommend to others. no pick-up from lax but the bus is easy. can be difficult how get a park at times."
Canada,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,really nice stay at the hostel!!! staff was great and good location!!!!
Canada,Male,31-40,6,4,8,10,4,6,6,4,"the best part about this hostel is the location! it's walkable distance away from the venice beach. other than that, this hostel is not good. check in place is different from my stay, and while walkable it's a bit far. i say that because in the morning breakfast is only available in the check in place, and from 9-10. there's only 1 bathroom shared by everyone there. the place also looks old and dirty, and the room kinda smells too. having said that i only stayed 1 night so it was ok to crash."
Canada,Male,18-24,4.3,4,2,6,2,8,4,4,"facilities were not at all as described 20 minute walk to venice beach. owner marco was very nice and accommodating. hostel was basically a one floor apartment two of the privates were beds literally jammed into closets so the only thing in the room was a bed. windows had to be open constantly as there was no ac making it impossible to sleep from highway noise, the top bunk i slept on was ready to fall/collapse at any moment and having only 1 bathroom between 7-10 guests extremely frustrating "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,3.4,2,4,6,2,2,2,6,"place was not at all a hostel. more like a converted house with no privacy in bathrooms, terrible lounge/kitchen and rooms, aggressive staff and a weird vibe. 1/10 would not recommend "
Belgium,Male,25-30,4.3,2,4,2,6,4,6,6,"it was difficult to find the hostel, apparently there are two locations (second building is on yale av) and we didn't know about the second location's address. the address was not mentioned on our confirmation e-mail nor on the website.  "
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"really loved my stay here, just what you want from a hostel: good atmosphere, friendly people, good location and good facilities. loved it so much i stayed longer! thank you guys for having me :)"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place. great staff. great location. made a new friend and had a great time. will definitely come back again.
India,Male,31-40,5.1,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,"not the best hostel i've stayed it. owner or manager wants to keep a ""holiday"" environment, so he moved me to another unit with no one in it. i ended up partying harder than anyone there, i just handle my business during the day. anyway i love hostels and go to them a lot, but would never stay at this one again. thanks ! "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,8,6,"great stay!!! l it's pretty much what all of us adventurers are looking for. just want to note that this hostel doesn't have ac - just propped open windows/doors, which would be fine if there was a massive breeze but frankly i was hot and sweating when i was not directly in front of a window/door. this also let a lot of mosquitos in so bring bug repellant. (2) there's a lingering odor assuming bec the entire house, except for downstairs area, is all carpet (even in the bathroom). "
Mexico,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,6,4,4,6,"very uncomfortable beds, no privacy in the shower, the location is different that the one posted, weird thing going on with the final price, i asked to 2 people they both told me a different thing, smell weird in some places of the hostel."
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,my friend and i enjoyed our stay very much. safe + clean + great location. the staff was professional and friendly- they know how to do what they do well. thank you so much for having us!
France,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"super stay at venice beach hostel. marco the owner is super cool and gives good tips on venice and la ! ! great location, cheap bike rents for the day, great atmosphere in the hostel. i highly recommend"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great staff, very good hostel it's nice and relaxed and very close to everything. the beach is only 30 mins walk. breakfast was good and they had english football channel so very good if your a british lad. overall great hostel would stay again. "
Norway,Male,18-24,4.3,4,4,8,4,4,4,2,"we were 15 people in our room, other people had four or six people in their room with a private bathroom and they paid the same money. only two bathrooms in the whole hostel with little privacy. "
USA,Female,25-30,6,4,8,8,4,6,8,4,"i don't recommend staying at this hostel. it smelled (even with windows open), bathrooms were dirty, main light in my room didn't work, and i could feel the springs in my back when lying on the bed. the lockers are small and in a different location from the bedrooms.  you would think with the money they make off the guests they could fix a few things or clean up a bit.   pay $10/20 more and find an airbnb in the area, you'll be happy you did. "
Poland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good value for money, amazing atmosphere. i have really enjoyed my time in this place. thanks #thevenicebeachhostel ;) "
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,6,10,8,8,"staff here were very friendly and helpful. good location and very easy to get to from the airport. mixup with the hostel location, it was not the same as what was on the website. bed was uncomfortable, and being on the top bunk i sometimes felt like was going to fall out. would recommend for a short stay like i did (1 night)."
USA,Male,25-30,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,10,"great place, ~1 mile from the beach. i only stayed the night but everything was super clean and the people working there were very nice. "
Ukraine,Male,25-30,3.1,2,6,2,2,4,4,2,"the place was not as described. the address was a different one that was stated when purchased. they didn't even allow to leave bags by the end of the day, and demanded additional payment of $35 as if i was going to stay for a night. the breakfast is awful. very disappointed!    notice for a british guy who is suposed to be the host: ukraine cannot use with the article 'the' according to the english grammar rules."
Netherlands,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,not very clean and location not superb. very friendly people though!
Venezuela,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i appreciate very much the friendliness and helping me with directions.  thankful for the fresh fruit offered with breakfast.   i liked the large shower with plenty of room for also getting dressed with privacy after taking one, also that the bathroom was clean and sanitized.  i will recommend on having softer mattress specially for women is uncomfortable laying facing down and feeling the  the metal coils. great home with much character. i had a sweet time staying at this hostel. "
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"attentive alert friendly staff.  the hostels i stayed in in uk and ireland 11 years ago had lockers large enough to put my luggage in, and they rented out padlocks for the lockers.  the ""lockers"" listed here were about 0.9 cubic feet or 25500 cc, enough for wallet, purse, keys, etc.  if i hadn't had a car to lock things in i would have had to carry around my luggage. the neighborhood was nice for parking the car.  cracks  on outside of shower will allow framing decay eventually."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"me and my friend loved this hostel. the people there make all the difference as it is quite small and you are in close proximity. the staff sam and marco were great and happy to help, it had a real family home feeling. it's close to venice beach and has allot around. will definitely be going back. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,6,10,10,10,that bed was rough
Mexico,Female,25-30,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,6,8,"the beds are very uncomfortable, in fact they gave us no beds, the first night they gave us a couple of mattress in a loft, and the next day they gave my friend an old mattress where she could not  sleep. some of the staff are very nice but not all of them. we made a mistake in the reservation but the owner did very little to help us. the location is ok. "
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.9,8,6,8,6,8,4,8,"no one was there to greet us when we first arrived for a few minutes, which wouldn't have been a big deal if other guests hadn't made uncomfortable comments to the friends traveling with me. good location and very friendly owner, but wasn't fully comfortable staying long in the hostel itself."
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,4,6,10,8,8,10,8,"as the guy said.  those condos down the street cost 2 mil a pop a piece or you can stay at vbc for ~50 a night.  great place, great ppl.  "
USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,6,10,10,10,10,10,"this was a great place to stay and everyone we met, staff and other patrons, were great to be around. will definitely try and stay again when visiting."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great hosts! they will make you feel welcome right away! the atmosphere is very relaxed and the rooms and bathrooms are basic, but clean. overall, i had a great stay. "
Poland,Female,31-40,6.3,6,6,8,6,8,6,4,"there is no parking, you park on the street. "
Canada,Male,18-24,4.3,2,4,6,2,8,6,2,terrible beds.   2 showers only  2 toilets only.  not clean
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"this spot was in the perfect location, felt clean, &amp; welcoming.  the staff was friendly and all visitors were kind and outgoing.  "
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,its a bit cold on the 3 weeks a year it rains.  
Germany,Female,25-30,4.3,2,2,6,2,8,4,6,"not really worth the money. if you like drunk people or drinking too much that's the place for you. it´s not a big deal if someone is completely drunk and spreads his stink there. couldn´t breathe when i had breakfast. staff is cleaning everyday, but there´s still smutch from the past years on the surfaces. you don´t even get a duvet cover for your blanket, not very hygienic. you cannot lock the showers and the toilets. there´s just 2 bathrooms for many rooms. the breakfast was simple and okay."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nothing worse than being sick on vacation. the staff was so helpful about everything. i was lucky i stayed there. a+++
Austria,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,2,8,8,6,8,4,8,"there were two locations of the hostel, one where we checked in and one where we stayed. both of them difficult to find, no signs. we had a private room, which was very small and cold. the breakfast was at the other location, so we would have had to walk outside and walk a few minutes, what´s not very convenient when it´s raining really hard.  the stuff was nice but all in all it was way too expensive for this accommodation.  i was disappointed from the hostel."
England,Male,25-30,4.3,2,6,6,2,6,6,2,"old house turned hostel. the place smells. 2 bathrooms and 2 showers for 30+ people. privacy whilst showering: only a flimsy curtain, and the shower is in the main bathroom (which cannot be locked). beds are very squeeky and you can feel the springs through the mattress: bad back guaranteed in the morning. can't say if the sheets were clean or not. towels are 2$ extra. floor has very old dusty carpet. kitchen makes you want to clean everything twice before using it.  "
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,"it's as grungy as any hostel. all the facitilities function well, but there's just a bit of that odd charm, like why is there a van in the storage space? it doesn't really matter though. it's pretty to get to venice beach if you want on the bus line. it's not really close to any metro, so it's a bit of a trek to get anywhere else in the city if you don't have a car. if you do have a car, there's a lot of amazing drives really close by."
Australia,Couple,31-40,6.9,8,6,6,6,8,8,6,"we stayed two nights at the hostel. the staff we friendly but it's a very basic hostel. it's about a 15 minute walk to venice beach, about an hour walk to santa monica pier. the rooms were relatively clean but could be improved. a few new things in this hostel would help a huge amount."
Colombia,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"nice hostel in a prime location. just rent a bike for $15 the whole da from the hostel and ride the bike route to the beach,  follow beach bike route north stooping at the shops in venice, the pier in santa monica. i you are in good shape go up to the bel-air bay club where the beach bike route ends. the bikes at the hostel is really cheap when compared with the the rent bikes shops. "
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice hostel, just a few minutes from the beach. different concept really, looks and feels very cosy and friendly. met some really cool people there. the manager ian is a really nice guy, he helped me out a lot and i suppose is pretty nice for an englishman. highly recommend this place."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"terrific staff, great atmosphere and a great place to stay if you like hostels, the only thing that put me off was that the beds were not the most comfortable, the springs were quite hard."
USA,Female,31-40,5.7,6,6,10,4,4,6,4,"i was greeted with, ""you can only stay for a few days because americans steal."" bread for breakfast. windows open all night so some guests were literally catching cold. people they liked less were sent to another location. lack of privacy with windows that won't shut. just... weird."
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,4.6,4,4,6,4,2,8,4,"the worst staff i have ever met. they told us they were making a huge exception for us since were american.tati and the manager were rude,condescending&amp; judgmental. when they got there they kept questioning why we wanted to stay there&amp; treated us like criminals&amp;made us feel extremely unwelcome just because were american.we asked 4 a refund&amp;said we werent going to stay there regardless&amp;they said no&amp;once again were condescending,telling us they were doing us a favor because we were dressed nicely."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really nice hostel.  friendly staff. nice quiet and homey feel with a great interior and comfy beds.  near lots of places to eat/drink/chill.  i'd definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone. 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thumbs up
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great staff. good location and nice hostel. close to the beach and away from the dirt of downtown la
Belgium,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"very cosy hostal with a nice athmosphere.. venice is a super nice area to recomand for a stay in la.  only real negative point of the hostel is the lack or restrooms and showers. only two for the whole building,that really is toi few."
England,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,6,10,8,8,"weird hostel, sort of worked though. the staff were really great all round. breakfast for one hour and early checkout coupled with having to vacate the hostel and pay for luggage storage is a bit rubbish. but looking at prices in venice maybe fair enough, just new to us for a hostel. felt like you were staying at a friends house at uni but again seemed to work in its own way. would stay again if we stayed in venice."
Switzerland,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,it was perfect. the staff was great and i met some awesome people.   i hope i can go back there soon.
Brazil,MixedGroup,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"hostel is fine, nothing really special. bathroom kinda weird, tho. there is only two full bathrooms in the house and a thin curtain splits the one showering and the rest of the users, creepy. i should mention that is not the most comfortable bed, neither the worst. the bed have only springs, no bases, so when you lay down, you kinda sink on the mattress and when your roomie of the higher bed arrives, you might think if the springs will reach you or not (it doesn't). "
England,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, management and staff warm, friendly and very helpful, guests equally so. beautiful location handy for day trips. highly recommended. oh, they watch a game on tv where nothing seems to happen, i think they call it baseball. xx"
Peru,Female,25-30,8,6,10,10,8,8,8,6,cheap and 20min walk from venice beach! nothing beats that. everything is walking distance. really old bunk beds ( i still manage to get a good night sleep) it would be nice if they even painted them to make them look nicer. better if you pay cash. charge you $5 to swipe cc. thanks guys. 
England,Female,25-30,6,4,6,8,4,6,8,6,"great location with jut one road to walk down to get to venice beach- takes about 20-30 mins. large kitchen, but only two bathrooms.  hostel had no signage so take note of the number of the house to find it easily! it is pretty much a house; the conversion to a hostel means that its large rooms with camp beds laid out. we were the last in to stay at this house and given a double bed-people who arrived after us were sent across the road to another house. wifi not that strong due to high demand."
Ireland,Male,25-30,3.1,2,2,8,2,4,2,2,when we went to check in the woman made off and we were left waiting about a half an hour. when we eventually did get to check in the woman informed us we were in fact in another building down the street. upon arrival the place was wide open so anyone could walk in or out. the room was very small and hot with 7 people crammed in together.  the wifi was not working and the place was not very clean at all. would not recommend at all.
Canada,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed our stay - friendly, knowledgeable staff, clean facilities, close to venice beach and other funky places. highly recommend! "
China,Female,18-24,3.7,2,2,8,2,2,6,4,"this hostel is the worst i 've ever stayed in. the beds are really old, stinky and the room seems like a match up with mattresses one just found on the street. moreover they charge you basically for everything! if you wanted to stay till 5 pm after check out you had to pay five dollars. till 10 it was 10 dollars. seriously? a girl who stayed there the night before couldn't hang at the hostel for an hour without paying 5 $. the employees are so unfriendly and rude! stay somewhere else!! "
Australia,Female,25-30,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,6,"i wasn't impressed with the fact that the bathrooms didn't have locks on them and people come come in while i was showering, although there was a shower screen i still didn't feel comfortable  it was a very quite hostel and they never liked any fun "
Finland,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,6,10,10,8,"i stayed at the ""other building"", which is not the one where they have the reception or breakfast. there is only one toilet and one shower and the both are behind the same door, so locking the door while using the one blocks access to the other as well. but hanging out in the lounge area with the other guys was great fun."
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i&amp;#39;ve stayed in many hostels over the years and have to say this one is up there. excellent location with only 20 min walk to venice beach. tons of restaurants and bars and very nice area! felt like a home away from home, staff where really friendly, ian the guy who owns the hostel was very helpful. defiantly got my money&amp;#39;s worth and would recommend anyone to stay! "
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"easy walk to the beach or connections into town, bed was just as you&amp;#39;d expect and the staff were super helpful and friendly. the general atmosphere of the place is also really chilled, not too loud and just generally a great place to hang out in. would definitely recommend. "
Australia,Female,25-30,4.6,2,8,2,2,8,8,2,"overpriced, won't not recommend or stay here again. no where near venice beach, about 20 min walk. no locks on the bathrooms, and only two in the whole hostel, so you always had to wait, they were also very dirty. no ladder for top bunk, all the mattress were disgusting and very old. there was even a mattress on the ground, under the stairs that someone was sleeping on. no where to put my backpack as they was someone living in the room who had there belongings everywhere. "
Philippines,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent choice, very happy l.:  recommend to anyone. cheers"

Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved my stay at the venice beach hostel! the staff working there were extremely friendly! i stayed there for my birthday and they made sure to treat me very well! the people staying there were also super chill and the whole place just seemed to have a really good vibe to it. you can rent bikes there and then bike down to the beach in under 10 minutes, which is super convenient. 10/10 would recommend. "
Switzerland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,4,10,10,10,10,"we were quite disappointed not to be in the hostel located next to the beach. of course, it was just 25 min of walking to reach the beach but it wasn&amp;#39;t what we expected. "
Germany,Male,31-40,5.7,4,4,8,2,8,8,6,"10 people squeezed into a tiny room (nowhere to charge my phone) with shaky bunk beds, no air condition on a noisy street with one bathroom to share with many more people from the other rooms. wifi wasn&amp;#39;t working, no locks for lockers provided. you can leave your luggage after checking out and hang out, but it&amp;#39;ll cost you 5 $.  staff is nice though."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.7,2,6,8,4,8,6,6,"friendly staff and ok location. but, we overpayed! there are cheaper and nicer places through airbnb nearby. the other guests were up all hours of the night and we heard everything, keeping us awake. the bathroom was always occupied. wifi was terrible. won&amp;#39;t be returning."
NewZealand,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,10,8,"staff really helpful and friendly with good atmosphere. the property wasn&amp;#39;t as close to venice beach as expected, about a 15 min walk."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were incredible! i used a surfboard that the hostel had for free and the hoestel itself was in a great location and very clean, only issue was that it wasn&amp;#39;t as well signposted as it could have been, from the outside it looked like a normal house, there was no sign i could see that said &amp;#34;the venice beach hostel&amp;#34; but other than this everything was amazing! "
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,4,6,6,2,8,6,8,we stayed in a private ensuite room for one night. booked a double bed room only to get twin beds that could hardly be put together. there was no shower or even a shower handle in the bath tub and the toilet had no divider? the entire room was one open space with no room for privacy whilst in the toilet. the room entrance is through the doom which meant coming in and out was difficult and you had to be volume conscious. stayed in many ensuite hostels across the world this was quite bad.
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a great time staying here. the staff were sound and the location is great as the beach is only a short walk away. 
Scotland,Male,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,10,10,8,6,"the hostel is split in two locations, both are a short walk to the beach. beds weren't the best, cleanliness could be improved and lockers didn't seem very secure. good free breakfast and friendly staff. overall a good hostel and would stay again. "
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,i had a great time staying at the venice beach hostel. the hostel is a very nice california style two-story house equipped with everything. the staff is fantastic and the facilities are clean. i made a lot of cool friends too    do note that it is a 15 minute walk to the beach from the hostel and make sure to check in at 2915 yale avenue. there is a bus stop a few blocks away at the intersection of lincoln blvd and washington that will get you to and from lax for $1.25 each way
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"beautiful oldie worldie hostel! very homely and cosy environment, very nice staff! "
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"the hostel was split into two locations, the main house seemed like it would've been nice to stay in however we were in the other part of the hostel a short walk away! the location was great to get about venice, the showers were clean and the kitchen was good however the bed i stayed on had seen better days and the dorm was very cramped. a little like what i imagine a crack den to be like! i'd stay here again but would want to stay in the main hostel! "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,for how expensive property is at venice it&amp;#39;s good value for money
Turkey,Male,25-30,4.6,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,very very expensive for what it offers.  there are  much closer hostel/hotels to venice beach   it takes 20 min by foot to get to central part of the venice beach from the hostel&amp;#39;s closest location ( 716 wash blvd )  the key does not work at the outside door for the washington blvd location.   one bathroom/toilet for 10+people we woke up at 6 am and i could only take a shower at 8:15.  
NewZealand,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,"cool place, great vibe, free breakfast was good but for the price they could at least make the bike rental free or fix the wifi. this is expensive for what you get but not a bad choice."
Spain,Female,25-30,4,2,4,8,2,4,6,2,"45 dollar per night to sleep in a thin matress (less than 5cm thick) on the ground, everything quite dirty, no locks in the room... it was an interesting place to see, very alternative, but definetely not worth the price!"
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,my stay was as good as i was  hoping. the staff was polite and informative. i felt welcomed back and certainly will book a stay at there location in the future.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,6,10,10,8,"great hostel, great vibe, great staff.     be prepared to walk about 15-20 minutes to venice beach but for what you pay, particularly compared to other hostels/hotels in the same area, this hostel is a bargain. staff are extremely helpful and friendly.     i would recommend hiring a bike to enhance your stay. bathrooms and shower are up their with the best for hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in. "
USA,Female,18-24,2.9,2,2,2,2,4,2,6,"this hostel is gross. no air conditioning, and windows are open but without screens. the guy made us pay the first night even after we were unhappy with the location cleanliness and atmosphere. it looked like a crack house and is nowhere near venice beach! it&amp;#39;s in marina del rey not venice beach. i do not reccomend this hostel to anyone, it was a disaster. "
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"security - incessantly lacking     location - absurdly distant from the beach from which it steals it&amp;#39;s name     staff - consescending and unhelpful. preposterously annoying habit of shining flashlights and kicking beds whilst we slept ( not a joke they kick your bed to wake you up on the day you&amp;#39;re checking out)    atmosphere - exceedingly boring people, the toilet queues were a literal sh*tfight     value - we were placed in a bigger room then we ordered     facilities - 1 cm foam mattress    "
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel,really friendly atmosphere and welcoming staff, as well as good location!"
England,Female,18-24,5.4,4,6,6,6,4,4,8,"sec: front door open wide, locked from midnight-morning. bedroom balcony door open at night due to no a/c. loc: 20 min walk from beach, restaurants/shops nearby. staff: mixed, some rude, some friendly, one threw away something of mine. atmos: quite boring compared to other hostels. clean: overall pretty clean. vfm: paid less/the same for much better places. facilities: nice downstairs living room w/ couches and tv and cooking facilities, but only 2 showers and toilets for the entire hostel. wnr."
England,Male,31-40,7.7,10,4,8,8,8,8,8,"really good, nice people. the door to the hostel is quite hard to lock so sometimes you come back and the flats been left open with no one in it and double check where your staying as i got put into a spill over flat down the road which wasn&amp;#39;t that bigger deal, but if your booking to be in the big social main hostel this might be a bit of a bummer. would totally recommend this hostel though great for the money and very friendly staff and tenants, great location!"
Italy,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,bad experience ever  very bad owner  the first ever bad experience in a hostel  i don t advice this hostel
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,an amazing experience:) had a wonderful stay!
England,Male,25-30,5.1,2,6,8,4,4,6,6,"no signage to help find the hostel. when we did find it, we were directed to go somewhere else rather than be able to check in where our location was- would have been good to have been told this before and would have saved exhausted, confused people walking up and down the street for far too long."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed staying here. i&amp;#39;m from london and this was my first time visiting the venice area. i met some great people in the 2 days i was there, and all the people that worked their were extremely kind. getting to venice beach itself was super straightforward. would definitely stay at this hostel again, a super chilled environment perfect for the beautiful location in which the hostel is located."
Italy,Female,18-24,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"i booked the s hostel because it was cheap but honestly the staff is one of the worst. the hostel itself is terrible as well. the entire hostel is sharing two toilets and showers. man ,woman and you can&amp;#39;t even lock doors so privacy is not included. no air-conditioning either and so door remain unlocked and no reception so i didn&amp;#39;t feel safe at all.   do yourself a favor. spend that extra money and go somewhere else. you are welcome."
Australia,Male,25-30,5.4,4,2,6,2,8,10,6,"very interesting hostel... basically it&amp;#39;s a giant house with 3 bedrooms... each bedroom has bunk beds cramped into it leaving just enough space to walk between beds/bags... there are two bathrooms for say 30 people.... no locks on either of them... just a shower curtain to stop people having a peep show... with that said..  it had character, i was actually enjoying my time there, it&amp;#39;s super chill and the staff work/live there and are really nice. it&amp;#39;s pretty over priced for what it is...meh"
Australia,Couple,25-30,6,6,6,8,8,6,4,4,beer in the vending machine was awesome but there was a lot of drama/noise at night time.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was so awesome! my first time in a hostel, but i will definitely be using them more often. it was so much fun!"
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,6,4,8,6,10,8,8,"the location was pretty good. close to airport and venice beach. they say they offer a free airport pickup, but it was not driving that day for some reason. the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. the staff was very friendly and helpful. although both buildings were in a pretty safe area, people would often leave the door to the dorm open to the street and the door locks did not work consistently (they were hard to open even with a key). "
Australia,Female,18-24,5.7,6,8,2,4,6,6,8,"this hostel is on the outskirts of la. describing it as &amp;#39;in los angeles,&amp;#39; would be a bit of a stretch. the place is a bit strange, but clean and safe enough. the location is terrible though. the shuttle from lax cost $37 including tip. "
Australia,Male,31-40,6.9,4,6,10,4,10,10,4,"venice beach hostel is actually a house in marina del rey. run down, grungy yet full of character and very friendly staff and guests who all hang out in the lounge area. a bit over priced for what it is but i guess yre paying to be in a good location near the beach. decent free breakfast. the negatives are they need more security lockers as most guests have no where to put there valuables. bathrooms are unisex with no locks or privacy, which i found to be very annoying and the bunks need ladders"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,6,8,4,6,"wouldn&amp;#39;t really call it a hostel. it is more someones house with too many bunk beds/ hospital beds in one room. 12 or 10 person dorm could hardly fit 8 people. terrible value for money. location is ok, 10/15min walk from venice beach."
Israel,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"honestly, this is one of the best hostels i have ever been in. the staff was amazing, iyan anna and were so kind and funny. the location is good and safe and you got food all over the place. great atmosphere and overall great hostel!"
Germany,Male,25-30,2.6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,they sent us to a different location far away from the beach with very bad facilities. will never book that again. there are many hostels in the l.a. area which are a lot better.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great value for money considering the facilities, location and the general atmosphere. the staff are friendly and super helpful. the hostel has great flow with people coming and going all the time but still a chill, relaxed place. it was about 15-20 mins walk away from the beach which considering the price is really convenient. we loved staying here and would again if we were back in venice. "
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,"overall this place has the basics, but the set up is cramped. very relaxed protocol as well.  "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"staff were amazing, very friendly, and helpful. clean house and great location!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is a fair price considering its location, cleanliness, and incredible staff. if you can afford it, i definitely recommend it. "
Argentina,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,i loved the venice beach hostel! the staff and the owner create a beautiful environment! nice place and great area! cheers!
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything at this hostel was great! the staff is very friendly and the owner, ian, is a very cool guy. it&amp;#39;s also in a good location. i definitely recommend this place. "
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"really excellent hostel with great atmosphere and people, would recommend it to anyone."
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,i wouldn&amp;#39;t trust booking here.  i booked my four night stay at the venice beach hostel on hostel world a week in advanced.  i was told that i had a reservation.  when i arrived after a long day on a train they didn&amp;#39;t have any beds for me.  someone didn&amp;#39;t write my name in the schedule.  since it was memorial day weekend it venice beach was popping.  what if i hadn&amp;#39;t been able to find another place to stay.  i wouldn&amp;#39;t book here again unless they changed their system.
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,10,6,10,6,10,10,6,friendliest staff ever. 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,6,8,excellent place to stay. friendly staff and guests was like a home away from home. i would definitely recommend to anyone who loves a chilled vibe and good conversation with some real down to earth people. 
Germany,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,it is a nice hostel.  the staff is very friendly and helpful.  i will come back.  very good. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,4,10,10,great location and great facilities. breakfast was solid. front desk staff are so lovely and always helpful which made it hard to mark them down but did so only due to the volunteer staff who organise everything else. mostly kept to themselves i felt and weren't incredibly sociable amongst the guests 
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,8,6,"the hostel is fine. it&amp;#39;s a big house that was turned into a hostel. it&amp;#39;s like staying in a frat house. maybe this was legit, but i feel like it was not. i paid 12% of the price through hostel world as per usual. however, when i got there, the guy said &amp;#34;no you have to pay for the whole thing&amp;#34; and gave this spiel about taxes. i am pretty sure he ripped me off. if that is normal than disregard. if that is not how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be handled then shady business tactic for a few extra dollars"
Sweden,Couple,31-40,4.9,2,8,6,4,6,6,2,they didn&amp;#39;t have airport pick up.  we mailed them information about our flight number and time. got an email back that we just have to call them after we pick up our bags from the baggage claims at the airport.   so after 10 hours nightmare fligt we did and the girl sad we should have called 24 hours before arriving 😯 take the local bus.our room had a toilet and bathtube but no walls it was just an old chair to hide the toilet.   dirty carpet whit some glas so we had to wear shoes all the time.
England,Female,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,6,10,8,8,"i only stayed one night so i can&amp;#39;t comment on the environment (tho it seemed nice in a homely sort of way) but for the price i would have liked to have been handed fresh bedding as my cover didn&amp;#39;t seem fresh, i would also expect large lockers to store suitcases and to have proper door on the toilets rather than slotted doors. also $5 to pay by card and $5 to store your bags after checkout is kinda cheeky. i personally wouldn&amp;#39;t advise the place unless it&amp;#39;s your cheapest option. "
Belgium,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"very homely, nice and ideally located hostel with a great atmosphere. they currently have two different locations in a residential area near the beach and have everything you can wish for. their staff member anna even got up at 5 a.m. to order an uber to the airport for me since i&amp;#39;m travelling without a smartphone: she&amp;#39;s the best."
NewZealand,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,8,10,8,"i didn&amp;#39;t know about the no sleeping bag rule and while i was out one of the staff took it and put in a locked cupboard which was quite annoying coz i had to leave in the mornin and was quite stressed trying to figure out how to get it. maybe tell people no sleeping bags! everything else was great tho, really nice place and atmosphere"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,possibly the nicest staff my whole trip. equally happy to help or hang out with you. about a 20 min walk to the beach but worth it for price and atmosphere compared to the other venice hostels
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,10,6,6,10,10,10,6,good hostel for travellers passing through. great staff (ian the hostel owner is a legend) very helpful and insightful on the local scene.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,everyone is so friendly here and make you feel at home. there weren&amp;#39;t any locks on the room doors though but it did have the vibe you could trust everyone. the toilet and showers were a little awkward and not very private. great breakfast too.
Portugal,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.6,4,8,8,4,10,8,4,"the staff is nice, the location is good (nearby venice beach and marina del rey), the neighborhood is calm and so it looks safe. however, there were a couple of things that were disappointing for me, at least for the price ($30.00/night):  - no sheets were provided for the bed - for me, not very hygienic;  - restrooms with doors with no lock, which reduced the privacy by a lot;  - breakfast provided was very very simple (bananas, toast, coffee, milk, butter,...);  - general cleanliness"
Canada,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,"my vote seems a little low because i believe it wasn't a really good location, the staff is people actually hired when traveling and at first, when i got in, i felt like i was in an old cottage. but!!! it took 20 minutes to get over my first experience and i actually loved the experience. there are only 3 rooms so everyone gets to know each other more than in the big hostels. i would not suggest to stay there for more than 2-3 days because it's really far from everything in la."
Jamaica,Male,31-40,6.3,4,8,6,8,2,8,8,i arrived @ the venice beach hostel in the evening and was directed and by the time i woke up the next morning i was told by the owner that i was not welcome there because the hostel is only for international travelers.  i am a traveler from new york and the money i spent for the 3 night stay was returned to me by the owner of the hostel for that reason.  i felt the decision  was unjust but i was left with no choice but to move on.  i would not recommend the venice beach hostel to anyone else.
Wales,Female,41+,5.7,6,6,4,4,8,6,6,"the room was a good way from the main hostel, where breakfast was from 9am, not good if you&amp;#39;re traveling on early. also, it was right by the front door, so very noisy at night, people were sitting on the stairs right outside talking loudly, they did move when i asked them to be quiet. no bedside light or table. it&amp;#39;s a young person&amp;#39;s place."
India,Male,18-24,4.3,2,6,6,2,2,6,6,nice building ....  bad administration   rude staff   un favorable breakfast timing .....  good location ......  only one shower    i stayed here because my friend had aiready booked 
USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great staff and very nice people all around. great time met some people who i will definitely try and stay in touch with. didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about my stuff disappearing. which is always nice.
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very relaxed and peaceful. most of all safe. i would recommend this one to my closest friends. thanks.
Colombia,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the venice beach hostel is more than that, is like a shared house with a whole bunch of amazing and interesting people living all together in a tranquil community in the beautiful venice.   if you're easy going i absolutely recommend it. although it is not for everyone, if you decide to go, you will have a good time there. "
England,Couple,25-30,4.6,4,4,8,2,4,4,6,good location and big breakfast. 1 bathroom for about 20 people.
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,6,10,10,6,"the hostel itself is pretty cool. it&amp;#39;s a large converted house in a residential area. the main problem we found was that there is no signs whatsoever on the property and as we arrived late (10-11pm) there was nothing to say that the hostel was not someone&amp;#39;s home - another issue is that googlemaps takes you to a building further down the road (looks pretty empty and covered in advertisements). otherwise, staff were cool and rooms ok."
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,10,6,8,"this was my first hostel that i stayed in, and i had a good experience. the location is great since it only takes about 20 minutes to get to venice beach. i only got to interact with the morning staff and they were really helpful and understanding. there was a handful of solo travelers just like me, and it wasn't difficult to strike up a conversation with them. my only complaint would be the mattress in the 13 mixed dorm, i literally felt the box spring of the mattress poking my back. "
Japan,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i&amp;#39;ve ever stayed
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,8,4,4,6,10,6,8,wasn&amp;#39;t expecting a house airbnb setup  was a different location to which we booked  staff were very helpful 
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved venice beach hostel! i found that even though i was in la, the hostel was great value for money and being on a travellers budget that was well helpful. every member of staff are awesome, real friendly and make you feel right at home. fab communal areas, great for meeting other backpackers.  and its in a rad location, 10mins or so walk to venice beach. top hostel x"
Netherlands,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the main building on yale st, was very nice good atmosphere. bed was a bit bounsy but i was very tired of my trip so sleeping was no problem. a lot of the stuff is old and outdated bad.  the shower was great. e breakfast was super, got more than the hotels were i stayed  the second place were i stayed was on wasington blv, was nice but also a bit ""under construction"" not bad but for the breakfast you needed tpo go to the main building."
AmericanSamoa,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,love the place  . will stay again . 
Denmark,Male,25-30,6.6,6,4,8,6,8,8,6,"make sure to ask the hostel about airport pick-up before booking (if that's important for you), because sometimes they're not able to pick you up - even within the announced time period. otherwise friendly staff. not much privacy in the 13-people dorm - but who could expect that."
Sweden,Couple,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,10,8,6,"alright hostel. a nice place to hang out. it was a big house with a lot off beds. only two toilets in the house to share with around 30 people. very soft beds, and i didn't like that they didn't wash the blankets in the beds between stays. but overall a nice place to hang out at."
Poland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel, well situated, 20 min to venice beach on foot, markets in neighborhood. great stuff. big rooms, clean toilets, breakfast included."
USA,Couple,41+,7.1,6,10,6,6,10,6,6,our room was remodeled and nice. one of the window blinds was getting hard to operate. i forgot to tell the staff that. the entrance where the office is  could be remodeled. it doesn't look that good when you first go in. they could consider getting better couches for the day room also. but overall we really  enjoyed our time.   the atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly!
India,Male,31-40,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,"on the checkout day while i was having breakfast i was told-"" u need to vacate the room at 10 as we need to change sheets.you know how it works,right""   i was never informed of this rule during checkin and i felt it was really rude to say so and do so without prior information.and yes i do not know how it works unless u tell me in advance."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,4,6,8,6,8,8,8,"pretty hard and confusing to find, but got there in the end. way too expensive for what you get but i guess one of the only options. they only have one parking spot which is annoying too. nice kitchen  and staff. fair bike ride down to the boardwalk and any shops. okay for a night"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best place i&amp;#39;ve been in playa del rey area and i cannot ask for more, close to in&amp;out, costco, awesome chinese restaurant, walgreen, liquor store, lots of smart people to learn from such as spacex and google. i recommend, i felt at home"
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,6,8,6,10,10,8,"i really liked this hostel. it was so welcoming and totally friendly. i would highly recommend going here, and i would definitely go again."
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is a house so more like a air b n b feel than a hostel . couldn't fault it . perfect for 2 nights
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,6,10,10,6,pretty chill hostel close to venice beach. felt kind of more like a airbnb place because it is just like a house in which everybody is living together. however i really enjoyed my stay and i would recommend this hostel to anybody who wants to spend some days in la and doesn't mind sleeping in a bigger dorm together with other travellers.
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,10,8,"really lovely hostel with lovely staff and charming character to the hostel itself, definitely from the old school of hostels and a welcoming homely feel with books and games which personally i prefer to flashier more clinical modern hostels. ian welcomed me and helped me with directions and it had everything i needed, and a cup of tea :)"
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever! the staff was super friendly and accommodating.
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,my friend and i stayed here nye and had a great time chatting with the staff and other travelers. we really enjoyed he lounge area and it's laid back vibe.  i would definitely stay here again.
USA,Male,25-30,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,its was the worst hostel i've ever been! and it was different from what we saw in the website and the room was so dirty and there was bugs in the bathroom!     im not satisfied at all.
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,6,4,6,4,6,10,4,"when i first walked into this hostel, i was ecstatic - it looked like a warm, family-like crowd, the hostel was basically like a giant house, and everything was extremely laid back and alternative. however, security is practically non-existent (you charge us $5 to keep our bag on a pool table in plain view? seriously?), dorm room is incredible mess, no a/c or heating,  staff is kinda random, and it's a solid 30-min walk to venice beach. thank god was only there for 1 night."
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,had a wonderful stay thank you for being such lovely welcoming people and making me feel right at home!!!
Canada,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,6,4,6,"the hostel on the whole was decent but we were relocated to their other location which was a remarkable disappointment as it was dingy and had an overall unpleasant atmosphere. the bedroom had a bad smell with old creaky bunk beds, the kitchen was unequipped with basic utensils. if you decide to stay here please request that you not get booked at their other location which looks like they got it right after some untidy person abandoned it all of a sudden."
India,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,6,8,6,8,"the ensuite room had a toilet literally inside the room, without a door. the showers were shared only and are not in the room for private use. there was a jacuzzi tub in the room which was practically unusable because of the lack of heating in room. also, the hostel is actually a few blocks farther from the beach as compared to the address shown on website and in online booking. that made it very difficult to walk to the beach. also, there is no mention that they charge for payment by card."
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,6,10,6,8,didnt stay in main place but a house converted off washington.blvd. its very homey but its an old hous so dont expect modern comforts but more country lodge type deccor.and atmosphere. cannot fault staff they were.   lovely. day fee and luggage storage on top of already expencive room fee is charged. not sure how routine this is for usa. beds not too comfortable. not sure i would stay again for the same money. but then again it is la?!
Mexico,Male,25-30,7.1,6,6,8,6,8,8,8,"close to venice beach (15min walk) and one block away from bus stops. it's a house converted into a hostel so expect facilities according.  nice and confortable, very friendly people, breakfast it's good and very complete, toasted bread and cereal, some fruit, milk and orange juice."
USA,Female,41+,5.4,2,6,8,4,8,6,4,"i admit that i booked this stay in a hurry after a stressful change of plans. excited to find private room with shared bath for $45/night. didn't realize it was per bed &amp; i would be charged for unoccupied bed as well, nor that the $35 ""deposit"" was really an additional fee would not be deducted from my total. i would never have paid $100+/night for a dirty room (i vacuumed the toenail clippings &amp; other detritus), above the smoking hangout, w/hairy shower, &amp; empty tp. staff nice but inflexible."
England,Male,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,the staff are fantastic and the location is great but the room had no curtains and the bathroom had no locks so you would be in the shower whilst someone was in the toilet. i would stay again but this is not a hostel for anyone afraid of a commune style vibe.
England,Male,31-40,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,"nice place, staff super friendly and helpful. it is a 20-25min walk to the beach but that doesn't bother me my diet goes out the window when on holiday so the extra walking is a good thing or you can hire a bike and no issue. highly recommend you cycle between santa monica and venice beach during your stay."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,8,8,10,8,6,"thank you anna for the great effort of explaining the things to do, place to visit and food to eat. it was really a good place to stay where the staffs were very friendly and they do introduce good places to visits and invite guest to great place to hang out together. good job!!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"it was awesome staying at the venice beach hostel! the staff was honestly amazing, very nice people at the hostel. the facility had a very familiar atmosphere and i felt welcome immediately."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"if you want a friendly environment with an abundance of cultural and welcoming people, then this is the place for you. i felt welcomed the second i walked in and i've made memories with them that i'll remember for the rest of my life."
Germany,Male,25-30,7.7,8,4,8,6,10,10,8,ayou will find a very nice crew there. nicest hostel staff i ever met. felt like family after just a few hours.
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"great, relaxed atmosphere."
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this was my first hostel experience and i would definitely go back! my main concerns were bed bugs but i saw nothing like that or anything else that grossed me out. of course the bedding/towels weren't brand new, but everything was very well maintained. ian knew my name from the first phone call i made to the hostel, and other staff members were just as attentive. the people i met there really added to my experience. i now have friends all over the world. :)"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i can not speak higher of this hostel. i have stayed in hostels all over the continental us and this one has become one of my favorite stays. the owner could not be any nicer or any more hands with his buildings. i will be staying here in the future and would recommend it to anybody staying in in venice beach area.
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay, friendly people.    just don't confuse with similarly named hostel near the beach and could use a sign out the front."
Sweden,MixedGroup,25-30,5.7,4,4,8,4,10,6,4,felt temporary
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,8,6,"the place is a good deal for a a few days with a low budget. the atmosphere was ok, the staff (the russian girl) was very helpfull. the place is a little bit to far from the beach, maybe 20 min walking or more, it could be closer, but had a nice stay."
Slovenia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"it was really nice, the breakfast area is great."
Mexico,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,the staff were very friendly and respectful. i arrived after 11:30 pm and they were accepting and friendly. they helped me with my bags and helped me with information about what to see in la. the hostel vibe is awesome and the people were amazing.
England,MixedGroup,18-24,4.3,2,4,6,4,4,4,6,we turned up and there was a man laying on the couch who told us he worked there but it was his day off so couldn't check us in. we had to awkwardly wait with this man for 30 mins until a woman who was working arrived. we were shown to our cramped room with mattresses on the floor (not beds) with a small fan in the corner of a very hot room. there was one mixed bathroom with no locks on doors with two showers for over 30 people on the top floor.  games room was a dingy garage with no games.
Turkey,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,8,8,10,8,10,"atmosphere was really good. everything was perfectly working such as lockerz, wifi, etc. location is also good. it only takes 10-15 min to go to beach on foot. there are bus stops close to the place. i recommend this place. it worths."
Brazil,Male,31-40,4.9,4,8,6,2,6,4,4,"the address in the website is wrong and they don´t provide any fans for the hottest nights, much noise and the say they have parking but the parking is on the street."
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, 15 minute walk from the beach (can also hire bicycles)cheapest hostel in venice! the staff were really friendly and approachable, the facilities are clean. the best hostel we found in la! would highly recommend."
Australia,Female,31-40,4.6,4,2,6,2,6,8,4,"no locks on bathroom doors so it's free for all to come in. 2 showers and 2 toilets between 18 people. no safe space to lock up your bags. bunk bed felt like the were going to fall to bits, so people were moving mattress on to space on the floors. felt like a bit of make shift attempt of a hostel."
Colombia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic! this hostel rocked my socks. their location was in a central area, easy to access buses, transport to the airport, close to the beach and the famous venice beach boardwalk. there are loads of hole in the wall and swanky bars around for whatever your tastes are for a good night out also! of course, i have to mention, their staff was on par. absolutely friendly and so so helpful with everything! you will not regret your stay here one bit!"
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,10,6,"this hostel is awesome. such a great, chilled out vibe. it doesn't feel like a hostel at all. everyone is social and more often than not you'll find yourself hanging out with people you met earlier that day! i've stayed here twice and if i ever return to la i will staying again! there are lockers (bring a padlock), the kitchen is available for use, breakfast in the mornings. it's a $1 bus ride away from the airport and the beach is a 15min walk away. thoroughly recommend to social people!"
England,Female,18-24,4.3,4,4,2,6,6,4,4,"we got to the address that was on the website which isn't where the hostel actually is so we ended up walking a mile after looking online for the hostel and see there are 2, when we get there it's not the right one, he gives us the real address of the place we are suppose to be staying and we get a bus back. after an hour and a half we get there and it turns out it's a house. the beds are uncomfortable the bathroom is a family bathroom with one shower and one toilet with no real privacy."
England,Male,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,6,4,6,6,"excellent location. my partner and i stayed in the twin bed private on washington blvd, facilities were sufficient and clean. staff are accodating enough but i was told i could park on oxford avenue (next to washington blvd) and i ended up getting a $63 due to road sweeping the day after i arrived in the country."
India,Male,25-30,3.1,2,2,6,2,6,2,2,the place is not at all good to live. they stuff the crappy rooms with about 10 people. the rooms are somehow crappy. toilets are not good at all.
Italy,Male,18-24,3.7,2,2,6,2,8,4,2,"helpfuo staff, but it it's nit a real hostel it's just some kind of appartment for up to 14 people with just 1 bathroom, it's a bit far too far to the beach to be named ""beach hostel"" 20 min walk to the beach, very old bunk beds, it's ok if you don't expect nothing but otherwise it's not worth the money+ they charge you 15$ for buying by credit card!!"
Ireland,Female,31-40,6,4,8,4,6,8,6,6,for the price it really wasn't very good. beds need new matresses.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,warm &amp; welcoming staff with respectful guests. positive energy in a casual social setting.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,5.1,2,6,6,2,8,6,6,"we checked in to a 6 bed dorm, with no air conditioner, no fans, so hot we had to have windows open, with cars/trucks driving down the main road at all hours of the night, resulting in next to no sleep, it was extremely hot and uncomfortable without anything to keep us cool, the bunk beds felt like they were going to break considering how unstable they were, a pull out bed blocked the the entrance to the room, meaning we had to squeeze in and out of the dorm, the toilet didnt flush."
England,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"excellent location for the beach and felt very safe. the facilities are however a bit unclean and it would be nice to shower with some more privacy but as a young female it never felt unsafe. very relaxed environment, it may have been the timing but after socialising loads in previous hostels people kept themselves to themselves here."
Spain,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"the bunks are not the best, but the house is charming, and the place safety and full of live. love it!"
Germany,AllMaleGroup,25-30,4,4,4,8,2,4,4,2,"good breakfast, location was alright, but  it's actually not really close to the beach. the beds were totally worn out and almost all the facilities were moldy and dirty. our room was very small. we had a window directly to a busy street, but there was no possibility to completely close it, which made the room very noisy. no air conditioning was available. staff varied between friendly and creepy. we did not feel comfortable at any moment and felt quite insecure in addition. stay somewhere else!"
Australia,Male,18-24,3.4,2,4,4,4,2,6,2,this place was pretty grimy and quite far away from venice beach. it was overpriced and mediocre.
Mexico,Male,25-30,3.1,2,6,2,2,4,4,2,dirty and uncomfortable. definitely not a nice experience.
Sweden,MixedGroup,18-24,5.7,6,6,6,4,6,8,4,"this hostel is ok if you're staying for one or two nights, but i wouldn't recommend a longer stay. the atmosphere was nice but compared to other hostels this didn't offer clean towels or bedding,  there was no ac, the madrasses felt dirty and  completely worn out."
Switzerland,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,i think the main hostel (yale) is pretty much cooler
USA,Male,31-40,8,6,10,10,6,10,8,6,iain was super helpful.
USA,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"i am an american student backpacking around my own country and i have been staying in hostels always, i booked this hostel when the l was in los angeles and when i got there they refused to let me stay, they said they don't allow americans and they never returned my deposit money."
Ireland,Male,18-24,5.7,6,4,6,4,8,8,4,"the lovely staff failed to make up for the extensive flaws. whilst the communal kitchen and living areas were fine, the bed was the worst i've stayed in - no barrier for the top bunk combined with a very low quality mattress and bed frame meant it never felt like a safe sleep.     this is a review for the overflow property on yale avenue, which is further from the beach than the one advertised, though it is still walkable."
Germany,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"a good hostel especially for younger travelers. many students from all around the world. always something going on.  even if the location is announced as 716 washington blvd, i had no problem to find the correct location (yale ave) for check-in (got an email right after the booking). venice beach is a almost 20 min walk and lax 30 min by bus."
USA,Male,25-30,8,10,8,6,6,10,8,8,"clean place,  strange location with a hobo hang out outside. heard them shouting all night. staff is super cool and friendly. big confusion with the ""other"" location. "
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,5.7,4,6,6,6,8,6,4,"the hostel was passable, but not ideal. i wouldn't have liked to stay there for more than one night. the address given on the hostel was not where we were actually supposed to go - please change it to the yale avenue address! the 13-bed dorm was very crowded, and became smelly through the night, and people were not that considerate about coming in late and making noise.  however, the service was very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was nice."
Ireland,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"helpful staff, clean hostel and nice location"
Belgium,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,8,6,8,4,4,"this hostel has 2 locations (one close to the beach, the other a 20min walk from the beach). the 2 locations makes it more difficult to create a good environment with great ambiance. the beds were old and are due to renew. but every person gets new sheets which was good. the bathroom needed a good clean(water and sand all over the floor). i think that if this hostel was located in only one place, it would have made my stay a lot better. it felt more as renting an apartment for a few nights."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,10,6,the staff were all amazing and so friendly.
Netherlands,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,all good! ian is a great guy. thanks for having me ;)
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,8,6,10,8,8,"excellent staff, very friendly and helpful."
Australia,Female,25-30,5.1,6,4,6,6,4,4,6,no lockers in or near the dorms. i was in the second location which is closer to 30 than 15 minutes walk from the beach. the place is a bit scruffy. and it costs $5 to leave your bag in the unlocked garage for a day after you check out.
Australia,Male,18-24,3.7,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,"""the venice beach hostel"" (this hostel) and ""venice beach hostel"" are two completely different hostels. the venice beach hostel isn't even located to venice beach, it's in marina del rey. why the pictures of venice beach? it's  a good 25 minute walk to the beach. also, they moved us to ""the other hostel"". my rating is of the ""other hostel"". it's a old unit which has been coverted into a one bedroom (6 beds) and a single private. this wasn't even a hostel!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,great location for getting busses and trains into hollywood and la.  also not too far from disney.   stayed at the 2nd location on yale avenue which was a 15min walk or more to venice and muscle beach.  chilled out relaxed atmosphere safe area  great stay
Austria,Female,18-24,6,4,6,8,4,8,8,4,"so the staff was really nice and helpful all the time and they gave good advices for trips all around los angeles. nevertheless in my opinion towels would be needed in the bathroom for drying hands, the toilets smelled bad and the blankets seemed not to be washed for every new traveler (either they should be washed every time or they should use sheets/covers)."
Denmark,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,nice and quiet but a bit far from the main activities. great staff and clean rooms.
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,everything was good ! the hostel us nice ans zen and 20 min to walk for the beach   thank you so much !!   xxx
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,friendly and helpful staff regarding the area and things to do. pleasant stay. bathrooms a bit lacking in privacy for the female travelers.
Canada,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,while there are things that are rustic in nature i love the atmosphere of this place. people are laid back and there is a hominess to the facility. after staying in a few other hostels this one remains my best pick out of all of them.
USA,Couple,41+,5.7,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,we booked a private room with bathroom and it was not disclosed that it was without a shower. also the location of hostel is not clear we thought we booked closer to the ocean but when we arrived they said the only private wasd at the other hostel further away.
Australia,Female,25-30,4.3,4,2,6,2,4,6,6,you can not even lock the shower as it just has a curtain. there were not ladders to the top bunk.
Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"good breakfast, nice staff"
Italy,Couple,18-24,7.4,6,6,10,6,8,8,8,"great location - 10 min walk to venice beach. double room was extremely simple and located in the other building on washington (main bld is on yale). this location is less crowded so probably cleaner and quieter, but the main house feels more ""homey"", also the majority of the guests stay there so more people to hang out with. breakfast is great and the bike rental is very cheap. ian the owner is super cool and kind. overall great atmosphere but expensive for what you get with the double room."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a wonderful stay. got picked up straight from the airport! it's in a great location, there are 2 venice beach hostels which can be a bit confusing- that's my only criticism. the people are so friendly and helpful. thanks ian for answering all our questions! there are lockers (bring your own lock) and in terms of security i felt safe in the hostel. kitchen is all you expect and the free breakfast is very nice. big shared bathroom, good price, would stay again. sarah and loretta"
Netherlands,Male,18-24,7.7,10,2,8,10,8,6,10,"nice, but basic hostel. not that close to the sea."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great stay, 10 minute walk to the venice beach awesome bars and shops close by, great kitchen for cooking for your self. ian the owner is very helpful and great chat. definitely recomend to anyone looking to fully enjoy their time in la "
Switzerland,Female,25-30,6,4,6,4,4,8,8,8,"attention: this hostel is not at the venice beach!! when i booked and checked on google maps it showed it would be right next to the beach. in addition to that they just transfered me to another hostel (first they said it would only be for check in) which turned out to be in a calm neighbourhood, about 30 minutes walk to the beach (the hostel staff kept saying 15 minutes which is absolutely not true, i talked to other people in the hostel). i wouldn't recommend this hostel honestly."
Switzerland,MixedGroup,25-30,3.7,2,2,6,2,4,8,2,"the hostel was one of the worst we've ever been. the address mentioned on the website of hostelword.com was not possible to find. we drove around more than 2 hours. after we had the right address they did not have all our reservations. they gave us additional mattresses but no blankets. it was a joke. in the morning, we found the most terrible bathroom. the shower was for men and women but no key to close the door. and the shower curtain was grey from dirt. just terrible! dont go there!!!!"
England,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,"it took me four hours to find this hostel - inc. 2 buses &amp;2 taxis - 1 taxi gave up trying to find the hostel. the address on website doesn't exist. when i checked in although it was 2am the hostel employee was drunk. he didn't have my booking despite me showing my hostelworld reservation. he told me the hostel was full and ""made me a spot"" which was a very thin foam mattress with a sheet over it on the bare floor under a staircase and charged me $30.the lady working in morning was very rude."
England,Couple,18-24,2.9,4,4,2,2,2,2,4,"despite airport pick up advertised this was not available on our stay which was disappointing. we booked a private double with ensuite which turned out to be 2 camp beds with a bathtub and toilet in the same room - not what we were expecting! staff not particularly friendly or helpful - unable to provide recommendations. also location wise, at least a 25 min walk to venice beach and not too much around the hostel itself. wouldn't recommend. "
Wales,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,friendly staff . hosel in a convenient and safe location
Israel,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a great place! very welcoming, nice staff, feels like home (:"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,lovely staff and other people there. this place is cozy and has a nice setup to encourage folks to chat with each other.
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"ian, the host, is a great guy.  the location is all right, not right on the beach, but close enough.    on the other hand, if you're a us citizen (not ""international""), they're not sure if they want you.   it does explain that on their site, but it's fine print.    also, as others have mentioned,  the address is confusing.   in the gps, the place is marina del rey, not venice beach.       but regardless, it's a great place and as i say, ian is first rate."
Germany,Male,25-30,4.9,2,4,6,4,6,6,6,"welcome was the worst of stay,with reservation i got message to check-in at another site,later we also had to sleep there!no keys for rooms!hard to find sites-no signs that make you recognize that these are ""hostels"".also in afternoon there was nobody to welcome us.breakfast is ok,but all sites are not of common standard-price-performance ratio=really bad! also charged us more than said in hostelworld email!!  sorry but do not understand who made the other comments here on hostelworld!"
Netherlands,Female,18-24,7.4,6,6,8,6,10,8,8,"the staff of this hostel is one of the best i've ever seen. they are helpful, really kind and they make you feel at home. this hostel is more like an old house, so that gives something special to the atmosphere, it's nice. the furniture is quite old, especially the beds/mattresses. they should really think about new matesses, because it's not good for your back.   the breakfast is nice and the neighbourhood is nice, it's safe to go outside (also at night)."
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.6,6,8,6,4,8,6,8,"it is not a real hostel, it is a old house with a place to sleep. the private room is inside tha bathroom. to be very honest, it is expensive for what it is. just for sleep is ok."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice, relaxing hostel in a great area! the staff are great, very helpful."
Brazil,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"the hostel is pretty nice. it's a big house that now is a hostel. the location is very good to. the staff were friendly. i had a great stay there. the mattress could be a little more comfortable, but it was ok."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.3,4,6,6,6,6,8,8,"15-20 min from the beach, clean, but crowded room and only two showers and toilets  breakfast alright, kitchen and living room nice  too expensive for what you get, old beds and uncomfortable mattresses, little weird that the staff sleeps in same room  deposit actually a fee (so you still have to pay the whole amount when you arrive, unless you already have paid a deposit to hostelworld...)"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, lovely, helpful people. perfect stay. many thanks "
Brazil,Male,25-30,6,2,6,8,4,8,6,8,"the bathrooms have no lock, there were only locks for the toylet part.  i was not wake for the rush hours of the bathroom, but i think that it would not be enough. we even got the private room with bathroom, with consists of one big room with one toylet and one tub, no doors separating anything, no shower."
Malaysia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i liked this place so much the first time around, that when i had to go back to la, i decided to stay here again. that pretty much says everything about the hostel."
Brazil,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,4,4,2,2,4,"the hostel doesn't have a reception area, no towels for free, no paper or towel to dry hands in the bathrooms, no heater in the dorms and hostel (which is bad during the winter), no living room to play games. the hostel is far from the beach. no cool and cheap places to go near the hostel. the staff is weird. they don't like to do the things with technology and they have non sense rules."
Germany,Female,25-30,6.9,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,"only one bathroom with one toilet for an apartment for 10 guests can be pretty difficult. its been also damn cold in the rooms, because you cant really close all windows. ok, maybe california in december isnt such a good idea, but anyway, freezing at night with a paid roof over the head is sad. but to be fair: the furniture and location is pretty good :)"
Spain,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's a really good hostel, it's like family house. the location is perfect for that people that want to visit venice beach and santa monica. the staff is nice, the help you in all you need and the treat you in a really friendly way. i had a good experience in this hostel so i recommend it to every traveler "
Malaysia,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,staff were lovely and it's a real cosy place to stay. it's 15 minutes away from the beach (there's another one nearer to the beach but we were put up here instead because the other one was full) and close to a grocery store and bars.
Sweden,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,10,8,"fantastic atmosphere, nice personel. had a great time!"
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,this place has two addresses most likely you will not be able to check in with the listed address. make sure to check your emails!! staff were helpful and the area is good and it's easy to get to the airport!
Switzerland,Couple,31-40,4,2,8,6,2,4,2,4,"we had our problems even in finding the hostel reception because the room was in a different building, half a mile away. they provide free parking, but it's the 2-hour-parking next to the street (we had a ticket after). the price is much too high for this shabby room (very small and unheatened). the bathroom was dirty with a carpet soaked up with water. when we talked to the employees there, they were not at all reasonable. a very bad deal (we are long term travellers and saw a lot of hostels)."
Canada,Male,31-40,2.9,2,4,6,2,2,2,2,"the kitchen is terribly dirty, microwave has 3 years worth of food in it. i had to change arrival dates and this angered the hostel owner, i could understand that if the hostel was at capacity, but it was empty. not a pleasant experience."
Japan,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,6,4,10,8,10,"when i stayed here, hot shower was broken!! so i could use only cold shower;(. but the staff is kind:). this is a nice hostel."
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,some people might not like it but i think that the fact that the hostel is set in what it looks like a big house makes it really cozy and welcoming. staff is very helpful and kind and i didn't have any issues with dirt or anything like that. my stay was very pleasant and i made some really nice traveling memories there. the breakfast is good and the laundry machines have a fair price. i recommend it to anyone! 
Finland,Male,31-40,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,10,6,"hostel has a very great and relaxed atmosphere, and it's wonderfully located just a 10 minute walk away from venice beach."
Germany,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,6,6,10,8,6,"the staff is outstanding and very welcoming! the way they have greeted me and went out of their way to show me the highlights of the surrounding, can definitely make a difference when staying in a new city! thanks for that..."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was great everything you need and more with breakfast and friendly staff. iain the boss was great very funny english man, i had a great stay !!! see you guys soon "
Brazil,Male,31-40,3.4,4,6,6,2,2,2,2,"i bought one privete room with privete bath, and the room has no shower and the sanitare vase in the midle of the room. totaly digusting!!!!  i had to transpass into the other room to reach my room!!! is this private????? very bad!!!! "
Sweden,Female,25-30,8,8,6,6,6,10,10,10,very cosy place. like a small house where good people meet and hang out:-) slept both in the private room in the main house and in the dorm. decided to have a few days extra there since the place was so good. really friendly staff as well. recommended:)
Germany,Couple,25-30,3.7,2,4,2,4,6,4,4,"location was not as expected. the room was very tiny and not value that price. the kitchen was well equiped but in total the place was pretty used. it was far away from the beach. they also run two facilities, so you have to run from one to another to get breakfast or to get access to the laundry. before booking try to make sure the room is in yale ave because regarding the facilities it's the more convenient one, but it's more far to the beach. you have pay an extra charge for credit card. "
Sweden,Male,25-30,6.6,8,2,8,8,6,6,8,"the hostel is in a good location, close to a grocery store, several restaurants and car rentals.  the bathroom and kitchen were okay and kept clean. the laundry room was also functional. to use the washing machine it cost $2 and the dryer $1.5 which is not too bad.   the only negative thing to say, is that the owner is phishy. he seems friendly, but he rips off travelers and blames hostelworld. after paying the deposit online, he demands full payment though you have paid a sum already. "
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,everything was great besides these 3 things.    1. wifi would not always work  2. bed feels like they are going to fall to pieces   3. not alot of privacy in the bathrooms.     but you get what you pay for. i enjoyed my stay.
Australia,Female,41+,5.7,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,"hostel world confirmation didn't include sufficient information for us to find the hostel. there are two locations and neither is marked or signposted in anyway, and you are required to check in at only one site so if your room is at the other it is another 4 block walk back.we were told that a follow up email is usually sent with more detailed instructions but we received no such email. and booking at short notice there may not be time to receive it before you are on your way. very frustrating!"
USA,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,6,6,8,6,"this place was ok... a bed to sleep in and a hot shower, but the woman on shift when i went to shower didn't know where the key was for the towel closet and i had to dry off using other clothes i bought. the bed above me was also extremely loud when another girl in the room could not sleep at night. the woman than checked me in was very knowledgeable and pleasant and the location felt safe which was important. "
Sweden,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the worst place i ever statyed at, the adress were wrong so got to a ""house"" first and then we had to walk to another house. in there it was so dirty and small. it couldnt been cleaned there for weeks. the window had no glass and it everything was so bad. we couldnt stay for an hour. never book this place!!!   it worst than hell!"
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,it was a nice hostel. it was really hard to find as it just looks like a house no sign outside. they had a really great breakfast. 
France,Couple,25-30,7.7,2,10,10,10,10,10,2,very nice place.  little bit dirty and huge fees if you décide to pay by credit card
Bulgaria,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,very good place in santa monica. it's full with young people. fully recomend :)
Russia,Female,18-24,8,10,8,8,8,8,6,8,"this hostel is very comfortable for students. it's really not expensive, nice atmosphere and clean place, also near the beach and excellent view of the pacific ocean. thanks a lot for everything."
Denmark,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,"just brilliant!    i don't really understand, why other people haven't enjoyed their stay at venice beach hostel.  my friend and i, who stayed there, found it just brilliant.  staff was nice and in general, people there just were.    so all in all i have nothing to say but to go there if you need a place to stay in venice. and it doesn't really matter, what so ever, that they put 9 beds in the 8 bed room. you only need the place to sleep."
England,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,8,6,6,nice relaxing household environment
Canada,Male,25-30,4.6,4,2,6,4,6,6,4,"we arrived and had booked for three nights after arriving i told the staff we would only stay one night we asked for our money back for the third night following their 48hr return policy, she said to speak to the manager in am. the manager in the am told us it was not possible as it was now  past the 48 hrs. the hostel room wreaked of b.o .there was no visible front counter, the internet was slow to non existent. we stayed out as late as possible to avoid sleeping there upon return at 4am no loc"
Germany,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,10,10,10,6,excellent atmosphere .. met very cool people .. 
Canada,Female,18-24,3.4,2,2,6,2,2,8,2,"the prices being charged to stay here are absurd. they had two locations, mine had one bathroom for almost 15 people. no hand towels or paper towels in the kitchen or bathroom. one of the guys came to clean and he literally just wiped things to make it look clean. they don't mention that they want you to pay in cash and if you don't they will charge like $10 to use your visa. both locations are run down. the beds were so unstable that one guy had to put his mattress on the floor to sleep."
England,Male,18-24,3.4,2,4,2,6,2,6,2,"the place was very neglected. the kitchen had ants crawling all over the surfaces and in the cupboards. the beds were really outdated, i ended up falling out of mine during the night twice and was forced to sleep on the floor, i told a member of staff and he said choose another bed, but that was also very unstable. the hostel doesn't state that there is another location where you must first check in, half a mile down the road!"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,nice place to chill out. close to the beach and all of the venice beach area. also quite close to funky cafés and bars. staff are super friendly and helpful. 
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,10,4,6,"ian was amazing, really knowledgable about bus routes and things to do in the area, however the facilities and location are not good enough to justify the price. "
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,"ian was awesome, super helpful and knowledgeable, however the rooms were crowded and lacked security."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, has a great atmosphere met lots of other nice travellers. never review hostels but because the staff were so friendly felt i owe them to return the favour. ian one of the staff is a legend."
Austria,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"good location, nice staff, had a great time there! "
Wales,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my first time visiting a hostel my mind had taken a different picture. when i arrived i was greeted by a friendly crowd of hostel goers and then to a staff member, ian. probably the only reason i had stayed in america as long as i did. great walk to the beach, local amenities with 7/11 being 5 minutes away. as well as fast food chains. cheap laundry services and 1 dollar coca colas. bonus. would recommend this location to anyone!"
NewZealand,MixedGroup,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"staff were friendly, especially ian and gave us directions. always had time for our questions.   lovely breakfast."
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"location was great, less than a mile from the beach. staff were always very friendly and extremely helpful. bedroom, living-room, kitchen, and bathroom were also very nice and comfortable. absolutely no complaints whatsoever, could not ask for a nicer hostel."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"my stay at the beach hostel in venice was awesome. even though it was only a couple of days we definitely made the most of it. staff were very welcoming. cheers, james"
Sweden,Male,25-30,7.7,10,2,10,8,8,8,8,"you get what you pay for. cheap, great location, polite and easy going staff. "
Chile,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,6,8,8,6,"all in all, a decent place.  it is decently located for la standards, pretty close to venice beach (everything else is at least an hour away), staff were friendly and willing to help when needed, there were lots of young guests from all over the globe which gave it a nice atmosphere.  on the downside. there were only 2 unisex toilets and showers for the entire hostel. there was not a lot of privacy if you wanted to shower or go #2. also, the doors were wide open all day which felt kind if unsafe"
France,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,i read very bad reviews about this hostel the first time before to book it but now i can tell that it was a great place to stay with a staff always ready to help you. moreover it was clean.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,10,8,"had an amazing stay and the venice beach hostel, great staff and awesome travellers were staying here which made it lots of fun. only down fall was that someone had stolen some clothes that we had left to dry on the balcony of one of the dorm rooms. not the hostels fault but really was a downer of the trip"
Switzerland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved my stay at venice beach hostel (even came back after a short trip to catalina island). the atmosphere is friendly, the staff is very helpful and nice, everything is very clean and cozy. it´s not a party hostel it´s more of a feeling of coming home while traveling.  the location is pretty good as well: 20 min walk to the beach and a lot of buses around the corner which take you almost everywhere.  would definitely stay there again!"
Canada,Male,25-30,4,6,4,8,2,2,4,2,"only one is positive : the location !   the security:any one can gets in and one without being disturbed / staff (shift night): a way behind expected. the guy didn't know that i paid a deposit and have me paying the full price for two nights, and charged me 5$ for using a visa card/ the motel is dirty, and the kitchen is disgusting, the walls are creepy. the rooms were stuffed with people and stuff all over the floor, i had truble getting to my bed. no plugs in the rooms  not recommended!!"
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,6,10,10,6,"the staff were great, very helpful and kind. the hostel had a home vib to it which i enjoyed. the other guests were really nice. the location is good, close to grocery shopping and convenience. it's not the cleanest hostel i've been to but i still really enjoyed me self! thank y'all :)"
England,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,as of summer 2014 this address is not correct. took a taxi to the address listed here and there was nothing there. this was at 3am in la. tried calling them and they gave me poor directions to another address! never even got there and had to sleep rough on my first night in los angeles! 
Sweden,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,"the staff was super specelly ian :) helpt you out wothe whatever u needed. he also knew everyboodys name staying at the hostel if just for one night.   liked that it wasnt screaming here we have a hostel.   /swedes staying    all and all absolutley worth the moeney. specilly thanks to ian! the downside was the kitchen, lots of flys."
Australia,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,we felt unsafe the whole time. the beds were falling apart and there was little to no security 
Chile,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,very good hostel
Sweden,Couple,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,we chose to stay at friends place instead and left venice beach hostel after just a few hours. my mistake not to read the   reviews before booking this place - they all seem to be true.
Germany,Male,31-40,6,6,8,8,2,8,6,4,the dorm is extremely crowded and the beds are old and filthy. limited bathrooms and shower facilities. friendly staff. cheap place to stay but nothing else redeeming.
Australia,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,do not stay here!!! there simply isn't enough space in this comment box to express how disgusted we were with the place! it's an absolute disgrace!
France,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"miss one thing in this youth hotel, one phone who working.."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,6,10,10,10,10,"the staff were extremely friendly, very nice atmosphere, feels like a home more then a hostel."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"cool place, nice people and a great place to stay"
Norway,Male,31-40,6,6,6,4,6,8,6,6,wrong location. the new address had a nice neighborhood with a local pub that i liked. had turtle race in the backyard of the pub. haven't seen that before.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"i loved this hostel!! it has a great atmosphere and everyone is so lovely. the staff are like your friends and it really feels like a big home. whilst the facilities are nothing flashy, they are clean and comfortable.  i stayed at the house that was further away from the beach. it was about a 15 minute walk so we rented bikes from them. recommend renting bikes anyway so you can go up to santa monica. was very sad to leave and can't wait to go back sometime. would eagerly recommend this hostel."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,6,8,6,10,8,10,staff were all really friendly and helpful and kitchen had great facilities with really good breakfast. bathrooms were clean with good showers and we didn't have any issues in waiting for them but i can see how that could be a problem. there were quite a few mattresses on the floor where people had to sleep on which i wouldn't be happy about!! location isn't bad but the address on hostel world is wrong which meant we spent an hour walking around trying to find it! not signposted at all...
Poland,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,it's really not a good place to stay in la
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"can't complain here, great location, great people, great cheap eats in the area to"
France,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,6,8,8,this hostel is vert nice it looks like a house but everything is open and they have only 2 mixed bathrooms it's not convenient and annoying ..the location is very good !
France,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this is the worst hostel i have ever been in. the staff is unfriendly, all the doors open and the rooms very dirty. i caught bedbuks there!"
England,Couple,25-30,6,4,8,6,4,6,4,10,"stayed during a busy period so were told that we were staying at the 'overflow' location. it was the one advertised but, it was basically just a flat with 2 long term stayers so really it just felt like we were encroaching on their space. only 1 toilet/ shower room so getting access to it was hard work with 6 people staying here. free breakfast and all other advertised facilities are at the other location. no atmosphere. some staff were nice, mostly we just felt in the way. not worth the price."
Switzerland,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,8,4,8,8,6,the staff were very friendly and helpful. my friend and me slept together in one bed it was small and very uncomfortable. there were only two bathrooms for approx. 26 persons.
Canada,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,8,6,8,4,6,this is a party hostel. if you want to have a good nights sleep to get up at a decent time the next morning this is not the place for you. the outside common area is directly below the rooms so it can be very loud throughout the night. the beds are very uncomfortable. 
Denmark,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"great host ian, very professionel , spend the time to make sure we knew the area, facilitet, what to se. very helpfull and a great place to stay :)  sincerly tina and kenneth"
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,breakfast too late 9-10am
England,Female,18-24,4,2,6,4,4,2,4,6,"staff..one member very unenthusiastic, didn't have much to say..i was only notified on the day that i would be staying in the 'extra building' that the hostel has.. which is a tatty house, really not worth the $35 i paid a night..you couldn't call it a hostel, it was a house with beds thrown in, a couple of dodgy camper beds too, bad wifi connection and a good 20 minute walk to the beach, not great when i was expecting a 5 or less, overall left me with a disappointing 2 days to end my trip."
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,4.9,4,6,6,2,6,4,6,is was old and crappy 
Australia,Male,25-30,5.7,4,6,8,4,6,6,6,"average stay for a hefty price! i guess los angeles can be quite pricey, however i still don't think this is good value for money."
Kenya,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"i took a risk to stay in venice after reading bad reviews.  but it's completely opposite,  dont believe review and relax. around the world hostels are suppose to budget with friendly atmosphere.  thanks venice beach hostel and ian. my experience, book 2 days and get free ride from airport.  its in very good location and mr. ian made my los angeles easy by providing city tips. everything is available from cable tv to bike rental.  breakfast include and free wifi. i got full day tour in luxury van"
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,10,6,2,10,8,8,"great staff :) make you very welcome....need to sort out the toilet situation and reception thing out . if they had a reception and female male toilets n showers, or at least locks , would b best hostel in venice!!! "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,"one gripe was the size of the security lockers, couldn't fit my work laptop in to lock it up. if there was a few extra large lockers available would be great!"
Brazil,Couple,25-30,3.1,2,4,4,2,4,2,4,"- address on the website doesn´t match the actual address and there isn´t any indication that it 's a hostel;  - they said it was 15min walk to the beach, when actually it´s at least 30min;  - hygiene is not good and my friend woke up scratching;  - i "
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had an awesome time here, the staff and travellers are friendly. easy to get to from airport by public bus, then it's easy to get around la with public buses/metro. beach is a short walk away. rooms, kitchen and bathrooms are clean. free breakfast is an added bonus and the hostel is close to restaurants for lunch/dinner."
Mexico,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"- first issue, the address registered in this page is not the same, i think this is a scam , i mean i all the time was thinking that we will be in the other address a few blocks from the beach.  - bad service.  - bad attitude of a few people of the front "
Germany,Couple,25-30,8.3,6,6,8,10,10,10,8,the staff at the hostel is very friendly and helpful. also the common areas are really nice. the rooms are large and leave enough space for everyone.
Australia,Couple,25-30,4.6,4,6,2,2,8,6,4,my girlfriend and i booked the double room at the venice beach hostel for one night.  immediately after booking i received an email stating that the owner had two locations one on venice beach (as advertised) and another which was pretty far from the beach and not mentioned in the ad. this was disappointing as there wasn't much nearby and was misleading.  the 'double room' didn't have a double bed but 2 folding single beds pushed together and the toilet was in the same room as the beds. 
Canada,Male,25-30,5.7,6,8,6,4,6,6,4,we rented a private room and it was a glorified walk in closet/bathroom with two cots jammed inside.  not exactly what we expected.  i would never stay here again.
Russia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel i ever stayed. friendly, clean and safe. feels like home atmosphere.  definitely will stay again."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,8,10,"the hostel doesn't have the best location, 20 min walk to beach.. but the staff is super friendly, it feels kinda like hanging out with the family in the evening. it's clean and nice."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,8,10,10,10,8,would definitely come back
Ireland,Couple,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,m ost enjoyable. excellent atmosphere.staff and guests friendly and helpful. convenient to all services.a memorable stay for all the right reason
England,Couple,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"chilled as hostel, great place for newcomers to la"
Spain,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i came from barcelona and i had an excellent time, good location, it's a kind of familiar hostel and amazing staff, always stay tuned to help you.  totally recommend."
England,Male,18-24,4.3,6,2,6,2,4,8,2,"there are just much better hostels in the area, if you dont mind people walking in on you in the shower or rampant fleas in your bed, then this is definitely the hostel for you."
Turkey,Female,18-24,6,6,6,6,6,10,4,4,"every staff such a good person but it's not everything. first of all, bedbugs ruin everything. we're staying in hostels to have fun but if you are itching everytime, sorry that is not acceptable. and they are doing nothing about it. second of all, you cannot lock the door when you're in bathroom. what is that ? the other thing is, i dont understand what kind of hostel is it because is no hostel sign aroud the building. if you dont have phone, it's imposible to find it."
Brazil,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,6,4,6,4,6,i paid for the private bedroom and findout it was only a big bathroom. no privacy to use the toilet or the bathtub (there was no shower). what a joke.
Colombia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved it! the gratest people...
NewZealand,Female,25-30,6,4,6,6,4,10,8,4,"the staff were awesome, the hostel facilities were pretty standard, the whole place could of done with a proper clean. the hostel itself is actually about a 20 minute walk from venice beach, so if you're expecting beachfront you will be a little disappointed. also they have a problem with bed bugs."
England,Male,25-30,5.7,4,4,8,6,8,8,2,"when i stayed here there were bed bugs found and instead of getting the fumigator in, the owner merely changed the sheets.......not acceptable, the guest concerned was not even reimbursed for his night. a toilet without a lock whilst not bothering me clearly affected other guests."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,6,10,8,10,chilled out! free quick wifi! bit of a walk to the beach but buses only $1. you have to walk if your taking surfboards. great place though definetly stay again!!! 
BritishIndianOceanTerritory,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"from the very moment you see the place, while being greeted by friendly staff you feel welcome and at home! the 13 person room is definitely the best choice... variety of people, yet respectful space. the mornings were inspiring. bring a friend, or go alone! safe, clean, and just perfect. "
Ireland,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,really friendly owner. met cool people here.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,brilliant ! well run ! great staff. kitchens perhaps a little small. but that would be my only gripe. 
Colombia,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,8,10,8,2,ian was an amazing host but ughhh..those bed bugs is a killer to the mood. couldn't get sleep. 
England,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,"very basic hostel in an average location. not much going on but felt homey which is what we needed at the time. nice staff, but crazy serbian guy living there when we stayed, bit rude and over powering personality also obsessed with face off. other than that, good stay."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"i have traveled all over the world and stayed in a number of hostels that were both good and bad, and i have to say that venice beach hostel is hands down my favorite one. from the moment i walked in the door the staff was warm and welcoming, and actually took the time to hang out and talk with the guests. the hostel feels more like a home for wayward travelers than just a place to crash. the atmosphere there really bred an easygoing friendly environment to talk and hang out. awesome place."
Brazil,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"worst hostel ever. there is better ones and chipper also with free shuttle bus to airport. worst experience ever. i was not expecting anything fancy, because i knew that it was a hostel, but that was too much."
France,Male,25-30,8,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,"very good team, and very good relax atmosphere.  i stayed just one night but will come back there without hesitation :)"
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"absolutely loved this place, the staff were absolutely lovely and made my stay in la awesome! "
Belgium,Male,31-40,8,6,6,8,8,10,10,8,"really nice hostel. little further from the beach but nice  and safer area. staff was friendly. i stayed on washington avenue,which is little bit away from the main building, but nice own tv room. good way to meet people. i dont understand the negative reviews, the other hostels are worse and more expensive. i can tell because i stayed there too."
Australia,Male,25-30,6.9,6,4,4,8,10,8,8,"this hostel is not in the location listed. check your email. this needs to be changed asap and is unacceptable. the staff were cool and friendly. there is no privacy in this hostel. there are no locks on the bathroom or bedroom doors. it is far away from anything, you'll need to catch a bus everywhere which was fine with me as they are pretty cheap. getting to the airport is really easy from here. i think it was 1 dollar on the bus :)"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,had incredible time here and i highly recommend it!! short on showers but that is easily over shadowed by the staff and atmosphere. you are probably travelling after all. only a 15 minute walk to venice beach and super close to buses that take you anywhere. you should totally stay here! 
England,Male,31-40,4,4,2,6,2,8,4,2,this is the worst hostel that i've ever stayed in (out of 25+) staff are ok but: the two sites are a short distance apart and the security is absolutely non-existent. anyone could walk in and out of either hostel -the second site does not have a self locking door and i walked into and around the main hostel without being challenged. as for the conditions in the main hostel: i have genuinely seen better homeless shelters: simply awful. i was actually shocked.  read other reviews before booking.
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"awesome hostel. staff for the most part were great. made some really cool friends, the vibe there is unreal. venice beach in general is just a really cool place to check out. free breakfast was just cereal "
Switzerland,Female,18-24,4,2,2,6,2,4,8,4,"all the beds had bed bugs! i didn't even had a real bed, the bed was foldable. you had to share the 2 bathrooms with girls and boys - no locks, so there was absolutely no privacy!!! no lockers in the room and no keys for the front door and dorm doors, so everyone can walk into your room.  "
Australia,Male,18-24,4,4,4,8,2,4,4,2,"bed bugs, terrible bathrooms and unfriendly staff."
Sweden,Female,18-24,8,8,6,10,6,10,10,6,"good location, only 15-20 min walk to the beach. safe area. nice atmosphere and staff!"
England,Male,18-24,3.4,2,6,2,4,4,4,2,"although advertised as venice beach hostel, it wasn't located by the beach or even in venice. (marina del ray). don't be fooled by the address on the website, or on hostel world.  upon arrival we were immediately charged an extra 10% for ""tax"" which wasn't at all suggested by the confirmation email. some staff were good and friendly; others were creepy and offensive. only 2 showers (no locks) and 2 toilets between thirty guests. the beds are also riddled with bed bugs. enjoy your stay ;)"
Egypt,Male,18-24,3.1,2,8,4,2,2,2,2,"the place is not clean at all, and there are bedbugs. and there is a person he's really annoying and strange. so shortly, the place is not nice at all and avoid it. they also got some fake photos on hostel world. and the hostel is far away from the beach. "
Australia,Couple,25-30,6.3,4,8,6,8,10,4,4,although we enjoyed our time in vencie beach the hostel was a fair walk from the beach we also found the (shared) bathroom floor had blood all over it when we arrived and also that we were booked at another site/ location that we were not made aware of until arrival and where we had to drag our bags over gravel to the other site ( just not ideal after getting off a 15 hr flight) kinda wish they would have just given the address of the other place for the bus to drop our bags there
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,8,8,10,10,8,it was my first time at a hostel and i really enjoyed it. met some awesome people who i hanged with most of my stay
Canada,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,i thought that this was a great hostel in terms of value for my money and close proximities to lax airport and the beach in san monica. i would recommend others to stay there if you like to stay close to a beach and shopping.
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,cool friendly people and hostel staff
Ireland,Male,18-24,4.3,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,"property is not in the location listed on hostel world, instead you receive an email after booking saying ""hey we've temporarily relocated, here's our new address."" not acceptable. no locks on the rooms or in general, anyone could walk into the ""hostel"" and into the rooms if they pleased. 2 showers between how ever many beds also not acceptable. guy who runs it very nice and helpful but whole set up just feels deceitful. "
Brazil,Male,41+,5.1,2,6,6,4,8,8,2,"i did my reservation for 7 days, paid for reservation and received document stating that the remainder would pay on the date of entry, for total consideration less the value for booking. to my surprise, the day of entry was charged at 100%. even presenting the document, i received a bizarre explanation of fees i had to pay 2 x the amount of the booking and not got receipt.even for the long period of seven days, was not granted discount provided on the site.  there was no airport shuttle."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,"not to bad. it's about a mile walk to the pier and beach or a bus is right there. a super market is close too. the bed was kinda like something from 50 years back but i got over it. i never woke up for it but i'd assume the breakfast was good. because it was free. free food= good food. the staff was fine i guess. i pretty much just stayed on venice beach the whole time. price was a little high. that was the only thing i though ""meeh"" on. otherwise it's not bad. "
France,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,very kind staff !! the place was big and the internet worked well which is not the case in all the hostels... i am overally happy with my stay there !
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,2.9,2,4,2,2,6,2,2,"very disappointed, we had booked two nights but left after one. the hostel was about 2 miles from the beach which is not what we expected. our room was in a separate   building to the actual hostel, about a 10 min walk. the room was next to a busy road which made sleeping near impossible.  beds were uncomfortable and very basic. of the two members of staff the lady was pleasant and helpful, the only positive. overall we were not happy and surprised with an overall rating of c 70% on your site,"
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,"too noisy in the night, i woke up 2 times during 2 nights because of the loud noise"
Australia,Male,18-24,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,good social setting good staff
Germany,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"really nice atmosphere, as its a house made to a hostel. the bathrooms, where everybody can be in the room while you are on toilet or in the shower is a bit strange but really funny!  very nice staff. very close to venice beach (15 mins walk).  great location to hang around and meet people!"
Canada,Female,18-24,2.3,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,"it was a 30 minutes walk from venice beach, they had bed bugs, and when i told them they only put me in another bed and the same night there was somebody else in that bed!! michael and inga were nice, but the place is not well managed, worst hostel i have stayed in so far for sure!! the beds are really uncomfortable too!!   bed bugs is a serious matter, when you find one you have to exterminate the whole place, no matter the cost, don't go there they need to exterminate the place! and they won't"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,8,6,"all in all, the hostel was nice. information, however, is not very good. there are two locations, hostelworld.com has the wrong adress, check-in is in another place. the second place, where i slept, is like a real house with big bathroom, kitchen and living room (+ tv). but for breakfast you have to walk down to the other house. you can walk to the beach in 20min. tax is not included in the prices! for the prices i ended up paying i expected a little more comfort. the bed was really unstable."
Poland,Female,31-40,7.4,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,"everything's fine except one thing - changing of the rules. when i arrived i was informed that the day of departure if i leave my luggage after 2pm i would pay extra 5$ (quite surprising, but ok). the next day in the morning, the day of my departure, i was informed by another person from the staff that i would pay extra 10$. the situation was really unpleasant. finally i paid 5$ (and i wouldn't have paid more because i hate if someone plays like that). this situation left a bad impression."
SouthAfrica,Female,31-40,4.9,4,2,6,4,6,6,6,"i had paid $4.33  on the internet, the site said the difference i was going to pay at the hostel was $23.67 misleading)the owner made me pay at $28 saying the rate didnt include tax, i felt cheated, i slept on a torn duvet and not clean, bed.was squeaky.all night worse with the person on top, the owner pretends  to be nice but i didn't think so, he is all.about money and from a business point of view, he is going to lose. customers,improvement can be.done if constructive criticism is"
Germany,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,6,10,10,8,"very friendly salutation with a quick and informative overview for everything in and arround the hostel. the privat room was big, but you had to pass the dorm to get in! inventary was rustic but nice. toast and cornflakes as breakfast (expected more!) and a vendor for beer and softies :) good food arround.just 20min. walk to venice beach - bus also availible. good connection to the airport 30min. with big blue bus by 1$. finally i was very happy to have a nice place for my stopover. thanks a lot"
Denmark,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,8,10,6,inga is the best :d had a great stay. friendly and helpfull staff. good location in la. venice beach is great!
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,10,8,it takes 30 min to the beach by foot. in return it is a calm and safe surrounding. the stop of the blue line bus from and to the airport is 2 min away by foot. the atmosphere in the hostel is very pleasant.
England,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,"loved this place (despite hating la in general) the staff were really cool people and encouraged social through chat and not loud music and free beer.  my only issue was the television, but i ignored it so that was fine. it's close to places to buy supplies and about a 20 min walk to the beach."
Brazil,Female,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,6,10,8,4,it was just fine... nothing else. the bed and the mattress was very old and uncomfortable.
Canada,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,10,8,6,8,6,6,the main property on yale seemed nice but since we had booked a private room we were further down the street. when we arrived they had just installed a carpet and the whole room was in disarray. the staff did her best to get things ready as quickly as possible. she was really nice but overly apologetic about hosteling in general. we've stayed in a lot of hostels so it seemed unnecessary that she was trying to soothe us as if we didn't get the concept and were secretly appalled. good location.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,4.9,4,4,6,4,8,4,4,an older home converted into a hostel. good location for buses but a 20minute walk to venice beach. beds need to be repaired (i was on the top bunk which was wobbly and very creaky). linen was old/not very clean looking. rooms and bathrooms couldn't be locked (which is only ok if there are bathrooms designated female or male) so no privacy whatsoever having a shower/getting changed. staff members were friendly + helpful.
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,6,10,6,6,the location was a bit far from the beach.  the hostel was nearly impossible to find because hostelworld had given me a wrong address and i was never emailed the correct address.  the staff was great and friendly.  it was a plus that there was a shuttle from the airport.
Finland,Couple,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,"staff was great! we stayed four nights, only problem that happened was in the middle of night, when (there were no staff) smoke detector started to beep in the ceiling and we couldn't turn that off..  the neighborhood was peaceful and hostel was 20 min walk from the ocean.."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"the staff was excellent, i only stayed one night and had to wake up before dawn the next day, so they put me in a room with less people so i wouldn't wake everyone up, and so i could get to bed earlier, very accommodating. wish i could have stayed longer the hostel seemed pretty cool with decent facilities, nice kitchen, ect."
Japan,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i love this staff!!!!! they're friendly and kind;)  it's a little bit far from dm, but no problem! you can take a bus near the hostel. also, you can walk from the hostel to venice beach and santa monica! they were awesome;0 i wish i could stay more..... thank you so much!! enjoy, la!!!!!!"
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,6,8,10,10,10,8,"the beds need a bit of oil, i didn't mind that they dipped low but the creaking drove me insane :) other than that had such a lovely experience."
Egypt,Male,25-30,5.4,4,8,8,2,10,4,2,"the staff is really nice and helpful. however the place is so cold due to bad insulation and it's not clean especially the bedrooms, they smell really bad i could not sleep in my bed cuz of the very low hygienic level of the beddings."
Germany,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,most of the rooms are very cold during the winter session. walking distance to venice beach about 30 minutes.
Germany,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,6,6,8,8,8,it was realy cold in the hostel in the winter
Germany,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,6,4,6,4,4,i had bedbugs!!!
Finland,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"hostel staff members were very helpful and friendly, and willing to share information about los angeles and venice/santa monica environment. i will give average for facilities since private room did not have showers. hostel building was very comfortable and on a positive note i want to emphasise that there is free parking on the street where the hostel is located."
Germany,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,we had a good time in venice beach. marco was very funny. i recommend it!
Germany,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,"don't book here, you will pay double!!! the hostel gets nothing from the money you paid in advances. and ist more expensive... they also have weird guests including us"
England,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"lovely staff, felt homely too, a pleasant stay!"
Canada,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"the free airport pick up was a big bonus, and i was able to have good, much needed sleeps in the bedrooms - a big relief after too much time spent in noisy party hostels. the tips about the area provided on check in were also helpful."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was amazing!!!! the staff were amazing, the beer vending machine was unreal and we had the time of our lives!!!!"
Turkey,Male,25-30,4.6,4,6,4,4,4,6,4,"stayed there 7 nights. stuff was nice (actually changed for 3 times in a week!) but the owner was a bit over excited about the way we were partying, he was always complaining about his neighbors will be mad about him coz of us! they even didnt  let us to use the bbq in the backyard. 20mins walk to the beach!"
Austria,Male,18-24,6.9,6,8,6,8,8,8,4,"good hostel, can work on a few things but overall happy with my stay."
England,Male,25-30,4.3,6,4,2,4,6,4,4,"this hostel was sold on the internet as the venice beach hostel on venice beach. the pictures on the internet were pictures overlooking the beach suggesting that the hostel was located on the beach. in fact the hostel is a twenty five minute walk from the beach! the hostel is dated and the beds are very uncomfortable, i could feel the springs from the mattress in my back. the staff were friendly but the hostel appeared to be run in a very disorganized. i would have preferred to stay elsewhere!"
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"very nice place, you really think beeing in a hostel at 70s!"
Denmark,MixedGroup,25-30,4.9,6,8,6,4,4,4,2,the hostel really has potential but there is just no good vibe. people here were not really up for anything and then it really ends up being just a lot of beds crammed into some space.
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,the hostel had fantastic character and a great atmosphere for young people and travellers.  the staff were all really helpful and friendly and made you feel safe in the area.  great value for money. always clean. lots of quirky character and decoration. location about a 20 minute walk to beach but it is located close to shops and food places. typical shared hostel rooms and front door is usually open without security we chose a private locking room for this reason but  wasn't really necessary.
Poland,MixedGroup,18-24,4.6,4,2,6,6,4,6,4,"we were disappointed with the hostel. having read the comments here, we knew it wasn't going to be perfect. however, it was far worse than expected. there is no security at all, the door to the hostel is always wide open. we paid for an 8-bed dorm, but got put in a 13-bed one!!! there was absolutely no space to walk in the room because the beds occupied it all. the facilities are all very old and not too clean. the owner of the hostel is greedy and rather irritating."
NewZealand,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,8,8,6,8,6,"the hostel was a good place to stay, good location in relation to the beach and airport.  the hostel could be better if there was a little bit more information about things to do in la, maps, brochures, etc."
Germany,Female,18-24,3.4,2,2,6,2,6,4,2,"no security at all, only two ( dirty ) showers for everyone, the ""beach""hostel is 20 min away from the beach, you pay too much for what you get."
Australia,Female,31-40,8,8,6,8,8,10,10,6,"i have to say that i loved this place! it was not spotless but one of the friendliest, most relaxed hostel i have ever stayed at. ian who runs the place is so helpful and social that it makes the whole place fun and it felt like home. security is there if you need it(lockers available) but it was such an open friendly place that i did not use one in the end. the whole place to me felt like a big old share house. awesome."
Netherlands,Female,31-40,5.4,2,8,8,4,6,6,4,it's to expensive for what you get. to many beds in the rooms and bathrooms you can't close. i don't want people to walk into the bathroom when i shower .
Germany,Male,18-24,4.9,2,6,6,2,6,4,8,the mattresses were definitely the oldest i have slept on in my hole 3 month trip. they were very uncomfortable and i also used my sleeping bag because i did not want to use the provided blankets and i´m definitely not so picky if it comes to things like this...  besides a little trouble with the owner i had a very nice stay and met a lot of nice guys. the chill out area is nice but make sure to bring a laptop or so since the provided computers to use the internet are very expensive!
England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,6,8,6,10,6,8,a very friendly relaxed hostel. welcoming staff and within walking distance to venice beach.
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,8,8,10,8,10,this hostel was great nice little hostel with a beachy house kinda thing!!easy walk to the beach!the staff were so friendly and always there to help and give good advice!clean all the time mabe one more bath room would have been better!!nice cool rooms close by shops!
Australia,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"very cool hostel, in a great and safe location near bars and a beach! i was impressed that tour information was made available to me when i arrived. only improvements would be a fan in the rooms as i found it very humid in the rooms as i was travelling in the summer"
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.9,6,8,10,8,10,10,10,friendly and welcoming staff. very cosy and comfortable. brilliant location 10 minutes walk from the beach. will definately stay here again if i'm in the area.
Switzerland,Male,25-30,8,8,6,8,8,10,10,6,this is more like a huge family house. but the spirit is awesome! :) the ppl are great. you can easily make tons of frineds in no time and have interesting discussion! :) i really loved that place. but it's totally not the classic backpacker. so if you want your sardin bunk bed and standart hostel - this is not it!  this one is really special !! great spirit and pretty close to venice.  make sure to check out the channels in venice as well (not only the beach) i find the channels much much nicer
Australia,Female,31-40,4.9,4,4,6,2,8,8,2,filthy rooms. sheets / blankets never changed. dust mites / fleas / bed bugs in the carpets - got eaten alive . showers have no privacy at all. it's a half hour walk to the beach. a big plus - close to lax.
Poland,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"hostel in nice location, although it takes about 20 minutes walking to get to venice beach. rather not a party hostel, good for people wanting to chill. hostel is in a normal house converted into a hostel. nice and helpful staff."
USA,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the owner of the hostel was extremely unprofessional, he didn't even know how to use the credit card machine. the rooms were extremely unclean, they didn't even provide proper bedding. the house was continuously left unlocked, no keys or codes were given. i am an avid traveler and this by far is the worst hostel i have stayed in."
Sweden,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awsome crew!
Australia,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,4,8,8,8,8,8,"booked an 8-9 bed dorm, however on arrival we were reshuffled to the annex location of the hostel about 5 blocks down the road closer to the beach. was only a 5 bed dorm, so we will call it a win. downside was breakfast was at the primary hostel, which we needed to drive to. carparks available on street was good. good vibe. cheap vending machine onsite with beverages. one thing to note, this place is hard to find as it looks just like a residential house in nice surburban street. stay again."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i have ever stayed at!
Canada,Female,18-24,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,#NAME?
Germany,Male,18-24,6.6,8,4,8,4,10,8,4,"super friendly and helpful staff, they know the area and are happy to give you some advice if you ask! the other guests were really nice too. however, the security was not very good, no locks on room doors, no lockers and a front door open to anyone. also, one bathroom for three dorms is not sufficient. t  for the price its a good hostelhe rooms were not very clean, but i've seen worse"
England,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"spot on, no qualms at all. good, friendly place near enough to the beach."
India,Female,31-40,3.7,2,2,8,2,4,6,2,"ian, just wanted to let u know michael was rude as hell day i returned to fetch somethin i had forgotten in room (after i moved out) n he should learn how to talk to guests 'decently' if not nicely. joe was great n so is aisha. do provide soap n try make the toilet/shower area bit more cleaner..fix d downstairs shower door etc. all d best."
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,10,10,8,6,beer for one buck :)
Australia,Female,31-40,4.9,4,4,6,4,6,4,6,when i booked it i thought it was where i stayed a few years ago. both hostels have the same name. i was not very happy to stay. at least it was only one night.
Cambodia,Female,25-30,6.9,8,8,4,4,10,8,6,"venice marina hostel was a nice stay for the pay. it was a bit confusing to arrive at the hostel and find hat we were in a neighborhood in marina del rey rather than venice beach and a block from the water as the name and address stated "" venice beach hostel"". apparently there are two different locations and this one is on yale avenue! it was a 20-30 minute walk to venice beach although it's not too. the transit system is very good in the area to get down to abbot kinney, the airport, venice or santa monica  and it's only 1$ each time you ride. we booked for 3 nights and stayed 3 nights. an airport pick-up was provided by ian who was very accommodating and kind. we rented the private room which was a great amount of space for two people- we had our own jacuzzi tub, two sinks at the vanity and cable! i get a bit squeamish with smells  and cleanliness so be aware in the communal bathroom area as there is some mold and the pool table room smells slightly of urine- it is an older home that could be maintained a bit better. i would recommend this hostel as it was a nice stay for the cost- it wasn't loud, everyone is nice and there is a vending machine with $1 beers and free breakfast!"
Australia,Male,18-24,4.6,4,6,4,8,2,2,6,my mates wallet was stollen. nothing exciting happened there. the hostel isn't actually in venice beach it was the next suburb and was easily a 25 minute walk to the beach. overall pretty average place for the price they charge
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place. very laidback.
Netherlands,Male,31-40,6.3,6,6,6,4,6,10,6,weird configuration of bathrooms. the toilets should be made seperately or at least be more private. showers didn't have hangers to put your clothes or stuff on. the shower in the 2nd floor didn't allow to take your clothes off easily without getting wet. some matrassen didn't have cover sheets. blankets might have been clean but they looked liked they were from my grandma. weird pass-though door to private room in bedroom on second floor.
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"i very good hostel......it doesn't look like a hostel, looks like your home. people are nice and they have 1 dollar beer.........nice place stay........close to venice beach. you will not regret being there."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"awesome hostel, super nice and helpful staff, good atmosphere...."
Australia,Male,18-24,6,4,6,8,2,10,6,6,the beds very uncomfortable and the linen was ragged and not very nice. the mattress springs could be felt through the mattress
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,8,4,8,8,10,10,6,"this place is great if you're looking for a fun, easygoing place where you can hang out and meet cool people from all over the world.  it's more as if it's someone house - very chill.  ian, the guy who works there, was really friendly and helpful.  about a 20 minute walk to the beach.  plus it's right next to an in n out burger!  super rad place, didn't want to leave. not the most private or secure, but had a funky, cool, energetic vibe that i loved."
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brilliant place to stay, staff were very helpful and extremely friendly i felt right at home straight away. we stayed in the two bed private dorm and the room was better than any hostel room i'd stayed in before!  highly recomend."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,4,8,6,2,6,6,6,"wasn't a big fan of this place and quite disappointed the reviews sounded good, it's run by all men and this gives it a slovenly old feeling to be honest. breakfast is pretty good but apart from that, the place is falling apart. holes in the floor, a shower door that fell on top of a girl getting into the shower, graffiti all over the toilet doors and not even a sign out the front to easily find it. clean enough bed clothes though."
Norway,Female,18-24,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"when we arrived to this hostel there was no sign to whether it was a real hostel or not, there was no one working there and it looked really bad. we called the hostel and the man working there was out for coffee, when he came back to the hostel he was so rude and said ""well its okay to leave the place unattended and i needed a coffee"" we were hessitent to stay there and the man snapped at ous and told us i dont care if u live here but im charging you anyway and just walked in to the hostel."
HongKong,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,6,6,10,8,6,"there is 2 verice beach hostels in that area, which is very confusing."
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the owner is the coolest most helpful guy we met on our travels and if you are looking for a classic venice beach experience this place cannot be missed. great place, great people, perfect hostel."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,laid back hostel. quite a distance from the actual beach though
Australia,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"very welcoming and helpful, brought a feeling of ease and relaxation. lots of fellow aussies there when i was there. thanks"
Canada,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,great place for the cost... very relaxed and informal environment.  friendly and fun!!
USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,get hostel! loved the people and staff here... did have to stay down the street in a different hostel that was owned by the same owner but it was definitely not as nice but still a great stay and still allowed at the main hostel as much as we wanted. i will be here again
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,4,6,6,8,8,8,the venice beach is like one big share house. the staff are helpful with directions and things to do around the area. i was not concern about the security but be aware that there are no locks on the doors so use your common sense with any valuables. hollywood is a bus trip away.
Netherlands,Male,18-24,6.6,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,"great hostel! breakfast was okay, location is pretty good and the staff is very nice and helpfull! it doesn't feel like a regular hostel, but more like a normal house with living room etc."
Scotland,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"felt very welcome.  great staff, great banter, good times!"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"well located for my course,they even picked me up at the airport,staff very helpful and friendly"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"joe scott was a wonderful host and ian was an excellent manager. i enjoyed meeting frank, kevin, and the other guests from france, the netherlands, and finland during my short stay."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.7,6,2,6,6,8,6,6,this hostel is more like a large shared house than a hostel really - if you like a little privacy you may not like this. when we arrived we asked if it was okay for us to share a double bed and assured that the hostel was safe and secure. when we woke up in the morning there were two guys asleep in the front room and the front door was unlocked! the staff were friendly and refunded us some money after they over-charged us. overall: a little unorganised.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,"a really friendly place in a sometimes unfriendly city. in a good neighbourhood and 15 minutes walk to venice beach. the owner and staff are really friendly and you will always find one of them hanging around to talk about getting places and any other advice. the hostel is exceptionally clean, a real rarity. the only issue i had was the privacy is somewhat limited - the bathrooms do not lock so you only have the toilet cubicle and the shower door to separate you from other people in the bathroom"
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,nice hostel with the flair of a family's house. i stayed here for two weeks and had a great time!
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,"this hostel looks like a big house. it has a good kitchen and a good common room. there are only 2 bathrooms. the rooms are filled with beds, think we had 12 in ours in a room that is not that big. it was about an half hour walk to venice beach which was a bit of a hike."
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,10,6,10,8,10,8,6,"extremely friendly staff, excellent location. good value for the money."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6,8,2,8,4,6,6,8,"none of the doors have locks and the front door to the house is always open.  there are only 2 bathrooms in the entire house which had at least 10 people at all times while we were there.  overall ok stay, was extremely uncomfortable when one of the staff asked a guest if she was a ""bad girl"" and to come find him if she was.  ian the owner was extremely nice and hospitable."
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,8,4,6,6,6,6,8,"good experience on my part, but i did overhear an older male worker making inappropriate comments to one of the female guests in the room next to me"
China,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,10,6,"near the venice beach,but the privacy room is a little too old"
Vietnam,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,the staff is one of the friendliest staff i've encountered.  this hostel has a unique setting of being in an actual house-turned-hostel.  the facilities were clean and kept up very well.  i would recommend this hostel to anyone and will hopefully have a chance to visit it again in the future.
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"venice beach hostel, has all the basic necessities, it's got a good location and great staff.  best of all, you can relax and feel at home there."
Indonesia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.9,8,6,6,6,8,8,6,"overall was good. but if you are going to travel mainly to downtown, this location is a little bit too far to downtown, but very close to the beach. this hostel is pretty much cheap and what you pay what you get. i'm quite satisfied."
Australia,Couple,18-24,3.4,2,4,4,2,2,4,6,"we had a terrible experience with this hostel.   the address is wrong. it is not in venice beach but the suburb next door, meaning no taxi driver, gps or street directory could not find the hostel.  tax was not included in the price so we ended up paying an extra $10 on arrival.  we were also treated extremely rudely and intimidated by a staff member when we asked for our money back because we were put in a 14 bed dorm instead of the 8 bed dorm we booked. he also refused to give us the manager's #."
Germany,Male,18-24,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"old hostel, horrible bathrooms, worst beds, not going back..."
Australia,Male,41+,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,10,8,stayed here a few times nice spot friendly staff  will stay here every time im in la.
Austria,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,10,8,8,10,we had a really good time! great hostel! 30 min to venice beach.
Wales,Couple,18-24,8.3,10,6,8,10,8,8,8,"this is a great hostel located a 20 min walk from venice boulevard. the hostel was great, free breakfast, $1 beers, free internet, free detergent for a washer and dryer that costs only $2.50 and actually cleans your clothes! we paid the little extra to stay in the only private double twin but it was sooo worth it! the dorm rooms looked quite crowded but but we were in a similar sized room for 2 with a bath, 2 sinks, a tv and a toilet! bit cold in the night tho only downside."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,8,10,"good hostel, staff  friendly and helpful. good location, close to the airport, bus straight there in 20 min, walking distance to venice beach, bars, shopping etc. i stayed here once then came back a second time. you can easily get a bus to santa monica, hollywood etc. good value for money and better than staying in hollywood. it's like a big house,great if you want to chill but can drink as well if you want. deff recommend it, also has good parking if you have a car."
Germany,Couple,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,"nice place to be, especially the two bedroom with own toilet and bath. 20 minutes to walk to venice beach!"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,6,6,10,8,6,"the free airport pickup (with minimum 2 nights stay) was very nice and i really liked that the staff was so friendly and helpful.  the dorms were okay, too.  maybe some people would have a problem with the bathroom because you cannot lock the shower and the shower is in one (big!) room with the toilet (which you can lock!), but there is at least a curtain and actually nobody comes in when you're having a shower.  all in all a very nice place with a lot of nice people and located in a good area."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,4,6,10,10,10,6,amazing vibe at this place and the staff are the best. was mislead in terms of how close the place is to venice beach but the price and character of the place easily made up for that.
England,Male,31-40,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"after intending to stay only 3 days, i stayed 15 nights! one of the best hostels i've stayed at in 13 years: a great area, better than touristic santa monica, with everything close-by; staff are awesome, so friendly, down-to-earth, helpful, just real chill people; clean, facilitated kitchen (cleaned each day); homely, unlike standard soulless/expensive hostels, thus it doesn't need huge signs outside - a house number &amp; street name is all you need if you're smart :p thanks for a great 2 weeks! :)"
Denmark,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,thers is so cold and they dó not put warm ón
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,8,4,8,6,10,8,6,"i was anxious after reading reviews online, but decided i should try anyway.  it was awesome.    the other people in the house were great.  a fifteen minute walk to the beach.    the closest comparison would be to staying at a party house, without the party."
Italy,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,"a big old house with a great salon and a big kitchen. very easy-going staff, if you need help, hey will help you!  it is a bit humid and some heating more can be necessary in winter, but apart from that, the hostel is cool.  of course it is a hostel, we are not talking of average hotel services!    anyway a cheap, sufficiently clean and relaxed place to stay in l.a.    thank you vbh!    mattia"
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a great experience here. the staff are lovely, and the people here are great. i met such interesting and fun people here, and you really feel at home. i will 100% stay here again."
England,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,6,8,10,8,8,"nice hostel, great helpful staff. good value for money. quite a long walk from the main part of venice beach though."
Italy,Couple,25-30,2.9,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,"we are a young couple, and we have booked a private room with a ""private barthroom"": the beds were awful, our room and the common kitchen  were dirty, and the worst thing was that the so called ""private barthroom"" was simply a wc and a bath tub in the bedroom, it was not another room, so there were not separating walls between the bedroom and the ""bathroom""!!"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was great, i met a lot of good people. i will definitely stay there again the next time i return to venice beach."
India,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,6,8,10,10,10,"although i stayed only for a night, i really liked my stay. the staff was very helpful and courteous. i'll certainly stay at venice beach hostel when i come back to venice."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,10,8,"i enjoyed to stay at your hostel, as it had a cozy and nice atmosphere.   moreover, i liked to have the breakfast included and i loved the christmas dinner.  thanks a lot for all your help!"
France,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,10,6,"very peaceful and family sized venice's hostel  located around 15 minutes walk from the beach.  great free wifi access everywhere in the house.  that really looks like a usual home instead of a true hostel.  max around 25/30 beds i believe.  near los angeles lax main airport and marina del rey.  no curfew and kitchen very available because of so few people.  managers are here just to keep an eye and hardly ever bother you.  cheap price, good value, one of my best experience so far.  i do will come back."
Sweden,Male,41+,5,0,4,8,0,4,4,6,"weird place! no one said hardly anything and the staff did not accept the hostelworld price until a few hours later. there was not a sign for the hostel so i was confused at first. no lockers and no keys, not even for the front door. i would not stay here again. i recommend surf city hostel instead!"
England,Male,31-40,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"this hostel isn't your average check in, use the facilities and check out  affair. it's more like a house share with rooms, lounge, kitchen etc and everyone getting into the spirit of the occasion. i stayed longer than planned because i simply had no desire to leave! ian the owner is a really decent bloke as are all the staff.  i was here during thanksgiving what a meal they laid on! if you're looking for good value hostel in a great location with a fantastic atmosphere then you've found it."
Sweden,Male,18-24,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"this is the friendliest hostel i have ever stayed at. i felt very welcome when i walked in the front door the first night because of the incredibly helpful staff, the staff is always there to help out with any problems you might have.   you make a lot of friends because of this friendly atmosphere and i have been to a lot of activities with my new friends.  the location is also really good, just a 15-20 minute walk to the lovely venice beach!     i highly recommend the venice beach hostel!"
France,Female,25-30,6.3,0,2,6,0,8,6,8,"it looks more like a grandma house than a hostel. no security: no locker, nobody checking after midnight.   we cant even lock the bathroom for the shower which only has a curtain!   i wouldnt recommend that place although it was alright"
Germany,Couple,25-30,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,6,8,"we really enjoyed the stay here. the double room is quite huge and has its own bathroom with a big bathtube. venice beach is a 20 minutes walk but buses are driving there as well. to get from or to lax, one can take the big blue bus 3 for only 1 dollar!!"
England,Male,18-24,5.7,0,4,4,0,6,4,8,need to get rid of the tv! turns everyone into zombies
Scotland,Female,18-24,3,0,4,4,0,2,4,2,"the worst hostel i have ever been in. room was disgusting - bugs, stained carpet, stained toilet. staff made me really uncomfortable with their comments and they gave us totally inaccurate information about travel times. also they said the beach was 15 mins walk away. it is more than double that."
Luxembourg,Male,18-24,8.3,0,10,8,0,10,8,6,"great staff, great hostel, nothing more to say"
England,Female,18-24,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,"great place to be. lovely people. these laundry and bikes for rent, breakfast and tv.just fun to be at. i would definitely come here again!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,8,"i loved my stay at this hostel, it had character and a good vibe. the staff were very pleasant and helpful, the only downfall was that there was only one hot shower  and a cold shower down stairs for the entire hostel, i also had a problem with the bed bugs, apart from that i had a wonderful time in la and would return again."
England,Male,18-24,6.7,0,2,6,0,10,8,6,"unique place, they picked us up from the airport for free, check internet, $1 beers free breakfast, friendly staff so all in all a nice place to stay as long as you get the private room. the dorms looked overcrowed and uncomfortable."
Finland,Female,18-24,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,"the hostel was hard to find in the dark, no signs or anything but the staff was kind to guide us."
Spain,Female,31-40,6.7,0,4,6,0,8,8,8,"when i arrived to the hostel, it was not clear that was a hostel since there is no sign at all. you do not get any receipt after paying, and in my case i was charged more than expected, since i had deposited something through the web but i was charged the whole amount. i did not complain at that point since i honestly did not remember what i had pending to pay, but i expected the hostel to have the accounts clear. besides that feeling of not being in a regular and legal hostel, the rest was fine"
England,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great hostel, highly recommended, great location and great price"
Belgium,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"typical guesthouse ! i just love it. if one day i'm back in l.a, definitely i'll try to stay there once again. nice staff, clean house, close to the beach (10 min walk), good atmosphere."
England,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"had a great stay at the hostel, friendly staff, helpful to sort out any queries you may have, community atmosphere, just like a big house really, nice to have the big kitchen and lounge area :) would recommend a stay here, small walk to the beach which is fantastic :)"
France,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the hostel was awesome! i stayed just for 2 days but i had a really good time. the hostel team is really nice and helpful. i definitely recommend you this hostel. you will not be disappointed.    ludovic
England,Female,25-30,4.3,0,6,6,0,2,4,2,"we were taken to a separate part of the hostel because the main part was fully booked apparently but this not very convenient as there were no facilities in this part such as breakfast so we had to walk all the way back to the main part each morning in order to get some breakfast which wasn't what we had planned for.  the room we were staying in was nice but there was no lock on the door which i didn't like.  also the main guy was extremely rude!!! arrogant, condescending and very unhelpful."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,0,6,8,0,10,8,6,"i liked the hostel a lot because of the great feeling you have being there. i stayed there by myself and the warm, almost family-like atmosphere made it easy to find people to hang out with. also the cleaning service was outstanding as they cleaned every day. what i didn't like was the untended condition of the hostel itself. it had so much potential and there were only small things like the shower-curtain (which really needs to be changed) to make the place a lot nicer. the staff was helpful."
SouthAfrica,Male,25-30,8,0,6,8,0,10,8,6,i would reccomend this hostel to anyone. it has a lot of character and an awesome vibe. the staff were really helpful and went the extra mile to suggest things to do in la. the hostel is also close to venice beach.
England,Male,18-24,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,"great hostel, loads of fun and good layout. ian and mike are great. only downside was there were only 2 bathrooms for the whole of the hostle but this didn't really affect my overall enjoyment of the place."
France,MixedGroup,25-30,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,"do not go there - awfull - far from the centre, foam matresses are on the floor, sheets didn't seem clean and just no atmosphere - weird."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,4,0,2,4,0,6,2,4,"stay away!!!! this should not be called the venice beach hostel, it is located at least 30 minutes walk from the beach near an intersection which is popular with the local bums. also if you are looking to have some fun whilst in venice don't stay here, we had some drinks one night and ended up getting kicked out the next day! the breakfast is a joke and there are no locks on any of the doors or even the main door to the hostel! no activities or available staff to help out with anything."
England,Female,31-40,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,6,"a lovely welcoming hostel. felt more like at home stay than being in a hostel. a great place for meeting people &amp; having fun. ian (the owner) &amp; mick (i think) couldn't do more for you. free breakfast, tea &amp; coffee. i had booked into a 6 bed but ended up in a huge 13 bed dorm for the first night... they soon corrected that though. just one downside.. ian, invest in some new bedsheets. they may be clean but they look sooo old :-(  other than that a great stay &amp; i would recommend. lockers downstairs"
Wales,Male,18-24,8,0,6,8,0,10,8,8,really good hostel for the price! close to the beach and the owner is really helpful with how to get around and so on.
Australia,Couple,25-30,7,0,6,8,0,8,6,6,"convenient location for public transport, eating out and grocery shopping. had the private twin room - one suggestion is to put a shower head over the bathtub in this room, so guests wouldn't have to use the shared bathroom. one thing i didn't like about the shared bathroom was having carpet on the floor instead of tiles - felt a bit gross walking on carpet with wet feet. also, there were no rails or racks to hang towels and clothes while in the shower. put some rails up pronto!"
Canada,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"i though my experience at the hostel was quite fun and interesting considering that most of the time the hostel doors aren't locked and ppl seem to love and respect one another, so i'm giving it a good reference."
Australia,Male,25-30,4.7,0,4,2,0,8,4,6,we were recommended the 'venice beach hostel'... we quickly realized we had booked the wrong one.
Brazil,Male,31-40,4.3,0,6,4,0,4,4,4,"i have been in many hostel, but unfortunately this one it was the first everybory can smoke inside it..."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.3,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"great place to stay near venice beach, only a 20min walk to the beach and close to a supermarket and bottle store. really relaxed atmosphere and the staff are really great and friendly and know lots about the area so they can always point you in the right direction."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,2,"it was rude that i got taken to another place down the road because they were full because i ended up staying in a room that was unlike the one i had booked. it was also quite dirty and not very nice, as well as being smaller and not having many people as did the main part of the hostel. it also didn't have any internet which i was meant to have as it was part of the reason why i had booked that hostel. the staff were also a bit weird and not very professional. one of the worst hostels so far."
France,Female,18-24,3.3,0,2,4,0,2,2,2,don' t go !!!
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i loved this place and we had a very nice stay during the days in los angeles!! i recommend it without a doubt and i could come back here.
England,Male,25-30,9,0,10,8,0,10,8,10,"the staff here were so amazing, the friendliest we have met in 5 months of travel and the most helpful! happy to answer any of your questions. facilities were also great, rooms nice, cheap laundry service and good breakfast. about a 20 min walk from venice beach itself but close to lots of good resturants and services."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,always given a warm welcome whenever i return. very cozy setting. love the wood beam ceilings upstairs.
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.3,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,"great homely feel, mike and ian super helpful guys.. will definately be back!"
England,Couple,25-30,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,like a home from home. saw my first english football games in 6 months! cheers mike and ian for a hassle free enjoyable stay.
England,Female,18-24,6,0,4,6,0,8,6,6,"the hostel is an old house; it is quirky and has character. however, in our eyes the hostel needed a lot of work to get it up to scratch. we stayed in the private room with ensuite: there is no contained bathroom, the toilet is in the corner of the room and there is a bath in the middle of the room. camp-beds and bed linen is very old. not our cup of tea! kitchen is fine. 25 minute walk to venice beach.   iain the owner is very helpful and knowledgeable and the airport pick up is excellent."
Austria,Male,18-24,7.3,0,4,6,0,8,10,8,too cold inside... :( best time to stay in this hostel would be in summer.
Belgium,Male,18-24,9.3,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,"enjoyed staying in this amazing tirol style ""hostel"" filled with a lot of character! viewed many hostels around and would definitely recommend this one to all travelers. it's a spacious and cosy house, with a very good kitchen area and living space. the dorms are clean and there's enough room to stash your stuff. the over friendly staff can answer all your questions about the area and more. close to the beach, safe area and oh yeah the vending machine + free breakfast = amazing :) enjoy ur stay"
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,the hostel is a very nice house and in a good location!! it's closed to santa monica and to the beach!!  the staff is very friendly and helpful!!
France,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,"i really like this place  it's a big old house : the owner is a ""tall guy"" from uk very friendly  he knows very well what's happened around l.a.  the other one who work there is also cool : more chill .    there are no locks : it's a free house   don't worries : it's a safe place because all the time someone is looking at.    the kitchen is great : you have all to make a good recipe  it's like home    free breakfast : that's very important to begin a new day    very chill &amp; cheap hostel    nico from toulous"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,place was great. people were so nice and was relaxing in a great location. loved the $1 beer vending machine. shower was big an warm. ian made us feel very welcome would stay again
Australia,Male,18-24,9,0,8,6,0,10,10,10,cool hostel.  a bit far from the beach and the main parts of venice but fun anyways.  dollar beers in the vending machine and friendly staff
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.7,0,6,8,0,10,10,8,"great with airport pickup, quick and easy wifi, great staff who could give you any information about places and activities. 20 - 30 min walk to venice beach, and very close to the bus-stop who would take you anywhere around. close to shops, cafe's and supermarkets.     i would deffenetly stay there agian!"
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,0,4,8,0,6,6,6,"well situated, 30 minutes walking from the beach. nice place if you want to rest"
Sweden,Female,18-24,4.3,0,2,8,0,4,2,6,dont stay here !! they dont have roomkeys and you might have to go in trough the window to get inside the frontdoor  a man checked us in who didnt really know who we were or what we were going to pay.   when you see this place you wouldn't want to stay there for more than 1 night tops.   the room was extremly cold! they didn't have any heating ( in januray..) and except from one man there wasn't anyone who really knew anything and they sat in the commonroom just drinking beer and smoked inside. not
France,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,0,8,8,0,10,6,6,old house turned into a hostel. staff incredibly friendly. 20/30 minute walk from venice beach. nice restaurants and cafes around (i strongly recommend the italian restaurant -- and i'm european! - ask the reception about it).
USA,Male,41+,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,i'm a regular there and its a good place to stay with cozy rooms upstairs. they just did new landscaping out front and it looks real nice.
Australia,Male,25-30,5,0,2,8,0,6,4,4,"they were doing work on the outside footpaths etc, but needs work on some of the simple things inside like locks on bathrooms. not for those who can't handle things being less than perfect but has potential."
USA,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the location is fantastic. it is a short walk to the beach and the pier and i very much enjoyed the ocean.    ian was on staff during my stay and he was very helpful in pointing out places where i could find some fun.     the wifi worked well so be sure to take your laptop.    be sure to visit the venice whaler it has an outdoor patio on the roof and the view of the ocean is great.    all the guests seemed like decent folks and it was quiet on the nights i was there.    i would definitely stay there again
France,Female,25-30,8.7,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,a very nice little hostel in venice! a bit oldish but ian the landlort was very helpful and great to chat to! we loved it! we even had a jacuzzi in our room for 2!!! how lush is that?! breakfast facilities in a good size kitchen very good! a bus from the airport just drop you by it nearly!very recommended!
Australia,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this hostel is in an ideal location - the staff are excellent - so friendly and helpful. as the area is so safe, you are able to really enjoy the nightlife in a great environment. the kitchen is well equiped and the rooms are comfortable. there are several bathrooms, and overall the experience is much more personal than the usual hostel experience. thank you so much for a lovely time in a fantastic area!   regards!"
NorthernIreland,Female,25-30,8,0,6,8,0,10,10,6,"this hostel is a really good, fun place to stay. i had a great time here. the staff are friendly and give good advice about the local area and attractions etc. it is 'old school' kind of hippy vibe to it and is really laid back. there are no locks on the doors (inc bathrooms)and it could do with a bit of updating (paint, new sheets etc) but for $27/night you really cant beat it. :d"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful staff and stay! this is my first time using podshare and it's way better than staying in a traditional hostel. this location is small but has everything you need and is situated perfectly between los feliz, silver lake, koreatown, and hollywood for all types of adventures. i'll definitely be staying here the next time i'm in la!"
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love amy and roger they was so friendly and nice 👍 and great they made me feel right at home 🏡 i will be back 
USA,Female,25-30,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,10,"pros: clean space, good location, one of the gals working there was sweet and helpful!  cons: no privacy curtain for bunks and not allowed to hang anything up (except on designated rack).  ""breakfast"" that is provided is clearly just stuff left behind by previous guests that are moved to the ""community"" pile.   the other gal who worked there had her boyfriend over the entire time and seemed annoyed when you asked her questions or interrupted their time together. did not make me feel welcomed."
Bulgaria,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"the hostel is nice, close to the metro station in quiet neighborhood. the girls working there are nice. all the people who visited during my stay were quiet and nobody bothers the rest of us. living in the same place with 9 more people sounds weird at first but then everything is okay? everyone respects the others. the only concern i have is the cleanliness of the place and also bedsheets didn't smell good."
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,10,10,10,2,"i loved this place, the moment i walked in i felt like i was at home. staff and atmosphere make it feel like you're with housemates- very open and social, i honestly made friends for life in just 1 night.   the only issue i have is that i was bitten by bed bugs so i would highly recommend shelving your beds but they are fixing this and i honestly think it shouldn't damper your experience because besides that this place is like no other hostel. you could always try their other locations too!"
Mexico,Male,25-30,6,6,10,8,6,2,2,8,"awesome design. death place. no atmosphere at all. a place to literally just rest. they are super strict about the rules, like beyond jail. "
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,8,10,8,8,"cool, clean, quiet place. not directly in the center of the city but it's only about a 15 minute ride to most places like downtown la. staff was awesome and helpful. would definitely stay here again. "
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,2,10,8,10,8,10,10,"beautiful and well designed one-room schoolhouse of a hostel. it has a rustic deep in the woods feeling which nicely contrasts with the urban environment outside. the pods are not true pods in the japanese way, but still very comfortable. however for a hostel it is a bit overpriced compared with other major cities in the world. it’s also not easily apparent who the staff are as there’s no real front desk so that can be a little awkward. if price isn’t a concern i say go for it."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed one night because i had to be at the hospital around the corner early in the morning. it was a perfect location. it was quiet during the day. in the evening things picked up a little bit. this hostel is an open concept space. the kitchen is within the same room as the ""pods"". bathroom &amp; shower room are off the kitchen. it was great for my needs. i do wish the pods truly were pods with enclosed walls and door. "
Canada,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,8,10,10,10,"good mix of the typical hostel atmosphere, with a more clean and comfortable set up. the ac keeps the place a great temperature, and the facilities in general feel very clean and new.  location is only a 15 minute drive to the griffith observatory, a short walk to the church of scientology, and a short drive to sunset. perfect for those who want to meet new people, but still get a good sleep every night (quiet time from 10pm onward)."
France,Male,25-30,3.7,4,6,2,4,4,4,2,the staff and detractors not honest and clear 
USA,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"you could not cancel, it was overbooked and the guy at the door could not operate a computer. nor could the guys spell your last name. i found him uninformative and i ended up going to a hotel..."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved staying here! we were only in la for 2 days and felt very comfortable leaving our things at the hostel while we toured. i loved how simple and small this hostel was. it felt much more intimate and safe since there were fewer people staying in the building. the bedding left a little to be desired. the sheets were jersey and the blanket was a little scratchy and not very warm. and the pillows were not very supportive at all. i would advise you bring a blanket and a pillow.
Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"nice and small place to stay, i liked the silver lake neighbourhood very much."
Finland,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is my home away from home. the best hostel ever! the beds are amazing, so comfy and different from anything i have seen in a hostel. don't worry about the stuff they write about being social and the tattoos people get. it's not that that crazy. people are pretty regular and you can spend time with them or not. when i was there, it wasn't super social. "
Canada,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,can i live here forever? best hostel ever! :)
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was very pleased with all aspects of this hostel. it was clean, secure and had friendly competent staff. great for those looking for a quieter hostel, interesting layout and nicely decorated. would certainly stay there again. "
Italy,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"very nice place, cosy and essential, good atmosphere"
Norway,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a great stay😀 would definitely stay here next time in coming to l.a! this is a gem!!!   highly recommended!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"thank you! i've already booked to stay again! this is a beautifully hidden gem with wonderful staff! just on the corner nearby you can also get a philly cheesestake that's amazing! the pods each have netflix, there are only 10beds in the whole place so you don't need to worry about too many people and everyone is friendly and welcoming. it's the best bed in a hostel i've ever had! so comfortable and everything is clean. there is communal food as well as room for your own things in the fridge. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"this might be one of the the best hostel experiences i've had so far!  cosy beds and a beautifull room for about 10 people, well equipped kitchen and very good cleanliness overall.  everything is basically in one room, so you have to respect the nighttime.  you also have your own tv that's offering netflix and other similar providers.  the staff was friendly and helpful and always around for a nice talk.  the location is quite good near a metro station and placed between hollywood and downtown.    "
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"i only slept there....nice shoer, bathroom bunk.....i'd stay again gladly."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,6,8,10,8,8,10,"very clean and unique place. my first night was very quiet, but on my second night there were a few noisy people. very interesting set up and great value!"
HongKong,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,4,8,10,"it would be great for guests to call and confirm the booking more than once - even i was confirmed that i would have a twin bed, only a single bed was given to me that day. the staff was not very helpful in resolving the problem and was not well-tempered - one of the staff there even threatened to evict me rather than having the problem dealt with.     but other than the mishap the beds were comfortable and the amenities provided were adequate, but shower gel ran out and no one replaced it."
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,"no bells and whistles here, just a nice to place to rest after a long day in l.a. the amenities are nice and conveniently close to the metro and buses. the only problem is leaving the door open at night where passerbys can see inside and it also gets rather cold at night."
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"this was a great place to stay. the pod idea is really cool! it's nice to have you own space! it's a very quiet place which is nice, the only draw back is there is only one toilet, one shower, and one bathroom sink shared between 10 people. the people are great and the area is safe (i ran early in the morning and walked after dark) and lots really conviently located! great coffee shops, bars, food in the area as well as old movie theaters and easily get to hollywood, downtown, and up to the hill"
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"it says there is parking on hostel world... there is no parking. fyi.   you cannot drive there. you can get close, but you can't park close (about 0.5 mile)   otherwise, cool location and nice people. bunks are very old and provided pillows could be better (just roll up a sweatshirt).  the beach is right there. there are also a series of good smelling restaurants nearby and a great ambiance. "
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,10,10,6,4,"the location is perfect, the staff is super sweet and the breakfast is also great (for a hostel breakfast) we didn't have an ac in our room but since we stayed there in winter it wasn't that bad, but in summer i probably wouldn't have booked this hostel without an ac. the mattresses were very old and uncomfortable but i guess they were currently working on that."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"great place to relax and chill, very close to the beach and easy to get around. staff are friendly and facilities are good. overall atmosphere seemed quiet but otherwise it is safe and comfortable."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the staff at the hostel was really nice and i could leave my luggage there because i arrived before check-in time. the location is great, super close to the beach. there are nice houses next to the beaches and i had the feeling that this area is great for families as well. the rooms were okay but the bathroom was shared and on the hallway. also i did not like the breakfast. there was only toast and peanutbutter, i would appreciate anything else to eat. but in general, i enjoyed my stay there :)"
Finland,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,a great location by the beach in an area with lots of restaurants and bars to choose from. the hostel was a bit run down and the noise from the bar below was unbearable. i figured a monday night in december would be quiet but it wasn't. carla was friendly and changed our room to the top floor where we were able to sleep with the help of earplugs and were greeted by a stunning beach scenery in the morning. it's a nice hostel but keep in mind the noise and that there is no free parking on-site.
India,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,just stay here for the location. this hostel probably has the best view ever. waking up you can see the ocean and the activity of the pier. since it is right on the pier it is at the heart all the action. also hermosa beach is one of the most beautiful beaches ever. staff was super friendly too.
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,6,8,10,10,excellent lodging experience  with a location that can't be beat
USA,Female,31-40,6.3,8,6,10,6,4,6,4,"the location was good. i stayed for 5 nights while visiting friends nearby. my hostel roommate was absolutely incorrigible; immediately started insulting me right when i got there.  i really liked the older guy that cleaned was great. i wasn't impressed by the nighttime staff, particularly when i had to check out at 1am on my final night there. the other clientele there were alright . the place isn't so clean, but for the money i would probably stay there again."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"lovely staff, well located and the thanksgiving dinner they put on was excellent "
Algeria,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"thank you christian. thank you chris and thanks to the lady (i should've asked her for her name at least ... silly me).  i only stayed for one night, but the least i can say, is that it was great.  i was supposed to check-in at 9pm but my flight got delayed so i checked in at like 11pm thanks to christian.  i had no cash at all. you are supposed to make a 10$ deposit for the key and you'll get it back at the checkout.  i had no internet, so the girl and chris printed and helped me with the map."
Belgium,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,10,4,8,6,6,only stayed on night. location is great if you don’t mind the possible niose from the nightlife. not the newest place but nothing to complain about.
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,2,4,8,6,4,4,6,no staff at office when we arrived for check in. another individual slept in a booked bed which left my friend high and dry.    have overnight staff for security and help late at night.
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,10,6,6,8,was a very nice stay for just one night
Netherlands,Female,31-40,6.6,6,6,10,4,8,8,4,"rather dirty, and its pretty worn down. they don't have many kitchen facilities, there is probably a lot of food waste because they don't have a 'free' shelf, but other than that it's a very social place to stay!"
Japan,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"the good:  - location. literally in the hermosa beach pier!  - price. facilities show wear and tear, but can't complain about it for the price!  - cool clientele. mostly surfers and hippies.    the bad:  - wifi is not reachable except the rooms close to the common area. i had to move.  - loud noise from the street. earplugs are a must.  - not so clean, especially in the bathrooms."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,it's a backpacker's hostel right on beautiful hermosa beach. staff are friendly and laid back. accomodations are basic but mostly clean. the beach is close (though you may have to walk through a film set to get there). what more do you need?
England,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,"great location, nice safe neighborhood :)"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,8,8,10,10,6,8,6,8,"awesome location if u wanted to stay nearby the beach town.. partying noise goes all night thru early hours as expected from tuesday night onwards so take headphones, place could do with revamp but you get what you pay for n owners r very welcoming "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,second time i have stayed at surf city and i can't wait to come back again. it's in a perfect location (right on the beach) surrounded by great restaurants and an exciting night life. common areas always had people popping in and was a great place to make new friends. for a solo traveler this was ideal. made some great friends from around the globe and we had some great memories. kitchen was well kept and facilities were all working. really sad to see odile leave though! will miss her!
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,6,10,10,2,8,4,10,"no atmosphere or common areas, no airconditioning or fans in the rooms. the shower has no head so it comes out in one straight beam which genuinely hurts.    everything else was fine; bed was comfortable enough, staff were nice although not particularly accommodating. great location."
Lithuania,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,loud music at night.breakfast erm.... ;^)  but overall good ;)
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,my stay at the hostile was a great experience. the staff was friendly and helpful. i met alot of nice people staying here.  it was in a great location that you could walk anywhere and get whatever you needed. the beach is just out your door. i would stay here again !
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,location was great under a minute walk to the beach. very helpful and accommodating. rooms were very hot and music played late but can't really complain since it was a holiday weekend and in the middle of a heat wave. overall would definitely stay here again and great value for money
USA,Male,41+,8,8,6,10,6,10,10,6,great location near hermosa beach pier. i mean about 50 yards. bathrooms should be cleaned better.     really nice and interesting clientele.     my second time here.     
England,Male,31-40,6.9,6,6,10,8,4,6,8,"great location right on the beach and amongst the lively bars and nightlife of hermosa. there is a small communal area but not a massive place to chill out, but then again the beach is right on your door step.  staff weren't always around and we did have to wait a long-time to check in."
Italy,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"if you're looking to be 1)close to the beach 2)in a relaxed environment 3)away from the hustle and bustle of the posh side of la -&gt; this place is for you.  location is an easy 10/10. everything one might need is close-by ( sunday markets, bank, supermarket, bottle shop, bars cafes pubs restaurants).   do buy ear plugs if noise is an issue as the hostel overlooks the main street in hermosa beach aka where the weekend nightlife happens."
England,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"i've travelled the us and this is my favourite hostel. the atmosphere, staff and location were brilliant! great value for money. "
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the area where the hostel is located is a big night spot so if you want to get to be early on a weekend earplugs are highly suggested!!!!  
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"this was my second time staying here, and i can't wait to go back for a third. i had a view of the beach, and love the vibes here. totally worth it."
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,4,10,6,6,"good for a crash pad, not much else. it was hard to find, and parking was harder. i had to ask someone where it was and as a solo traveler, that's not my favorite thing to do at night. (it's between two restaurants, the waterman is on the right). parking was either really close and expensive or really far and free.  the dorm rooms were small and un- air conditioned and the mattress was very uncomfortable. but the people who ran it were sweet and the location was ideal. you get what you pay for. "
Chile,Male,31-40,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,just one night. can't say much
China,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"it's a nice place. location is convenient,closed to the beach. people are very friendly. rooms are clean and breakfasts are good. i would stay at there again."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"honestly one of the nicest hostels i've been to ever. everyone was so genuinely kind and easy going. the area itself is wicked and to be surrounded by a fair amount of locals as you walk through the town centre gives you a fair idea of what it'd be like to live in california, and i hope the idea you form is of a positive one, because i know it was for me.     thanks again guys, i'll definitely be back before i head off to my next destination in a year's time.     lockie "
Germany,Male,25-30,5.1,4,2,6,6,8,6,4,"biggest pain point: only 3 lockers in 6 bed dorm! lockers are cheap and certainly important (passport, credit cards, ...). should be a no-brainer to provide as many as beds are in dorms.  furthermore: wifi only in kitchen area. not as many power outlets as in other hostels. no lamps at beds. bathrooms/kitchen only semi-clean.    i still slept well and had a pleasant time in la. there are certainly better hostels though."
England,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,great location
England,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"i stayed at surf city for 6 days and thought the the staff and the hostel were exactly what you want from a basic chilled out surf hostel. everyone is incredibly friendly and willing to help you at every opportunity, i felt very much at home for my week that i spent there. i will definitely return to surf city!  "
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,6,8,8,6,room wasn't as cleaned/nice as i would have thought it would be.   bin not empty and top bunk had no sheets on it which revealed an ugly brown stain.   staff were friendly and helpful. 
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic overall! the only things i would change would be to add enough lockers so each bed has one available (in my room, there were six beds but only three lockers). also, from a security perspective, suggest making the door to the hostel is not left propped open. other than that, had an exceptional stay!"
USA,Male,41+,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,4,8,"i stayed a friday night. the location with so many food &amp; drink places, near to the water, was fantastic. however, rather than hearing the ocean at night, i heard the crash of workers dumping empty bottles into recycling bins until 2-3am. *crash* i had an early morning surf competition and didn't sleep so well. if i were into staying up and partying, this place can't be beat. for a nights sleep, i think i'd be better at motel 6 or something.  "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this place. it's clean and it just has everything you never knew you needed. hammocks, surfboard rentals, orange juice and bagels for breakfast and lots more. whatever you are looking for- you gonna find it here for sure :)   "
Australia,Male,41+,8,6,8,10,8,10,8,6,"awesome spot just out of the city. loud bars down stairs on the weekend, right on the beach loved the area. close to airport "
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,perfect location
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,6,8,10,4,8,4,4,"amazing location!!!  other than that, nothing special, and actually quite gross.  bathrooms are ""clean"" but they feel so dirty and old and neglected.  i don't mind old if it's well maintained.  the bathrooms are just so gross.  i never went barefoot here, not even in the shower.  beds are fine.  kitchen fine.  bike rental is a rip off from here, you can get it cheaper (and more expensive) at other places.  umbrellas available :) "
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved the friendly staff!  the breakfast was delicious!  i loved the hot coffee in the morning!  my bed was comfy!    i didn't like the band playing music until 2am on a tuesday night!
Uruguay,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stayed at this hostel 5 times  and i will stay again
USA,Female,18-24,6.6,8,8,10,4,6,6,4,"super awesome location on hermosa beach, which makes this hostel really great. it wasn't very clean, though, and very stuffy at night. "
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,we loved surf city hostel so much that we would do anything to go back! by far the friendliest staff i have ever met. they have surf boards and body boards and volleyballs and bikes for super cheap rental prices that make for a perfect vacation. the location was perfect. couldn't have been happier. we loved the hostel so much we wanted to cook our meals in the kitchen with the other guests instead of going out to eat. thank you!!
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the hostel. very simple, but has everything you need in a place to sleep and take a shower. place just like the photos show, staff very friendly and helpful. surf city hostel is literally 200ft from the beach with great restaurants and bars just downstairs. great vibe, would stay again!"
India,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,"overall it was a great place to stay with a friendly staff, right off the beach! i will definitely stay here again!"
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,8,6,6,4,6,4,6,"just be aware that this building is very worn out and run down and uncomfortable. it is directly over a bar that gets loud at night, and there is no air conditioning, so the noise comes in the window from directly below you. or you could shut the window and sweat. the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i've tried to sleep on since i was in the army, and i've stayed in many hostels. yes, it's right on the beach, but that's the only benefit. "
USA,Male,18-24,8,10,8,10,6,8,6,8,"stayed here for one night, before catching a flight out of lax. if you're looking for a cheap hostel in a great area of la, this is probably your best option. the 232 bus can get you to lax in about 30 minutes, which is impressive for la. staff was very nice, helpful, and made sure i had everything i needed. not sure if it's the just culture in la, but the hostel was not a community presence, which is a huge drawback. i wouldn't recommend this hostel to someone looking to truly experience la."
USA,Female,18-24,4.6,6,8,6,4,2,2,4,"the staff member who was checking guests in on the afternoon of july 3 was taking phone calls over checking in two different guests who had bags in hand and were waiting for a room key. i waited 20 minutes to be shown my room two doors over, because a customer on the phone without a reservation could not figure out booking.com. the wait was way too long. "
Germany,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, couldn't believe how close it was to the ocean! never imagined myself to sleep in la and hearing the sea breeze as the beach was directly in front of my window. only minus might be the fact that the stairs are quite steep and there is no elevator - hard for people like me who are travelling with an overzied suitcase. but i couldnt be more happy with my stay."
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,excellent location. unbeatable for.the price. 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"first thing is the location is incredible, maybe not if you want to be near la or hollywood but as i was just wanting good vibes and beach, incredible. had an amazing view of the beach and pier from my room. great vibe at the hostel and the city of hermosa. the first day i hired a bike and cruised the 25mile ride up to santa monica and back. very glad i didn't stay in venice. just be aware that the hostel is on top of a strip of bars. awesome, awesome bars. highly recommend"
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,loved it! the location is just perfect. 
England,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,8,10,8,"we made so many friends at this hostel! the location was great right be the beach and restaurants and bars, the showers could do with some love though, the staff were great apart from one middle eastern guy in the evenings who didn't seem to enjoy people having fun. would stay here again though "
Hungary,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"everything was really great, better than expected to be honest. i would definitely recommend it to anyone and would stay here again myself. "

USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i had a great time staying here! the staff made me feel super welcome, as well as the other guests. everyone was very approachable so it was easy to meet new people. the location was awesome, right on the beach and near bars, shops, and restaurants. this was my first time stat staying at a hostel, so i was a little nervous. even though i was traveling alone, i knew i could make friends nearby. "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,6,10,10,8,great staff and awesome location. if you want to be in hemorsa this your spot. it is only a 20 minute ride from lax. can be a little noisy on the weekends but still worth it. would stay here again!
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,10,8,4,"communication leading up to my arrival in la was not good because i had to change my arrival date and the confirmation emails from the staff were unclear as to whether they understood my request. however, upon arrival, the staff was wonderful! i had a late flight and the car rental office was so slow and i was going to miss the deadline for when the hostel office closed but the staff on duty kept it open until i arrived. very, very kind and accommodating!"
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,7.7,10,8,10,4,10,8,4,"super friendly staff. amazing location. it was not dirty, but not super clean either. a great place to stay."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,trulia.com safe neighborhood  good reviews  great bar street  right on pier
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, right by the pier. fun party atmosphere especially when it's fiesta hermosa! it can get quite noisy so if you don't like parties or loud music then it's not really for you. "
USA,Female,25-30,8,10,8,6,6,10,10,6,"this place is very friendly! however, i did not realize it was on top of a very noisy bar/restaurant. my bunk bed vibrated til 2am each night from the music and people in the bar. if you can sleep through anything, this place is perfect for you! i did love that we were a few steps from the ocean and that the staff were so friendly! "
USA,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"the hostel had a great position, i could see the ocean from my window. the stuff was very kind and helpful! the room was not super clean but overall i had a great experience. highly recommended! "
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"very nice staff, best location.  the 3 south la beach towns are great and you don't need to have a car.  bus or uber is fine.  pier av. is a hotbed of activity, lots of restaurants, cafes, shops, etc.  staff is super-nice."
Ireland,Female,31-40,8.9,6,10,10,8,10,10,8,really good hostel right beside the beach and shops. excellent location and excellent breakfast. staff very helpful.  bikes are really good value at $15 for 24 hours.
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"awesome location right on the pier esplanade !  very clean and friendly , good vibes !! "
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"location is what makes this hostel amazing. it's not on the beach, but it's maybe 50 feet away. i was in the large dorm style room on the second floor. the room had its own bathroom/ shower and a closet- which was really nice. they also have a few bathroom/ shower combos in the hall in case the one in your room is taken. i can't comment much about the free breakfast/ common areas, because i stayed out late and came back early as i spent most of the time with a friend that lives in hermosa beach."
France,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,really nice and friendly hostel right by the beach (50 meters). the only inconvenience is to get there and to go to other places in la. you always have to take a long public transport journey if you don't have a car.
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,8,6,8,6,8,8,2,"staff was friendly. nice breakfast available. $15 bike rental which is a good deal. bring ear plugs because the area is noisy, right next to a bunch of bars. the bedrooms need to be cleaned better. don't forget to vacuum under the beds, there were a bunch of old papers and trash under mine. the windowsills were super dusty and the bathrooms were not that clean.  "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice place to stay for one night, great location and friendly staff. 20 minute drive from the airport - lots of cafes and shops around! "
Canada,Female,18-24,4.3,4,4,8,2,8,2,2,"the people who run this place are nice, but after traveling and using hostels in europe, asia, and north america, this is probably the dirtiest, loudest hostel i have been to. i arrived at 11:30pm, the hostel entrance was difficult to find - a very drunk gentleman who was staying at the hostel let me in. the parking area was a mile away from the hostel, which didn't help since we had to walk through the pouring rain to get back. thank god we were there for the night, left at 7am the next day."
USA,Male,41+,3.7,2,2,10,2,6,2,2,extremely load and unruly. outside doors were kept unlocked. location next to a music bar---load. will never stay at this hostel again.   i would suggest no alcohol allowed and quite policy after 10:00pm. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is amazing, it is an incredible price for such a great location right on the beach. the owner is extremely welcoming and helpful. would recommend to anyone looking to stay in la! "
Germany,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"super great hostel! i stayed here alone for only one night, and could directly connect with other ppl. my room had even an own bathroom, with sea view what was pretty amazing. the only negative thing is that there was not real common area. well, yes there was a very small  room with a table and a bench and also next to the kitchen was a small ""common area"", but it was more like everyone does what he has to do. not like, chilling together and going out together.    "
USA,Female,25-30,4.9,4,4,10,4,4,4,4,"dirty, rude employees, weird setup and security, no common areas. didn't have a good hostel vibe. been all over, and to dozens of hostels and this is in the top 3 worst i've been in, outside of the awesome location on the pier."
Norway,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great location, great athmosphere! so many different people to hang out with, and with the beach so close, there is always something to do.. it's the basic hostel where to hang out with other travelers, and get to know new people. slept through every night with ease."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"really great vibe, terrific location, next to the ocean. really enjoyed myself!!"
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,8,6,8,6,6,8,6,"surf city is your basic hostel. the breakfast was fantastic--such a plus. the location in hermosa beach was great, but a little inconvenient for all of la. getting around was really hard and expensive. an uber to downtown la was around $40 one way, and just to venice beach it was $20. though hermosa beach was fun to explore, if you want to see more of la i would suggest staying somewhere else. the hostel itself was fairly clean but pretty noisy. definitely a party hostel but easy to meet people."
USA,Male,41+,4,4,6,6,2,4,4,2,i suggest you visit a quality hostel or two and go to school on how they do things. i would never recommend yours as it is now.
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, great people, great location - right next to pier in hermosa!"
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,6,10,10,8,6,10,"the location was perfect. lots of shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. the pier to the beach is literally right outside the front door. bike rentals shop one block away.  i made amazing friends here, many of whom were in their late 20s-early 30s. the owner was friendly and worked to make sure everyone was enjoying their visit throughout my time there. breakfast and coffee every day, beautiful communal living room with view of the ocean and lots of books to read."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean, well kept, hospitable, accommodating, great location! a+!"
Australia,Male,31-40,4.9,4,4,10,4,4,4,4,"this hostel, whilst being in a top location is quite dated. wifi barely works in the rooms. the place just feels dirty. on top of this the management is questionable at best. i paid for a ""private"" room yet on return one night i found 2 people sleeping in my room with my stuff thrown into a pile on the floor. i complained and was practically brushed. unacceptable behaviour. i wouldn't stay here again"
USA,Male,18-24,4,2,8,2,2,6,2,6,"this is by far the worst hostel i have ever stayed at. the hostel sits conveniently above a bar, which likes to play thumping club music until 1am. so if you're looking for a place to sleep, you might want to look elsewhere. oh, and when i say thumping, i mean it. not only can you clearly hear the music (not quiet), but the bass is turned up so much that you feel it. i was told that this only happens on fridays and saturdays, so on weekdays you might be safe. still, an unacceptable surprise."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,i really enjoyed staying at the surf city hostel . there were always somebody to talk to and when there was another woman accidentally  sleeping in my bed at 1 am in the morning . the quickly figured out a new solution . i would definitely come back !
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8, i stayed there couple of days n a week after i came back for more few days.   i needed 3 days however my flight back home was during the night so i woudn't sleep there in my last day. they aloud me to pay half price  wich was very nice.  good stuff:  - good free breakfast;    - plenty bars n good fun around;    - close to the beach;    - bathrooms are fine;    - good shower;    - fine internet.    - friendly staff    not so good things:  - weak wifi signal inside the bedrooms;    
India,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,8,4,"this was my second stay at the surf city, i enjoyed my first stay and there were no complaints on the second either, the cleanliness was lacking this time, the toilet and bath could have been cleaner, the place needs a new coat of paint and a little ""loving"". every thing else was just fine.  "
Germany,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, right at the beach, with lots of bars and restaurants around the corner. "
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"pretty doozy joint ah, right on the beach and plenty of little bars and stuff around. venice and manhatten beach aren't too far either "
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,10,10,10,6,8,6,8,great location!
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,6,10,"hostel was very good. not a real lot of atmosphere there in the winter being mainly a summer beach place but that is to be expected i suppose. facilities seemed clean, staff were helpful and free breakfast was good. "
USA,Female,41+,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,10,8,the clientele is great. mostly 20 somethings who were surprisingly welcoming. international. run by a french lady who keeps an eye on things. 4 to a room. no problems there. band plays right downstairs and can be heard outside the window. had no problems but good to take a suitcase lock. sound canceling headphones or earplugs.  winter? pjs long underwear/jacket/sock/ personal throw the rooms can get chilly.  bedding and towels provided. the location is very convenient.
England,Male,25-30,8,10,8,10,8,6,6,8,the hostel is in a great location- right on the beach with plenty of bars nearby.  very relaxed atmosphere in hermosa as it is very affluent- a no-smoking law is enforced in the entire area so great to get away from smokey terraces.  i met a lovely girl at a bar down the strip and tried to bring her back to the hostel room but got massively c*ck blocked by one of the staff members who essentially kicked the girl out.  i'll let you judge for yourself whether this is a good or bad thing.    
USA,Female,25-30,4.6,4,4,8,4,6,4,2,"tiny, dingy, disgusting. i was there 5 minutes and couldn't believe my eyes. the female dorm was absolutely appalling, falling apart, ceiling coming down, broken blinds, stuff and garbage everywhere, looked like sloppy people lived there year round3 inch half a cheap mattress. i couldn't even bring myself to put my stuff down. i asked to just leave and get my money back. 6 ft tiny kitchen fridge with door open.. ouldn't refund even though it was sold out, but gave me a depressing, cold private."
India,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place has got erything i'd look for in a hostel- safety, great friendship, staff, facilities, beautiful location. the staff is willing to take the extra mile for the hostel residents. i would not think twice before staying here again. i can assure a safe, secure and happy stay to anyone reading this."
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"what an amazing destination! hard to get closer to the beach! great location for bars, food and shopping. post office and grocery near by. the staff is wonderful and welcoming! lots of activities, beach toys, bike rides, group dinners and nights out just to name a few. the whole place was very clean and linens were provided. the main doors in are left open most of the time. didn't seem to be a problem but i would recommend having a pad lock, they provide you with a locker for storage. "
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"great location, decent staff. could be cleaner."
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"location, location, location!  my first time in a hostel, it was a wonderful experience.  people were friendly and interesting.  i could not have made up a more convenient location:  restaurants, surfing, volleyball, the pier, the beach and shopping.  lots of things to do and see, all within walking distance.  very relaxing.  perfect.  i felt safe with my roommates, in the building and all around.  building is worn, but clean.  i was only there a few days, but felt like i had a week's vacation."
USA,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,wonderful weekend get away. will definitely be back soon.
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,4,8,8,4,6,4,4,"incredibly loud, impossible to sleep. "

USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i'm in that area of los angeles once a year and i stay there every time.  the staff are friendly and, surprisingly, they remember me each time i check in.  that's pretty cool :)"
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel &amp; its location! i stayed in a clean &amp; tidy women's 6-person dorm in a corner room with a view of the sunset &amp; beach. the best room! the only cons were the street noise that faded around midnight &amp; the flight of stairs one must climb to enter the hostel (not normally an issue unless you are traveling with a touring bike, 4 panniers and 50 lbs of weight).  my bike was welcomed &amp; stored in the hall next to my room (locked to itself). i felt safe. everyone was friendly.   "
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,great location right next to hermosa beach pier and amongst the local bars. easily walk or ride to manhattan or redondo beach and surrounding areas. comfortable and clean. 
Netherlands,MixedGroup,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,really good location right at the beach. nice staff and good atmosphere! unfortunately the wifi was bad and the beds not so comfortable. the showers and toilets are used by quite a lot of people so not always really clean. 
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,6,10,10,10,8,8,amazing location right on the beach. place is a little run down but adds to its overall charm. literally 30 seconds from the ocean. awesome way to start the day. oh and it has free breakfast
Argentina,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,the hostel was good. the only really bad thing for me was my matress (i could feel the springs on my back) and there was a chimney of a restaurant that pointed straight to our room window so it smelled like grilled beef the whole day. otherwise ww were hot dead.
Austria,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"all in all it's a great hostel! nice stuff, nice breakfast, 1 min walk from the beach, nice locations with many restaurants, bars and some shops. public transport very close."
Hungary,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,proper backpackers vibe. excellent location. highly recommend 
Australia,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,the location can't be beat. you can hire surfboards and bicycles. bike ride from hostel to santa monica pier was my highlight..see the sunset from hermosa pier amazing..the staff were very nice and extremely helpful.met a couple of really nice people there  hate the plastic sheet on mattress in hostels makes bead uncomfortable and hot..breakfast was great would stay again for sure 
England,Female,31-40,4.9,2,6,10,2,6,4,4,lack of ac and poor wi-fi. dodgy/loose electrical wiring and only one socket per room for four people. i would expect better for the price. 
England,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,6,6,10,8,8,bit difficult for me to review as i spent literally 8 or 9 hours there but the staff were really friendly and helpful and make the effort to show you around even when you arrive at midnight. rooms are a bit cramped but seemed pretty clean and there seemed to be a pretty good vibe overall. hostel is right by the beach and wish i could've stayed longer
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,"space under bunks need cleaned. when 6 women share a restroom, it would be a good idea to have extra roll of tissue in restroom."

NewZealand,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,4,8,6,4,"great place to stay if you&amp;#39;re on a budget and just want to enjoy the beach. really basic, and my room and bathroom weren&amp;#39;t very clean, but does the trick for a couple days. no huge complaints, was happy to be there and knew what i was getting myself into."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,the staff were by far the best part of the whole experience! very friendly and talkative and always willing to help! big shout out to them all!! the location was amazing and the facilities met hostel standards. overall a very happy stay! :) apart from coming back to find someone else was in my bed on the second night- being moved to a different room that wasn&amp;#39;t with my friend i am travelling with because of a booking error. i was able to move back in the end however so no biggy
Turkey,Female,25-30,7.4,4,10,8,8,8,8,6,"everything was quite great though as a person from europe and who always stays in hostels, this was the most expensive hostel i&amp;#39;ve ever stayed. i never payed more than 15$ for a dorm room for way bigger and better hostels in europe. i understand that it&amp;#39;s a business that is not as established and common as in europe in the united states but still i feel hostels can attract more people in the states if they keep their prices a little lower. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place is perfect. i was traveling with 4 of my buddies and the location is amazing. the hostel is super close to the beach and amazing bars. the beds were decent and the staff were great. i would definitely recommend this hostel to anyone traveling and hopping around california. 
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"had an amazing time at this hostel. it can be loud but if you are looking for party at night then chill at the beach all day this is the best place to be. plenty of opportunity to surf, paddle board, body board, go on a bike ride and/or tan.   staff are all super friendly and accommodating. i&amp;#39;ll definitely be returning.   (i don&amp;#39;t recommend this hostel if you are under 21) "

Ireland,Female,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,had a really great stay here. the location is great. hermosa beach is fantastic. it can get a bit loud at night with all bars close by but mainly on the weekend. you can rent bikes and surfboards for a very reasonable price. i would definitely stay here again. 
USA,Male,18-24,4.9,4,4,8,4,2,8,4,"surf city hostel boasts a certain price then charges a lot more, they nickel and dimed me til i was broke and refused to give me back my security deposit claiming that it was spread out among my party when they paid for their rooms"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i absolutely loved staying here! i was only in town for three days for a personal vacation and this was a great place to stay! the staff were extremely friendly, the facilities were well managed and clean, and the atmosphere was very chill! i really enjoyed the friendly environment and it was in a great location just off the venice beach boardwalk! if you are planning a trip to the area, i would highly recommend staying here! "
Sweden,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"super friendly staff in the reception. great location by the beach. simple, clean and a welcoming atmosphere. i&amp;#39;ll be back! 10/10"

NewZealand,Male,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"as always, excellent."
Canada,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"was my first time in a hostel and i couldn&amp;#39;t be happier. better than expected, perfect location. right above the party spot on the beach, gets a little loud with the bass from the bars but as long as you aren&amp;#39;t there to sleep all night it&amp;#39;s perfect! oh and there&amp;#39;s beach volleyball everywhere, not to mention 2 minutes walk to the ocean."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great party hostel on the beach. very relaxed and social atmosphere. the &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; outside is very casual. if you want to drink and party then it&amp;#39;s fantastic. not for someone wanting quiet time. for being so close to lax it takes a long time on public transport. next time i will just cab/uber.
China,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,swell experience!

Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,10,4,10,10,10,10,4,amazing place. you get yo meet lots of new ppl and i looove thr staff so kind hearted and welcoming. only disadvantage was its nit the cleanest place and we found both live and dead cockroaches in the room 😐
Italy,Male,31-40,7.4,6,6,8,6,8,10,8,"it&amp;#39;s a very basic hostel with a very basic and squeaky bunk bed, security is not great, because there is one locker where you can fit a laptop sized backpack (not those for backpackers!) electricity plugs are scarce and far, but they exist :)  price: definitely not cheap, if you think that a motel costs just a tad more with way higher comfort.    the plus is the awesome breakfast, the location -- literally next to the beach and to a handful of restaurants, bars and pubs --, and the hostel-life!"
Israel,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome place, right on the beach, nice pubs under the hostel, love the place and the vibe will stay hear again for sure ! nice reception, good facilitiys, have all you need. the parking is couple street up but its look like a safe nighberhood."
France,Male,25-30,5.4,4,4,10,4,6,4,6,"incredible location offset by a poor management of the hostel.  there is a lack of security (3 lockers for 4 beds for example, entrance door open until late with no one filtering the access during the day...).  worst breakfast ever. just do not provide this kind of breakfast, what is the point?  the hostel would need to be freshened up. at least painting and carpets. probably 10 years without works done.   noisy people when i was there and no one from the staff to ask them to be quiet. "
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,surf city hostel has a vibe of cool people and this was one of the best hostel stays i&amp;#39;ve had.
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,2,2,10,10,2,10,10,"no late check-in.  i tried to check in at 11pm (23h00). someone buzzed me into the hostel (weak security) and yet no one could help me check in. i talked to plenty of people.   all of them were very friendly people but none of them worked there. i could not find an employee of this hostel.  no one was at the office. i ended up sleeping in my car.   to be clear, the people and location are great.   however, the existence of nessie, big foot and surf city hostel staff members are dubious at best. "
England,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,"we loved this hostel! staff were very helpful and friendly, location is really good, the free breakfast is great! couple of things worth noting, our room was really hot until they could find us a fan and after one of us got locked out of our room we found out that other people&amp;#39;s keys could unlock our door..but we never felt nervous about leaving our things there :) overall really good stay in hermosa!"
Germany,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,nice location close to the beach!  nice staff and very clean.  bar underneath very loud during the night.
England,Male,25-30,7.1,8,4,10,6,6,8,8,"amazing location on the beach and by all the bars - you really don&amp;#39;t have far to walk for anything. however, any member of public could easily walk in and do whatever. certainly less touristy compared to venice/santa monica and hollywood where i also stayed.  was put in a room with two who were on a work/stay vacation, they took over the entire room. couldn&amp;#39;t use a locker as only 3 for a 4 bed room and one was being used to store their drinks! beds aren&amp;#39;t great. need more planned activities"
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.9,10,6,10,10,10,10,6,it was so good. it was welcoming and had a really great atmosphere. the only thing i has an issue with was there was only 3 lockers but 4 beds and as i was last in the room i had no place to store my valuables and ended up sleeping with them instead but really great location! i will be back.   stored my luggage as check out was before i was leaving and even let me rent a bike to pass the time. 100% will stay again. 
USA,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"surf city in a very fine hostel. excellent. right off the beach, not too noisy at night. staff helpful: found me a free parking place for my car, although there is a pay parking place right behind, gave me extra comforter when i said i was cold, offered cheap bike rental and concerned all was well. hostelrrs are friendly and considerate. no one kept me up at night, and hermosa beach is great! i had a fabulous stay!"
England,Male,31-40,5.1,4,4,10,4,4,4,6,the receptionist in the morning was not helpful. rooms should have been cleaner. 
Switzerland,Male,25-30,5.7,4,6,10,4,8,4,4,"it is okay to charge more because you are located better than trump could afford it, but i guess even he would not try to build a hostel over a nightclub.  or if, at least he would take some money, because the prices are high enough, and get the place modernised, organised. a kitchen where at least a third of the guests would fit and a table for the dining room. take away the alcohol and the &amp;#39;medicine&amp;#39; from the workers and install some fans that work propperly!  not recommended."
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,this was a great hostel to stay at! i had originally booked 10 days but only needed to stay 5. the staff was great about allowing me to pay per night and although i lost my deposit i didn&amp;#39;t get charged for the days i had previously booked!   it&amp;#39;s rather small so easy to meet people. the locations is amazing which made our visit to la easy and enjoyable! the only thing i would make note of is that the hostel is right above a bunch of bars! so if you want quiet this might not be the place for you.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.6,6,6,10,10,10,8,10,good hostel you couldn't get any closer to the beach awesome
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved this hostel. the people were friendly and the atmosphere was great. the beds were nothing to write home about, but have you ever slept in a comfortable hostel bed? nope. i would definitely stay here again. "
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"great place. awesome location. helpful staff. great atmosphere. only improvements would be aircon, it gets a bit warm in the rooms with only a fan and wifi doesn't work in the rooms. would definitely stay there again."
Russia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the hostel and location were fantastic! located right on the beach in a quirky pedestrian neighbourhood, there was a right balance of chilling out and always having things to do. surf boards, body boards, bicycles, roller skates were available for rental, and there always were other travellers eager to join in. the atmosphere is great too, as the hostel is pretty small, so it felt like being part of a family of other travellers. it&amp;#39;s a bit far from the downtown, but you can get there with uber."
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,6,10,6,"great location! old building. staff was very kind but forgetful. they did not give us sheets or towels when we checked in. we had to return to the office multiple times to get these basic necessities. there was an in room bathroom which was excellent but the sink would not drain properly. we told the front desk days before our stay ended but the problem was not fixed. all in all, would stay again. exellent location makes up for sub-par service. "
Brazil,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed at. the manager is so nice and helpful. the staff is also very helpful and friendly. its located in front of the beach. nice free breakfast. the rooms are pretty clean. the common areas are very good for socializing. there&amp;#39;s a lot going on on pier ave during the day and at night, so ii&amp;#39;s definitely a good place to go out. "
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,6,10,10,10,"nice hostel to stay at the beach.  for days you want to rest, go on a walk ore swim in the ocean.   a good place for playing beach volleyball.   "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"first hostel stay ever..was very impressed, excellent location close to everything.  hermosa beach is awesome ! "
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place suited me beautifully  i&amp;#39;ll be back
England,Female,25-30,8,6,6,10,8,10,10,6,"great hostel perfect for a few lazy days on the beach. the staff were fantastic and it was the friendliest hostel i&amp;#39;ve stayed in. about 45-60minutes away from the hustle and bustle of hollywood we ubered it. the room was cozy, 6 females in an ensuite which was so dirty i preferred showering in the communal showers down the corridor which are clean and fine. the hostel is cleaned daily but perhaps could do with a bit of tlc. as a traveler i&amp;#39;d go back. "
England,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"a great place to stay, with bars and restaurants right next to it, and right next to the beach. i rented a bike from them easily, and joined in their bar crawl as soon as i arrived. very friendly. difficult to find but secure front door and rooms doors. the lockers need a small padlock, rather than a large one that i had. definitely recommend"
Germany,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,i was traveling by my own and this hostel was an awesome place to meet nice people and spend a great time.
Australia,Female,25-30,6,8,10,4,2,10,6,2,"this is the first hostel i've ever stayed at. it was good for the cheap price. you get a bed, shower facilities, which is pretty much all you need. the shower wasn't great. it was dirty, however, that's just from previous people's use. the lock on the dorm rooms were secure. i only spent 1 night, so did not get involved socially much. hermosa beach is 45 min from santa monica pier, so it's not very central for me."
Slovakia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i very enjoyed my stay at the surf city hostel.the best.  jozsef from slovakia.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved my stay! perfect position, and everybody is so kind and helpful :)   can&amp;#39;t wait to return in a few weeks!"
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is awesome! the location couldn&amp;#39;t be better - located right on hermosa beach pier with many restaurants, banks and bars. i felt very safe in the area and at the hostel! the restrooms are very clean and feel like you are staying in someone&amp;#39;s home (in a good way. would recommend this to anyone coming to la and wants to stay closer to the airport, near the beach or see a little more than the super touristy hollywood area. "
SouthAfrica,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"friendly staff and awesome atmosphere   clean   great value for money  good location, right on the beach above a strip of bars"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,10,8,"it is a very cute little hostel right at the pier. although the entrance was a little hard to find at the beginning, the rooms were standard and the location was just perfect, right on the beach, very convenient! if i will ever be in this part of la, i will definitely go there again!"
NewZealand,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"i was very happy to have chosen this hostel. it&amp;#39;s right on the beach, and a busy, cheerful, bar street down from hermosa beach pier.    perhaps a bit far south if you mainly want to visit hollywood, but ideal for a beach holiday.    also great was the management. the owner treats her guests as her family, warm and cheerful. great breakfasts: apples, bananas, cereals, toast, spreads, coffee, and more on occasion.    common space is a little divided, but ample really. recommended."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the best locations you&amp;#39;ll find for a hostel in la. steps to the beach, great food and bars literally right beside the hostel. staff is awesome, the hostel is run very well. i&amp;#39;d definitely come back next time i&amp;#39;m in la!"
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,really fun atmosphere. the staff were incredibly helpful and fun.   can&amp;#39;t beat the location and the night life! would definitely recommend. 
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"yes, it&amp;#39;s loud outside but you know it&amp;#39;s going to be that way because it&amp;#39;s located near shops, bars and restaurants. but the walk to the pier is short and the facilities are great. i encountered a problem with a guest in the room i was assigned, i think she didn&amp;#39;t want to share a room with a certain ethnicity (mine). she was rude and somewhat hostile towards me and the staff. the staff handled it well and assured me that everything was going to be alright. she left, i stayed. all good. "
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,6,8,"descent hostel, nice location. far away from club scene. free parking three blocks away"
Wales,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,8,4,6,2,4,"the location was lovely with the beach and  restaurants, but the  instructions to get to the hostel on the website are not easy to follow after 4hours of trying to get to the hostel i had to get an uber. the wifi didn&amp;#39;t work in most rooms, and the showers were at time dirty or cold.   the blankets were never changed from guest to guest. no organised day trips or activitys. the kitchen was really small and not clean, only 1 computer. over all this hostel needs work! "
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"this place is in the best location you can get. the room i was in had on ocean view and the hostel is located right next to all of the popular restaurants and shops in hermosa beach. the free parking is limited but i didn&amp;#39;t have any trouble finding a spot. friendly staff, great location, and overall would highly recommend."

Turkey,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,the location is perfect! staff is very friendly and helpful. i would stay again at surf city hostel.
Poland,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,"overall a nice hostel, very close to the beach. it's very far from all the other places in la though.... (you would need to take a cab or rent a car, if you want to go anywhere, it takes ages, if you take the bus)."
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"location is amazing--it&amp;#39;s about as close to the actual beach as you can possibly get. i arrived during a holiday weekend festival, so finding parking was the only issue i encountered. hostel staff were great, the room and bath were very clean, and as a lone female traveler i felt very safe. highly recommend."
Colombia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"overall a very nice place to stay, just be mindful of the noise. thanks to the staff for being so helpful!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had such a fantastic time here! the staff were really friendly and laid back and the hostel was full of fun and interesting people of all ages. the bathroom was small but clean and was only accessible by the people in my all-female dorm. there were no silly rules like some hostels have and i will definitely be returning when i come back to la!
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff were amazing, location perfect! thanks for the stay guys!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,location was great an people were friendly - you would not want to be a light sleeper though as the room was very noisy from the nightlife downstairs. hermosa beach is a really cool area to hang out - would definitely recommend it. 
USA,Female,31-40,8.3,10,8,10,6,10,8,6,"ssh is in an unbeatable location! the facilities are slowly being upgraded, but there are currently few bathrooms, and they could use a facelift. they just finished installing one very nice bathroom with several stalls for toilets and showers when i&amp;#39;d gotten there. the price is unbeatable, the staff was awesome, and the other guests were super cool too. "
Russia,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,"overall pretty good value for money. pluses: good location, nice staff always willing to help, friendly atmosphere, free wi-fi, breakfast, kitchen to cook. minuses: no parking, lack of privacy (understandably though, it&amp;#39;s a hostel!), may be noisy at night because of the nearby pubs and restaurants. on the whole, better than i expected. thank you! "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic host who goes the extra mile to make you happy. really good location away from scummy hollywood. right near the beach. 
USA,Male,31-40,8,4,8,10,8,10,10,6,i enjoyed the location and people the most. i must say the staff were friendly and accomodating. thank you! i&amp;#39;ll be back to stay next time.
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,10,6,very nice hostel located right on the beach. the staff was very nice and there were so many cool travelers from all over. very nice and i would stay there again. 
USA,Female,41+,8.9,10,6,10,8,10,10,8,the reason i gave security a middle face is because i don&amp;#39;t believe propping the outer doors open is safe.  i believe the gathering areas could be reconfigured for more comfort.
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"would absolutely recommend this place.. the staff alone makes it worth it to stay here. it was one of the most welcoming hostels i&amp;#39;ve been to, and the location is amazing. "
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"was a great place to stay - hard to find initially, but was a block away from the beach.  great location, very friendly and helpful staff.  there was free parking about a half mile away, short cab ride from downtown.  overall, great value!"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing staff. really friendly. right next to the beach. great beach views from the windows. good kitchen to cook in after a decent, substantial free breakfast "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"best location ever!!! especially for that price. rooms were very clean and it was nice to leave the window open and hear the ocean. everyone i met was super friendly, including the staff. don&amp;#39;t forget to bring your passport! enjoy!"
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,the manager is a very sweet french woman who treats all of her guests like family.  she made the place very nice!
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,great location especially since it is right on the pier. everyone was friendly.

Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"stayed one night with my mum. super friendly and welcoming staff, also very helpful. great location, absolutely beautiful, such a cute little beachside area away from the busy city, but not too far away from it at the same time. hostel is right on the beach and next to shops and restaurants. good facilities, room was clean, beds comfy, bathroom small but functional. free breakfast simple (toast and cereal, coffee, tea) but good. would definitely stay here again, hopefully for longer next time!"
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,6,10,4,8,"pros: great location right next to beach in calm but fun town of hermosa beach, excellent staff, clean, cheap bikes for rent    cons: the front door is always wide open and the main desk is in the back of the hostel so there is not really any ""security"" (although everyone is given a personal room key), far from downtown and hollywood--have to take multiple buses and it takes at least an hour, the kitchen and living room are both very small, majority of hostel guests seem to be older"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent location.
Singapore,Couple,18-24,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,"hostel staff were friendly and helpfu! clean sheets and towels were provided, free breakfast was also a plus! right next to the beach and not too touristy. only bad thingt would be that there was a huge  cockcroach in our room on the 2nd day of our stay. not sure if it came from the hostel or outside of the hostel. overall, a pleasant and fuss free stay."
Moldova,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"excellent location, staff is friendly, really good deal. will certainly come back if i decide to stay in beach cities ever again in la."

Austria,Couple,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,10,8,8,"the location of the hostel is amazing, just one block from the beach an you can see the ocean from your room. the staff was superfriendly and helped us with all our questions. the wifi connection is not that good in the rooms up in the 2nd floor. but there is a lot of common space downstairs where it works properly. moreover they serve really good breakfast! we definitly would stay there again."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,8,4,6,8,6,"the hostel is really small so i generally like the atmosphere better than in big hostels. however, from my point of view there were too many people in one room - i never felt so claustrophobic before in a hostel (i stored most of my stuff in my car during the time we stayed there). moreover, i think there are too less showers and bathrooms for that amount of people."
France,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"it was a very good experience. i leave not so far away from it but i booked a room for me and a friend and the staff was wonderful. the other customers are very nice and friendly. the location is more than excellent. you are surrounded by bars, restaurant and have the hermosa beach pier in front of you. the beach is 50m away.   it is the place to be."

Germany,Female,18-24,5.1,6,6,8,6,2,2,6,the staff was unfriendly and it didn't seem that he wanted to do his job. during check-in i have asked him two times where i may park but he didn't tell me as i asked again he said i shall bring my luggage to the room and come back again afterwards. as i returned he wasn't in the office anymore. another guest asked if she can help me somehow and she explained me the way to the parking.
England,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"right on the beach front was tricky to find the little door to begin with, but the staff was amazing help such a calm atmosphere the dorms are basic, but the common room and kitchen could do with updating, you get what you pay for ...all in all a great 4 nights "
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,8,4,8,6,8,8,4,"overall it was an enjoyable stay with a quirky bunch of backpackers. this hostel however is definitely not for most people, with security and administration being very relaxed. no proper social events were organized while i was here, but the small social room helped with the atmosphere."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,absolutely amazing hostel. only stayed for four nights and made so many friends. a place to both relax and party and the most amazing location!

Taiwan,Female,18-24,4.3,4,2,6,4,6,4,4,it is not safe to live there cuz their office close in the evening . i
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"we enjoyed our stay at the hostel - the staff was friendly and the location excellent.  one important thing to consider is where your room is located within the building.  there is a bar beneath the hostel and while we were there, live music was being played.  additionally, there is quite a bit of noise coming from the walkway as it's a popular location.  all in all, we enjoyed the stay.  just be mindful of your room location and i would suggest, bring ear plugs."
Canada,Male,25-30,8,10,6,10,6,10,8,6,my second stay at this hostel. great experience both trips. awesome place to stay when you have a flight the next day. close enough to the airport that you don't need to leave 3 hours early. location is unreal. i have stayed previously between conferences and this has to be one of the best locations i have seen for a hostel. been to many in south america and europe and the value for this hostel is up there with the best of them. only thing that would make it better is a/c.
England,Female,18-24,7.4,8,4,10,8,8,8,6,we had an amazing time at surf city - thank you very much!!! x
France,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"the perfect place to be in l.a. and one of the best hostel have stayed.  people are really friendly, the view on the beach is amazing. the district, hermosa beach is safe and there is many pub and cafés around to get a good evening /night moment. i've really enjoyed my stay in this place. and i will come back for sure."

Belgium,Female,25-30,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,i booked and paid for two nights but only stayed for one. i lived in africa for 8 years but never felt as unsafe as at surf city. no security despite dodgy area. rude and aggressive french manager.

Canada,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"unbeatable location. staff from lots of different nationalities. do not go there if you intend to have good sleep, this is a party place. there's several bars and clubs around and the liquor store 30 secs away closes at 2:00 am. overall this is a pleasant place to be."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,6,8,6,"it took them two days to fix the bathroom light and some of our belongings went missing, overall a pretty good hostel though! basic but in a great location."
England,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,wonderful place to start off my us adventure! hostel is perfectly fine and staff friendly and always ready to assist. it's located right on the beach! i was lucky enough to arrive just before labor day and the festivities over the weekend were absolutely fantastic!! it can be rather loud at night because of its location and busy atmosphere but if your looking to have a good time i'd highly recommend this place. but if your looking for a quiet place to relax then maybe surf city isn't for you. 
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"the lockers on site were only big enough for a pairs of shoes. a/c in the sleeping quarters would be greatly appreciated as it was hot at night. ambient noise from the restaurants &amp; bars below was loud also. couldn't be closer to the beach if you tried, scenery was beautiful and picturesque."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,had an amazing time here. the atmosphere was great and staff helped accommodate me when there was no room available. i would come back in a heartbeat. thank you for the best 4 nights of my trip!!

Ireland,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay here, a lovely place to finish my holiday. helpful and friendly staff."
Spain,Female,25-30,5.1,4,4,8,4,6,4,6,"lots of teenagers, yelling in the corridor until 2am both nights that we stayed there, sitting at our bedroom door even if there was actually plenty common places to be used instead. quite disrespectful...the hostel workers should not allow that. maybe the fact that they were teens as well did not help. the ""free parking"" was actually a normal street 10min by walk from the hostel, where anyone could park."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,10,10,8,8,"brilliant staff, the manager does a great job of looking after her guests!"
Italy,Female,31-40,4.9,4,4,8,4,6,4,4,"the hostel was less popular 1 y ago, less expensive, i enjoyed stay here, almost all the people i met have been great! this year was different, some people were nice but those in my dorm not at all, really confused about having fun.having fun doesn't mean be racist, try to steal money from my purse, open my luggage in my absence, left dirty underware on it, open the curtains when i am still naked dressing myself, talk rabbish on people's back,making noise from 5 am and stay always in the room!!"
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,close to the beach which was nice however the hostel and area was very noisy at night.
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,10,8,6,6,10,8,this place became home for us very quickly. i would of liked more advice as to what we should see while in la. some people use it as a place to stay but we are travelling and want to see every thing and we couldn't even get accurate advice on how to use the bus service
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"so i didn't put excellent on everything for this hostel because i was being fairly harsh and comparing it to what it could be, but considering that what i did describe as excellent was very well deserved. the location and value for what you pay could not be better. i wish i could upload a picture from my phone i took out of my window. it was absolutely gorgeous and don't bother with the whole band being too loud thing."
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"it&amp;#39;s a located in a very nice area, facilities are average.  a little on the expensive side."
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the location is absolutely ideal - just a few steps away from a lively, beautiful beach and in the center of dozens and dozens of restaurants and bars. people are very friendly and there is always something to do."
Germany,Male,41+,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,"the hostel is located at the beach directly under a pub. it's a good location to make party. lots of bars and restaurants are near the hostel. with this advantage, it could be loud until after 12:00 am. staffs are very friendly. the hostel is ideal for people who do surfing or swimming."
Switzerland,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,"awesome location, guaranteed to meet lots of nice people"
France,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,10,6,"the spot si amazing, very nice staff, a lot of places to eat and have a drink around. mostly young people from all around the world are staying there which makes it a really cool place to stay! i recommend it!!"
Spain,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"everything was pretty good. great breakfast, unbeatable location (it was an amazing area to stay after visiting the city during the day; i also loved the beach there and it's not as crowded as other beaches in la) and very nice personnel. some things would be good to renew (like mattresses; mine was pretty uncomfortable to sleep on), but overall the hostel was pretty decent and i had an amazing experience. i would totally recommend it!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,awesome location and great atmosphere
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"right on the beach you couldn't get a better location!  still close enough to day trip into la if you wish but there is more than enough to do here in terms of beaches, food, drinks and coastal touring to keep you busy.  a very friendly and social hostel with fantastic staff.  there's always a bit of a party going and it's very easy to meet people and have a good time."
Germany,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"hi there,    thank you for hosting me - i had a really good start for my trip and received very helpfull recommendation from francis.    best regards  tanja"
Canada,Male,18-24,3.1,2,4,8,2,2,2,2,"i have never stayed in a hostel this overpriced. it should be a maximum a 15$/night. there is no ac, the shades in our room were falling apart. at one point, there was a cockroach in the hallway so we chased it down to kill it so it wouldn't get into our room. the man at the reception came by to see what we were doing and just said ""leave it alone"". i don't mind cheap hostels, but they have to be inexpensive to be worth the adventure. this hostel had nothing going for it."
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,10,6,"location could not be any better for a good time - right next to a strip of bars/restaurants. front/back door was sometimes left open, so security could be a little better. rooms were extremely hot, as no aircon, showers got a bit sandy so could have done with a quick wash every now and then, but other than that, i couldn't recommend this hostel any more! place to be! "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent staff, beautiful views."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"loved this hostel! we booked for 4 nights and ended up staying for 9! located right by the beach, we could see the beach from our bedroom window. as the hostel isn't huge everyone gets to know one another. met some great people, everyone really friendly. will 100% come back and stay here again next time i am in la. could not fault this hostel, great value for money. "
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,good hostel right on hermosa beach. breakfast basic but quality. internet available throughout. can be at bars/beach/restaurants/bike and board rental places in seconds!! couldn't get my key deposit back unfortunately because they closed reception early the night before i was leaving :( price seemed best in the city; don't expect european/south american hostel prices in la!! will stay here again if i'm in the area!
England,Female,31-40,4,4,4,8,2,4,4,2,"stairs lead to the hostel, difficult if you have suitcase to carry it alone upstairs, and then lob it through a hallway at the end to the reception. no security, doors left wide open, anybody can access the hostel.  dirty, filthy rooms, overcrowded and small with 3 bunkbeds in room 107, no air con and the room gets really hot, and the street noise is unbelievably loud from the pub downstairs which plays loud music and revellers walking the streets, couldn't sleep at all.  dirty bed covers"
Armenia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love staying at surf city hostel whenever i come to town. it's so close to the beach you can see the ocean from every window. the staff is friendly and the place is clean and easygoing. it's a very warm and inviting place. there are so many restaurants and shops nearby that it really is the best place to stay in the area. it's not to far to walk to redondo beach. i love surf city hostel.
USA,Male,18-24,6.3,10,2,10,8,4,8,2,first time traveller that's 19 years old. this place is nothing more than a place to chill your feet at night. staff needs to be more serious about their job and clean the damn place. still would probably go back due to being so close to the beach and have a nice view. make it more traveller friendly and then this place would be golden!
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had an excellent time at the surf city hostel; it was my first time visiting hermosa beach. the staff were very helpful and friendly.  great location; my room had a view of the beach. i would definitely stay here again! it can be loud at night from the surrounding bars but ear plugs did the trick. the price you pay to stay right in the heart of hermosa!
Denmark,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,8,4,6,6,6,10,6,"the manager seriously needs to change his bad attitude. the other staff was sweet, welcoming and funny. we were many who thought he was arrogant and uncomfortable. otherwise it was a good hostel. too bad the managers energy was so negative... "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,8,8,10,10,"great hostel! location fantastic! located on a plaza with great shops and right on the beach. i had so much fun meeting people that i didn't want to leave! there was some items stolen during my stay (not mine), and some concerns about homeless wandering in, but i never personally felt insecure as the area was super safe, it's a reminder that with all places, you should be keeping your gear under lock and key. thanks!"
Wales,Male,25-30,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,8,6,i would highly recommend surf city hostel. location was great and staff were also great. great hostel vibe

England,Couple,18-24,5.1,4,8,8,4,6,4,2,cockroaches in the kitchen and bathroom! it's a shame as it's a great little place to stay and you are right on hermosa beach. need some tlc!
Canada,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,10,6,8,"great hostel! clean and secure, lots of amenities. the sound of waves in the morning worth the few screams coming from bars around.  definitly would recommend this hostel."

Jordan,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,10,6,the staff are very friendly especially odre(the french woman) and iraqi (mohamad)  the location is great. hermosa beach is the best. they have bolikes to rent which was awesome. it's great choice to meet people around the world.
France,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,it's the perfect hostel for backpakers
USA,Male,41+,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i enjoyed my stay, it met my needs. the owner was very nice."
Finland,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"hermosa beach has a special, easy-going atmosphere and surf city hostel is just like that. the location right by the beach and next to pubs is excellent. easy to rent a surf board and start practicing, or play beach volley with new friends... the breakfast is great with so many sorts of food. definitely would recommend."
Argentina,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"awesome staff and friendly people. plus it's really close to the beach! the neighbourhood it's probably the best of la, better than venice beach and manattan beach too. can't decide if it's better that santa monica but it's defined a place that i would recommend to everyone."
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great people, great staff, great location, great breakfast. i had so much fun at this hostel. will definitely come back somewhen"
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"* location is great - close to many restaurants, bars etc  * bus connection to downtown la is slow (1,5 h)  * some people i met had to pay 10$ per bike and some 15$ thats a bit annoying"
Canada,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,6,6,4,"no wifi in the dormitories, only in the common rooms. hair all over the bathroom. soggy towel left on bathroom floor for days. garbage never changed. room very very humid and smell of mold, which penetrated all my clothes."
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,fun and clean hostel. lots of bars to go to in the evening and great tacos next door. plenty of bikes to rent! recommend riding to venice. not a party hostel but can be loud with club below. room pics don't really match pics on the site otherwise rooms are clean and staff is great!!
France,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed a few days in surf city hostel at the very end of a long trip. it s a very nice, relaxing (but lots of party also if you want to) place. 30 secondes to the beach (hermosa beach is very clean and huge), staff is always helpful, free breakfast very big. it's not a huge hostel, which allows to meet people easily in the common area. a perfect stay, thanks."
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"literally had the best time here, everyone was so nice and the location is amazing if you want some time on the beach and chilled out vibe with some great bars at night. it's too far out if you wish to go to hollywood etc but great people there will mean you never want to leave!"
England,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,6,10,was in la on business and decided to stay at the beach for the weekend prior. a great little spot with fantastic views and right in the heart of a great night out. can't recommend this place highly enough and i will definitely stay again next time i'm in la.
Bangladesh,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"perhaps the best location in la, right on the beach, atmosphere is great, staffs are very friendly and helpful, decent rooms and clean toilets, all the pubs and night life are just right at the door, good breakfast. the only problem is the noises from outside pubs in the evening, that's understandable because of the location but they should not allow the guests to make noisy parties in the common areas during late nights! still it's a great place and with some nice people."
Canada,Female,31-40,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"i stayed at surf city hostel during an overnight layover on my way home from overseas. upon arriving to the hostel after  30-some hour flight, the hostel staff greeted me with a smile and a friendly chat as i checked in. she was kind enough to help me arrange my transportation to lax for the following morning so i wouldn't have to be stressed about it at 4am when i had to be at the airport! at first i was bummed to have an overnight layover but now i can't wait to go back! for longer this time!"
Sweden,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,a clear 100% if not for the club underneath. shakes the whole place up but only until midnight. amazing free breakfast and i got all the help for my special needs at the time. no reason for me to stay anywhere else.
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,we had the best time at surf city hostel. super cheap bike/surf hire. next to all the local bars. i would recommend going to the spot a vegetarian restaurant - amazing food!!! yes it's loud until 2 am but don't be boring go and get drunk then you won't even notice!

USA,Male,18-24,8,6,8,6,6,10,10,10,its kinda far from a lot of things... but overall was good. had the chance to leave from the hostel and in 1 min i was able to see the sun fall from the beach!
Germany,Male,18-24,8,10,8,10,6,8,8,6,nice located!   wide beds
Poland,Female,25-30,7.7,10,8,8,8,8,4,8,"located right by the beach, perfect for surfing. no communal area, there is a tv room but too small to socialise, hence no atmosphere, you are either in your room or on the beach. not recommended for solo travellers. if you thinking of traveling to downtown or hollywood from there it takes about 2-3 hours to get there. clean rooms, free breakfast, friendly staff"
USA,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,10,8,6,"nice little hostel right on the beach. price is a bit high for the facilities, but i guess the beach pays for itself. kind of old building. loud during night and early morning. bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. staff were rad! "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent staff, very clean facilities. met some great people during my stay. the location cant get any better. i could see the beach and the ocean from my bunk bed. will return!"

Ireland,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,great hostel right on hermosa beach. only a 30 minute bus ride from lax airport. rented a bike and cycled 20km along a safe bike trail along the coast to venice beach and santa monica. very far from downtown hollywood and other tourist attractions. staff were helpful and friendly. easy to meet other travellers. 
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,thank you beautiful people of surf city hostel - for a very pleasent stay!   what makes a good stay at a hostel is mainly the people you get to know and a clean surrounding - this is what we had. it can get a little loud in this area though - so just be prepared for a little party here´n there :)  danke francis für die hundert fragen die du steht´s bereit warst zu beantworten! :)  we apreciated this a lot!!!  ♥⚓♥

USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was by far the best experience at a hostel i've had. truly outstanding. it is the staff that really made the trip. nick, in particular, was absolutely dedicated to keeping everything together while also promoting a good time with all. through his efforts, this was much more communal and social than i've seen lately.     of course the beautiful landscape and weather helped. 10/10. fantastic."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,nice staff. only stayed for a night though so not much more to add

Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"this hostel is one of the best i have been to. the owner is superfriendly and involved with the life in the hostel. the people are open, interested and enthusiastic. the location is amazing: just next to the beach. i really recommend to stay here, but be warned: you will probably extend your stay:)"
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,it was so noisy for the music stage by the side.
Canada,Female,31-40,6.9,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,we stayed at this hostel before our departure to australia.  while we were there we stayed in a 6rm dorm but we booked for a 4rm.  not sure what the difference in cost was because we forgot to go ask/tell the staff.  the room was decent.  it was the first hostel i had ever stayed in so i didn't know what to expect.  basically it was outdated but relatively clean.  the staff was very helpful with things to do in the area and it was close to shops/restaurants.
Canada,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"perfect location. right by the beach, nestled in between bars and restaurants. the staff were helpful and friendly. the crowd of guests tended to get rowdy (especially the aussies). overall good experience, despite not getting much sleep. make sure to check out the happy hours at nearby establishments."
Switzerland,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,6,8,10,8,10,"a very nice hostel! i had a good time there. the only thing is, if you wanna spend time in the city center or hollywood and you don't have a car, it's too fare away. but if you're looking for a hostel on the beach, that is the place to be!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,my stay there was so comfortable! i didn't wanna leave i was right by the beach and restaurants i liked my visit. i would recommend this hostel for anyone who's looking to save some money! welcome to california :-)

Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,10,6,4,8,6,excellent location this hostel has potential but its way to loud above all the bars at night unless you want to go out every single night mon to sun. not the cleanest. i accidently locked myself out of a private room the morning i had to get to the airport only 1of 3 staff seemed to give a care about helping me. need an emergency number for when office is closed. almost missed my flight as had to wait until 8am for spare key from owner 
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"parking spot quite far (but that' because of the location)  mattress very thin, not comfortable"
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,8,10,8,best place ever.  definitely going back.
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"beautiful location, literally ten seconds walk to the beach. very cute and cozy neighborhood of hermosa, felt just at home."
Chile,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"thank, my stay was very good. i will recommed surf city hostel."
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,you cannot beat the beach location for the price!
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,10,8,8,8,"right next to hermosa beach and a load of bars! close to some cool shops! the place is clean and tidy! works for me! i hired a bike from the hostel for $25 or so and went to santa monica, that's a good trip! rocking!"
Macedonia,Male,18-24,5.7,6,8,10,6,4,4,2,"well i really not expected this. i can not said that i'm not satisfied but also i really was surprised. i have been in a thousand other hostels around us and the feeling was more in a hotel than hostel but this was small, not very clean they put u in a room with people who live and work in the hostel. i mean i'm guest put me with the other guests not with people who are smoke and live there and their stuff. in general average goes to poor."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,this hostel was awesome!! i was traveling by myself and thought i would get bored during my stay at hermosa beach. no!  the beach is a one minute walk away from the hostel the people there are super friendly and helpful.   the price to stay there is absolutely fair!  there are a lot of places around where you can find food and breakfast at ther hostel was also okay :)   next time i go there i definitly will stay at surf city ;)
Austria,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,10,6,"i loved this hostel, it was the first stop of a long trip and i was really tired when i arrived. but the atmosphere and the people were so great that i went out and ended up having a blast. it's right on the beach, location could not be better! and the breakfast was amazing, never had such a rich and good breakfast at a hostel before."
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,6,10,10,6,so much fun :)
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,amazing location but very noisy both inside and outside the hostel.  it is almost on a gorgeous beach with bars and restaurants literally on the door step.  if you want to laze on the beach in the day and party all night this is the place but if you want a decent nights sleep try somewhere else! the wifi was only in certain areas but then worked well.  the kitchen and communal areas were fine but small.  
USA,Female,41+,6.6,8,4,10,4,8,8,4,"don't expect much in the way of creature comforts here, but the prime location more than makes up for it."
China,MixedGroup,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"i booked two beds there, but after we arrived there we found it's located in between bars and it's very noisy and full of people in the passage way when we arrived there at 11 pm.  the guy at the counter said it's fine to just not stay but i need to pay for the deposit, i thought it's fine because i can get the most part of the money back. and we leaved and found another place to stay.  after few days, i found i was charged full price and i called their manager, she said i have to pay in full!"
Italy,Male,18-24,8,6,6,10,8,8,10,8,"this hostel is really well located, right in the middle of the hustle on pier avenue. for that reason though it is hard to sleep before 3 am, especially if your bedroom faces the bars. if you are on the first floor, forget about it since there is a bar downstairs with music going on until 2 am. the atmosphere is great though, very friendly people and staff, right in front of the beach. good place to party if you are alone. if you are traveling with more people, you can get a hotel for the same $"
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,10,4,the hostel was located really good. took an hour bike ride to venice beach 
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,8,8,"we are biking the pacific coast highway/ highway 1, and this was the first stop for us from landing in lax. just a short shuttle from lax, and with surf city being 'right on the beach' meant we could stick our toes in the second we arrived, as late as it was! staff was super nice, knowledgeable, flexible, and they have a locked security closet where we could keep our larger valuables. though, bring earplugs-- it is still a hostel over a bar and right on the pier lined with delicious food shops!"
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,we had a great time at surf city! we could hear and see the beach from our window- this is probably the best located hostel in terms of proximity to the beach.  the guests were from all over and we really enjoyed meeting some new international friends. the accommodations are basic but clean and the staff were very friendly.  we also rented bikes from the hostel for $5 each! such a deal!
Italy,Male,31-40,8.3,6,8,10,6,10,10,8,"right place for those who wants to spend days and nights at the open air (more or les...) and just need a place to stay and sleep.  rooms are slmple but clean and sure  15 minutes from lax, perfect stop for travellers.."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,this hostel is amazing! the location is perfect and everybody is really friendly 
Sweden,Female,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,10,8,easy to meet nice people :)
Canada,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,the hostel is located right on the beach and next to bars and shops. this is that second time i have stayed at the hostel and i would definitely go back again. the staff are helpful and friendly.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,10,6,8,8,10,8,a great hostel in a good location in the context of its surroundings. it's a long journey to get to the city by public transport though. 
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel unfortune the noise from the bars downstairs, couldn't sleep till 3am :("
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,staying for a few weeks.  been 4 days and it's super awesome.
England,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,10,6,stay here every year for an annual event and the staff always look after us. perfect location (unless you want to sleep!!)
USA,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,an awesome location!!! a bit of a frat atmosphere. but the location to the beach and bike path cannot be beat. i would stay here again. jerry frye indiana
England,Female,18-24,6.9,8,4,10,4,8,8,6,"the location of this hostel makes up for everything else. it is literally right on the beach. we had booked a 6 bed female room and ended up in a 4 bed mixed dorm. not only that, we awoke on our second morning to find a 5th person asleep on our (very tiny) room floor as the staff had nowhere else to put them. the wifi didn't work in the room and the power outlets hardly worked. the staff were friendly and helpful however and the atmosphere in the communal areas was fun. "
USA,Couple,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,8,6,"it's right on the beach!!  one of the cheapest places to stay in the south bay.  hermosa beach is very safe at night.  of course, it can be a bit noisy on the weekends.  you'll also really need a car if you're staying here and want to see la.  if you just want to surf and enjoy the sun, then maybe you wouldn't need one.  i definitely reccomend this hostel.  i can easily imagine staying here again."
Australia,Male,18-24,8,10,6,10,8,8,8,6,"hostel was in a great location (right by the beach), it was a little hard to find it at first though because the entrance is kind of hidden. the general security is low - anyone can walk up the stairs. there was sand on my mattress, but it's a beach town so i guess that's expected. other than that it's a great hostel and i'd probably stay there again."
Sweden,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,very nice hostel. i felt at home here. very easy to meet friendly people :)
Norway,Male,31-40,5.1,2,2,10,4,6,6,6,"location couldn't be better, for beach or night time party.okay to stay, if don't own any thing of value. what ever expensive name brand clothes or accessories. 3 lockers pr room which there are six guests, luggage room open  some times (people could grab what ever they want).  front door open. and no self locking door to your room, so the rooms are open usually, when other guest don't lock.  book the hole room if some one want to stay here."
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location and clean was a great stay and includes breakfast! 
Italy,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,10,4,6,4,6,great position. the atmosphere is kind of weird.
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,6,10,10,10,8,8,"great place, great price, great location. no complaints!!"
Brazil,Male,41+,7.1,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,the only hostel downside was the inaccurate parking information at the website. the hostel doesn't have any parking area available. you have to park your car at public parking areas which are far away and have day and time restrictions.   this information must be updated at the website so no future guest can be disapointed.
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,awesome place to stay when in la. great atmosphere. right off the beach. cheap bike rental. definitely will be back. 
Spain,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,great hostel! good atmosphere and nice location in front of hermosa beach. the only problem is that hollywood is too far away if you are using public transportation...
Netherlands,Female,31-40,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,6,6,i liked the location and the staff was akso very nice. i liked it that you could rent a bike for only 10 dollars. when i was there the atmosphere was soso. maybe it had to due with that i was there on a monday and tuesday.
England,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,6,8,8,10,6,lovely hostel in the lovely hermosa beach. everyone's very chilled and friendly and there's art all over the walls. our room had an ensuite but it wasn't cleaned very often but it was still ok. the free breakfast and cheap bike hire were definately bonus's cycled to venice beach and santa monica but is 15miles each way so would recommend getting up early so as to be back before sunset. takes about 2hours on public transport to hollywood.
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,i traveled with a friend of mine for a weekend get away. we loved the location right in the middle of everything and our room overlooked the beach! the staff was very friendly. the area is a little noisy on the weekend but the price you pay for being walking distance to everything. we shared a room with 4 other travelers from germany and russia and loved getting to know all the many different worldly travelers that were passing through. this hostel and the people we met definitely made our trip!
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"i couldn't imagine a ""better"" place to experience the california beach life and positive vibes than at the surf city hostel in hermosa beach. perfect location and staff! odile the manager and fab her assistant are very caring and hard-working people who are there to assist travelers in every way they can! the hostel could use some updating and a few of the rooms can be noisy, but beyond that this is a top-notch place in a top-notch location with cool guests and a staff that cares! cheers! joe"
Italy,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,really good breakfast and a vibe atmosphere that needed to be lived!
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,"there are many long term resident there which made it feel more like a homeless shelter more than a hostel.   it's in a great spot if you are in cali for the beach.  breakfast was cool and wifi was also pretty good.  definately not a party hostel and not that great if you are looking to meet people. it's also very far from the clubs.  more long termers than actual travellers = bad/ depressing vibe, so keep that in mind..."
England,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"nice hostel, great location. can be very noisy on friday/saturday nights from the bar below - remember ear plugs"
Canada,Male,25-30,5.7,4,6,6,4,8,6,6,"this is well located if you like having time on the beach or like surfing. but consider about one hour and half or more of public transport to get to downtown and hollywood. warning : there is a bar just downstair blasting the music with a huge amount of bass, the walls, windows and bed bunks were shaking. if you are looking for a quiet place near the beach dont go there, or ask for a room at the third floor(their second)."
Germany,Male,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"playing the pro beach tennis tourney, it was a perfect location for me to get ready for the tourney on hermosa beach.  coming from kauai, its a very similar feel with a bit more affluence.  i highly recommend it.    mark keil  poipu beach, hi"
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"i had very limited funds and needed somewhere to stay for a few days.  this was a great place.  super friendly people and right on the beach.  the common rooms are small, but kept tidy and the kitchen seemed well stocked with pots and pans and such. (i didn't use the kitchen because there are so many awesome restaurants just out the door.)  the rooms were clean enough and i loved that the room i was in had a bathroom attached.  staff was friendly and helpful. great deal for the money!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,6,10,8,10,10,10,"there were only two little issues with this hostel. there is nowhere to lock up your luggage-only small things like laptops and cell phones. also, the internet only works well in the computer room. other than that, this hostel was great! i'll definitely return next time i come to l.a."
Russia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place! thank you guys!
Germany,Female,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,free breakfast
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,was sick bahhh check it out wooo spergn beck
USA,Female,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,i enjoyed my stay at the surf city hostel.  i was in 6 bed women's dorm on the 2nd floor with a private bathroom.  my bed had a view of the ocean and the other ladies were considerate and friendly.  the location is great - steps from the beach and near restaurants and bars.  my suggestion is to bring your own small padlock for the lockers.  this allows you the peace of mind to lock your valuables and relax.  i rented a hostel bike during my stay and loved biking to the surrounding beaches.
England,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"very chilled hostel, you get what you pay for. great location and helpful staff. mattress on my bed definitely needed replacing though. kind of an awkward location to get to but it's definitely worth it, hermosa beach is beautiful"
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,top place with top people. more the real la and not to touristy
Japan,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,they are really friendlly. i want to stay there again.
Germany,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"it was a very nice hostel with very nice people. the staff with the red cap was really funny and taked  care that we get safe to the greyhound station. (btw, u can catch the bus 60 (i think it was)  from the end of ur train way, it takes u 1 block further the greyhound station)"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,8,8,seriously helpful and friendly staff! pretty happy with the included breakfast as well.
Australia,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"this was my second time staying at this hostel. its location is amazing, beach views from some windows. right in amongst the bars and resturants that line this lively strip. the owner is fabulous and is really welcoming. facilities are adiquate. if your looking for a place a few steps from the beach, and being in amongst cool bars and resturants, this place cant be beat. if you want to grab an early night you will need noise cancelling headphones as the bars and clubs obviously radiate noise."
Japan,Male,31-40,5.7,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,"i could find no better points than average, but it was expensive than expected.  i will try to find any other hostel next time."
England,Male,31-40,5.7,6,4,6,6,8,6,4,"this place is a bit shabby.     good points: nice staff. nice breakfast. good location for beach volleyball. rent bikes for cheap. very close to beach. big tv. wifi.    bad points: small tv room, kitchen and internet room. shower rooms not too good and mixed gender with inadequate stalls so high opportunity for perving behaviours(!) plastic sheeting on beds. hermosa is a bit boring. long term residents, some stoned a lot. blinds let in sun in early morning. no wifi in my room."
USA,Female,25-30,6,6,8,6,6,6,4,6,"this hostel is located near the beach, which is a plus!. parking is difficult here. i'm not one for clubs, bars, and loud music. there were too many drunk guest in this hostel. that's not my cup of tea. won't stay here again."
Slovenia,Female,41+,8,6,8,10,8,8,10,6,i loved the atmosphere at the hostel and the staff were just super kind.  the rooms and the sheets could be cleaner. the location is just perfect. despite the facts that many other hostels have nicer rooms and bathrooms i would come back to this one because of the staff and the general atmosphere in the hostel. i really enjoyed the stay.
Canada,Male,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"very welcoming, friendly owner! helpful staff! perfect location! i hope to visit again soon"
USA,Female,41+,8.3,10,6,8,8,10,10,6,"a good friendly place to stay., if you're into surfing or other beach sports. located on the  pier area a few hundred feet from the ocean. the location is in over a bar that stays open late on the weekends so getting to sleep early is difficult.   parking is a 15 minute walk away"
Switzerland,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,"the staff is super nice, the area is top! would be nicer i the hostel would have hostel events! but the rest is really good!"
Norway,Female,18-24,8.6,8,6,8,8,10,10,10,"very nice area. it's possible to rent bicycles at the hostel and if starting early it is a very nice day trip to cycle on the beach from hermosa to santa monica. there are some shops and restaurants in the area.  hermosa beach is a very nice place in la, but it takes 2-3 hours with the bus from hermosa beach to hollywood and 2 hours to downtown, so if you are in la to see all the tourist attractions, you should rent a car if you live there.  the busses stops running around 11pm."
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,10,6,8,8,10,10,6,first i was a little irritated that my roommates stay there for so long and that there things were kind of everywhere. but finally i realy enjoyed it there. it could be a little cleaner and i don´t know from witch kategorie i should take points for plastic matress covers.
USA,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"fun, clean, cheery.  what more can you ask for in a hostel on the beach?  nevertheless, the common ""living"" room had a bit of a moldy smell that they should probably have checked.  also note that this hostel is in a great location due to being on the beach, but it isn't a great location if you're planning on spending most of your time in downtown la as it's very far from downtown."
Russia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,no parking at all
Australia,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, fun nightlife"

England,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"the hostel itself was very basic and there is a bar underneath so be aware of that due to the noise!  however the area in which the hostel is located is really nice,  close to the beach and great bars and places to eat.  we were meant to be visiting down town la for the evening but after speaking to some friendly locals decided to stay in hermosa beach and i am glad we did!"

Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,6,10,8,"i had such a fun time here, made new friends, and it's in a beautiful location! but if you are taking transit (like i was), it is pretty far from all the other beaches and downtown. other than that, great place!"
USA,Male,41+,8.3,10,8,10,6,10,6,8,"great place.   little bit misrepresented on the web site, though. pics were taken when newly redecorated. well worn common space now... but they seem to be continually working on the place. new meaning for the word 'cozy' .  beds were excellent. pillow thin.  little noisy at night  for an old guy. (from the club entertainment down stairs)."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved this place!! really wish we'd stayed longer than 2 nights :(  prime location, hermosa beach is incredible and the staff were so welcoming and friendly plus you're always bound to find a party in the common room on a night :d:d"

Ireland,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,"amazing amazing amazing location!! basic hostel but just what we needed. communal showers and bathrooms which isn't ideal but location outweighs everything. also great free breakfast but get there about 10am if you want any of the toast or bagels, we went in at 11am one day and there was just cereal. nice stay overall "
USA,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,10,6,the location is unparalled. the staff is great. breakfast was a nice surpirse. i would go back anytime. stay away if you really don get what hostels are all about :-)

England,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"excellent location, staff are wonderful, hostel is very social and everyone is so friendly! good connections by bus into la city centre- slightly confusing but the staff were excellent help explaining it all and even printed off a map for us with directions.  couldn't be closer to the beach or any of the bars and restaurants in hermosa beach, which is great but this means the hostel is very loud at night as its right above a bar! im a heavy sleeper so it didnt bother me! i loved it here!"
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,5.1,4,6,2,4,8,8,4,"all in all i had a good first impression. simple rooms but fitting for the surfer style atmosphere.   hostel is located very close to the beach which is great... but it is also located above several bars with loud music playing until late night (2am and later). hostel is very lax about noise control.   great place to meet people, not so great if you need to sleep ;) "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was the experience of a lifetime.  no regrets at all.  thank you all for the fun!  i will be back!

Argentina,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i always stay here. i love it, i love it!!! staff is very nice &amp; the atmosphere is great, plus it's probably the best location on hermosa beach. it even beats those $200 per night hotels close by.   the lady that works there (forgot her name) is so nice and courteous. she’s always smiling &amp; trying her best to accommodate your needs.  i always recommend this place to my friends. we are coming back next year!  natali (from argentina)"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay were coming back
England,Couple,18-24,8.3,6,8,10,6,10,10,8,"very good hostel, price was more expensive than most hostels we have stayed in (our limit for a shared dorm was usually $25), however the location, staff and rooms were lovely. rented a bike for $10 for a day and cycled all along the coast to venice beach which was awesome (hence the perfect location).  only negative is that the kitchen closes at 9:30pm, which we felt was too early."
Colombia,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,i had a lot of fun in the hostel. the location is great. there are a lot of cool places nearby. the only problem is that there's a bar very close and sometimes is hard to sleep early at night.
Colombia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"the best part of the hostel is the location, very close to the beach and great fun places, but the room are very small and for a room of 6 beds is little unconfortable!    still great place!"
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,"a nice place very close to the beach! it's a bit tricky getting anywhere apart from the beach (roughly a 1 to 2 hour bus ride into la downtown not serviced by the train system). the staff were friendly and up for a laugh and helpful.   all the bedding was clean, bathrooms were cleaned regularly and kitchen kept very clean too.   the mattresses were a little thin but not bad. very loud and constant noise coming from outside (a generator i think). overall a good place to stay if you like the beach!"
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,8,6,the beds are rubbish! and lots of noise from the bar downstairs. other than that it's an alright hostel as it's right on the beach and there is lots of things to do around.
Denmark,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"hostelworld.com didn't mention anything about shared rooms, it said shared or single rooms, i was only offered a shared room. the hotel was literally placed on top of a nightclub, so the floor was bouncing and the music was so loud. the room was full of smoke. hostelworld.com didn't say anything about the bathroom facilities, but there was only 1 shared bathroom to every guest on the hotel. i couldn't stay there for only 1 day, i had to find another place to sleep. i would like to get a refund!"
USA,Male,41+,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,"overall, it was pleasant!"
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,6,6,10,8,8,8,8,the hostel is over a bar and thats why it's pretty loud at night til 3am.
DominicanRepublic,Female,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,it's a good value if you are traveling in a group of one or two. best day to use the laundry facilities is saturday night from 8-11pm. 
USA,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,fun place to stay and perfect location. i would go back! it's hard to beat $40 a night for an ocean view. love hermosa!
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,6,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed my stay here. the place is much bigger than i expected ao there were so many people to meet. it made for a really great stay. in addition, the staff was always helpful and even provided an amazing lunch on 4th of july. inly downside is the wifi strength is not super strong but that was not a big deal for me i just would go to the common rooms and use wifi in there. loved it here. will definitely be back."
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,6,10,6,10,8,10,"i really enjoyed my 2 night stay at the hostel. it was 4th of july week.  the staff was very friendly and helpful. the place was clean. i stayed in a 4-bed room and only had one roommate from london.great guy. there is one shower on the floor i was on and 3 more modern showers upstairs. only bad thing this area of hermosa is where people go to have fun and it will keep you from getting to sleep, particularly since the hostel is above a bar and grill with live reggae bands"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,6,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was the best thing i saw in la.  staff were friendly, guests were good fun, nice place to be."
England,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,great hostel would highly recommend!  has a quality atmosphere with things always happening. the french lady who runs it is lovely aswell and the breakfast is pretty decent. only downside is that it could maybe do with another shower.
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"everything was great. a little dissapointed with what was provided for breakfast... nothing fresh or healthy. otherwise, we have no other complaints. had a great weekend."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is by far my favorite hostel in california, for one your right across the bike path from the ocean! everytime i stay at this hostel i alway meet some new friends."
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,10,4,10,8,6,10,6,"the women working here are fabulous! however, came back to a crazy person in my room and some of my food from the fridge was stolen by a transient that got in. i would stay here again tho...loved the location!"
England,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"good for the beach, less ideal for exloring the rest of la (apart from long beach)"
USA,Female,41+,4.6,6,2,6,4,8,4,2,"this hostel is dirty, above a noisy bar, parking is street parking a half mile away. staff friendly but when i wanted to ask a question i waited for 15 minutes while she continued a personal conversation.  better choice is hi hostel in santa monica. "
Germany,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"its not to far away from the airport! it feels like everything is far away from eachother here in la.   the hostel it self is good, i had a fun time. breakfast was yummy.   at the weekend its a little louder beacuse there are bars downstairs. which i didn't mind."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"actually i am unable to comment on this hostel, as although we made our reservation about 4 or 5 months ago, when i emailed them about 5 days before we were due to arrive to confirm, i received an email saying they had a problem with their booking system and now didn't have a room for us! which basically means they put priority over the people who made their reservation after us and kicked us out. i have stayed at this hostel in the past and was very disappointed with this service. horrible. "
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,best experience of my life. coming back for sure.
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,6,8,8,2,"i was put in a room with people that had clearly been living there for a while and it was a total mess and so dirty. all their clothes,  accessories, makeup, hair products, shoes were scattered all over the room. the bed was really uncomfortable and the window was thin so all the noise from the bars underneath and across the street keep you up until around 3am. i met cool people here so i had a good time but if you want a good night sleep or somewhere a little more comfortable i wouldn't go here"
NewZealand,Male,31-40,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,"nice small hostel, right by the airport and well connected to the rest of the city by bus and train. good little kitchen and a cosy, homely atmosphere to the place. nowhere to store valuables though (lockers). apart from that a good place to stay on a visit to seattle."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,great staff and location - will definitely stay here again!
Sweden,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great hostel! near the beach, cheap, great facilities and next to loooots of bars."
Netherlands,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"nice hostel, friendly and helpfull staff. we wanted to rent a car amd whem something went wrong the girl at reception helped us very good! she gave good information and tips about what to visit in la and what not.  the rooms are a bit small but nice amd we had a view on the ocean.  the only thing was that the toilet in our room was not working the last two days.  overall we had a really nice stay.    kitchen was a bit small but th"
Mexico,Male,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"one of the people who went to sleep late actually worked there, but he would still turn on the light every time (he came in  and out several times throughout the night)."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,cool location right on the beach but be warned.. the public bus takes over an hour to get from the bus depot near lax to the hostel. keep in mind for if you're in a hurry/don't have much time. otherwise the hotel is a bit dilapidated but ok.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"great location for checking out venice and is only a short bus ride away from santa monica. staff are friendly and the rooms do the trick. kitchen facilities are fine. only hangup was the lack of atmosphere in the actual hostel, although they did offer pub crawls and other activities. may be because of a relatively small communal space. showers on the reception level had trouble with hot water while i was there, not sure if the problem has been rectified."
Indonesia,Male,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,"just fit! was all good except the name wasn't really describing about the surf, which was a total flat when i was there."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very excellent hostel. very helpful staff. great place to relax for a few days.
England,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i got here straight from lax. the location is great, right next to the beach. the hostel attracts a lot of surfer dudes, friendly and chilled-out types. i think it's more suited to solo travellers (like me) than big groups."
USA,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,i felt safe at this hostel and the staff were very friendly and helpful.   they had bikes for rent (cheap) and the cost of our stay was very affordable! we ended up staying an extra night
USA,Male,41+,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,everything was ok.
USA,Female,25-30,4.6,2,6,6,8,4,2,4,wifi very weak
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"if possible invest in nice ear plugs for hire...so that if people are worried about the noise they can just purchase some good noise cancelling ear plugs. great hostel overall, keep up the customer service and friendly staff. :)"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,great place to relax and enjoy the beach. free breakfast was great would fill up and last till dinner! overall great place to stay.
Brazil,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,8,8,8,8,8,"good location in front of the beach and a lot of bar with dance floor closed to the hostel. only problem: the drinks are so expensive on the bars, you can drink on the hostel before going out."
India,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,8,8,8,6,6,the staff were really friendly and super helpful!
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay. right in the middle of prime night life and right next to the strand. had a great time here!
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,"francis was really helpful, also george who saved me a lot of time by giving me a cheap lift to the airport! only downside really is that its difficult to get anywhere with public transport from hermosa beach."
Italy,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,excellent place and good situated... i had much much fun.. in hermosa u can find everything u want :)
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,10,10,8,6,8,"awesome location for the beach, and fronts right onto a pedestrian-only mall with bars, coffee shops, etc.    all of la requires a car if you are going to see the sights, and this location is no exception."
Finland,MixedGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"hostel didn't really organize common activities, maybe it was low-season. however, we got a 6 bed room even though we had booked private room just for 4 us, and 1 was supposed to stay in dorms, thanks for that! :) hostel surroundings were nice, right next to hermosa beach. good place to stay, but not one of the best hostels i've stayed. ask about the transportation to/from the airport, they can help you with that!"
England,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"nice enough hostel, if you like to surf or like the beach its ideal, 2min walk and your at the beach. however everything else is quite far away, 1 half - 2 hours to hollywood for example... otherwise clean enough and staff are friendly and helpful"
Australia,Male,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,4,8,6,6,the place was cool but a visable sign/entry and some computers for client use wouldn't go astray.....
Wales,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,great place to stay on the beach!!! coming back
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,this place is a hidden gem and i really enjoyed meeting the other travelers staying here. the staff was very chill and friendly. overall i don't have a single bad thing to say and i'd definitely stay here again.
Slovenia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"hostel was great, as well as the staff. they try really hard to help you with whatever you need. the location was excellent, 5 meters away the sea, so it's the perfect hostel to spend relaxing holidays there. i was very satisfied with everything, i had such a great time there!"
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"beutiful setting, loads of things to do nearby. little bit noisy late at night if your not up for that kind of thing. really friendly staff and amazing breakfast selection."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place, have stayed many times and will stay many more."
Poland,Female,18-24,6.9,6,4,8,6,8,8,8,"we got to the room close bars kitchen, so the evening was a terrible smell of burnt oil.  location good, very close to the ocean, but far from downtown la, but communication very good :)  little loud."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,8,6,10,6,2,6,6,"over all i thought surf city hostel was pretty good. i only stayed two nights and both of them were fine, the only problems were: it's on top of a bar so if your jet laged like i was not the best place for your first nights rest. staff member candy was rude and probably shouldn't be working in a hospitality work environment. most of the other staf member were helpful and polite. location is wicked! i had a really good night on my second night with all the bars under the hostel."
USA,Female,31-40,4,2,2,8,2,6,4,4,the wost hostel i've stayed in.
Norway,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,10,6,"the surf city hostel has an amazing atmosphere, the frenche woman working in the office treats you like she's your good godmother. amazing location, right on the beach and hermosa is a chilled, relaxed and cool place to meet happy and lively people. you can rent a bike at the hostel and go for a ride up the great beach path that leads you all the way to venice and santa monica. up the street from the hostel there is a few cool shops, i recommend the store; ""wicked"" they have loads of cool stuff!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,this hostel has the perfect location! right by the pier and all the bars (its actually located right on top of one) and close to la and hollywood and of course its right on the beach. could not ask for more from a hostel in so-cal. the staff is very friendly and accommodating. i will definitely be going back any time i need to stay in south bay.
USA,Female,41+,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,they could not honor my booking.  i got a $48.00 parking ticket for lodging near the hawthorne airport lax.  i spent $60.00 on a parking pass to lodge in hermosa beach.  my credit card was charged and i never spent even one night.  i am asking for a refund.  they say that this booking company gets the money from the booking on my card not them.  they were unable to check me in when i arrived.  i love them.  i am not a man.  i am also american.  they have been good to me in the past.this time$$$$
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,6,4,10,4,8,6,6,"i stayed in surf city hostel for three nights. the location was great, however living space was virtually non existent compared to other hostels i have occupied. if location is everything to you and you aren't wanting to hang out in the hostel during the day, this is a good option. great bars downstairs and along pier st. located smack bang on the beach, among the beach volley ballers!!"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great location, would highly reccomend to anyone planning to stay in a hostel in l.a. great location, 30 seconds walk and your on the beach.cool area lots of pubs and resturaunts. very surf/skate relaxed vibe to area.  the hostel has two lounges to relax in, just the rooms upstairs need fans or aircon as got very stuffy and hot at night. staff very friendly and helpful. but i think price could be lowered 5 or ten dollars.also plastic sheets a bit uncomfortable, and need more lockers in each room!"
CzechRepublic,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,"i truly recommend this hostel. the cheapest and the best hostel i stayed in during my summer trip! if you are looking for a place close to beach for surfing and a good location full of bars at night, it is definitely a place for you! if you wanna have fun at the bars, just be careful and start soon because the bars close around 2am which kinda scared me, haha. staff is amazing, rooms are pretty clean, laundry available, tons of international guys, bike rent available! have fun :)"
USA,Female,41+,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,there were some issues with the plumbing and the toilets and showers were closed for a period of time but this affected the entier building and not just the hostel units.  the staff worked dillegiently to call in help to resolve the problem.  i was only there for a night so it wasn't a terrible inconvience and there are public bathrooms near the pier which is located very close to the hostel.  this issue didn't affect my stay.
Germany,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a nice place to stay, you step out of the hostel and you are right at the beach. the rooms are nice and clean and the stuff is really nice."
SouthAfrica,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,6,6,"the hostel served its purpose as an inexpensice place to spend the night in la. the location is great as it's on the beach and the staff were helpful enough. the only problem with the location is that the hostel is located above a bar and so it is noisy and difficult to fall asleep (even with earplugs). but if partying is your thing and you don't mind the noise, then this is the perfect place for you. recommendation: rent a car for la - very difficult to ger around without one!"
England,Female,25-30,5.1,4,6,6,6,4,4,6,staff couldnt care less. i booked a 4 bed dorm and got a 6 bed dorm above the loudest bar ever! no sleep arghhh!!
Italy,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i love this hostel!  i certainly suggest!    davide esposito
Ireland,MixedGroup,18-24,7.4,6,6,8,6,10,8,8,staff were very helpful and understanding
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"amazing staff, amazing location, just a great place to stay and meet people. really good party atmosphere and close to all the bars."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i had an awesome experience staying at surf city hostel. the staff very fantastic and personable, the hostel was clean and well maintained, and best of all- the location was to die for. i went down for a week with a friend and we had the best time hanging out in hermosa beach. we met tons of people at the hostel and the streets are busy and full of life at night. hermosa has great restaurants, shopping, nightlife, and stunning beaches. it's definitely worth a visit!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,10,6,"the hostel was perfect!  nice and helpful staff, the facilities were clean and the location directly on the beach! nothing to complain  :)"
Chile,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,8,8,8,"ok, it is a good hostel, near to the beach, restaurants and pubs. the breakfast is pretty good and the beds are comfortable.   cons: few restrooms and they are always busy. the common areas are not comfortable and there are few chances to meet people."
Spain,Male,25-30,4.6,6,2,8,4,6,4,2,"small room, very bad smells, noise in the night...it is worth to spend a little more money and stay in a hotel"
England,MixedGroup,18-24,4.9,2,6,8,6,4,4,4,"it wasn't made clear enough that this hostel is above a club. if i had known this in the first place, i wouldn't have booked at all. i was extremely disappointed when i arrived and found this as, after a long days travelling, i couldn't even get a decent nights sleep due to the loud music, and the fact that it felt as though a house party was going on. i don't think there were enough bathrooms for the number of people that were being put up and the place could generally do with a refurbishment."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostels iv been in. so many great people and lots of memorys have been made there. a must go place to stay.
Switzerland,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,8,8,8,4,8,"depends what you're looking for; it's in the middle of a party-area and right at the beach... perfect, unless you're looking for a quiet place!"
Italy,Couple,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"we spend three nights in the hostel and had a fantastic time! the location in ideal, right in the street of pubs and bars and next to the beach, which looks much better than the overcrowded venice beach. only minus, the mixed dorm is right up on one of the pubs, so it's quite loud at night...if you are noise-sensitive, bring good earplugs."
England,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,"surf city was totally fantastic. amazing location, every morning i walked out of the door and strait onto the beach for a swim. the staff a really friendly and the place has a great atmosphere. i needed to be in santa monica on my last night in la and the hostel was more expensive and no where near as nice. surf city is simple, friendly and very welcoming and the location is absolutely perfect!"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great staff. friendly environment, good security. great location"
Australia,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"special thanks to odeil (spelling??) the french woman, did nothing but help when i had passport problems..thank you.  place is noisy as reviews but hey, you are amongst it..."
Ireland,Male,18-24,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,great place to visit. great craic around the place.   meet some cool people there. and i will defo go back.
Brazil,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"loved my stay. most of the employees treated us excellently. two young female employees however, were rude to us"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"the old french lady that runs the place is the sweetest woman alive, her employees are quite rude and unhelpful. stick to dealing with the french woman and you will have the time of your life."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"absolute blast and the location can't be beat if you are looking to be in the heart of all the activity.  the only downside is that a few of the rooms are directly over a bar.  if you end up in one of these, good luck trying to get some sleep before the bar closes.  the solution is to stay in the bar until it closes...."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,10,8,"i stayed there last year already and i don't regret chosing this hosstel again. located directly at the beach, connected to the public transportation and safe neighborhood to many bars and clubs. the parking situation is difficult, i wouldn't recommend getting a rental car. if necessary, park your car in the side streets of the pch, 16th or 14th street."
France,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,"i had such a great time here. i was here for five nights and i was sad to leave. people who work here are very helpful and provide good tips if you ask. the breakfast is nice, the common room are a good way to meet people. the hostel is on pier avenue, where a lot of pubs play music in the evening. it might be hard to sleep but you'll have good time if you like going out! i truely recommand this hostel to everybody who wants to enjoy the beach and easy going life for hollidays!"
Portugal,AllMaleGroup,18-24,5.4,4,4,10,4,6,2,8,"it's above a bar, there's no free parking nearby, the rooms are tiny and in the room we stayed the other two guests seem to live there. also at some point  could hear two people arguing loudly and i think one of them was a staff member. also at night someone in another room had loud music.  the only good thing is that it's literally across the street from the beach, and there are several bars/restaurants nearby."
Netherlands,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"nice hostel, near the beach and right into a little surf-village. if you're lucky you have a room with sea-view. if you stay here to sleep a lot: don't go!! the pubs and bars are playing loud music until 2 am. you'll hear it very well on both of the floors. nice rooms, very little kitchen for the many guests. breakfast very simple. party place: yes! quiet place: no!"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,very cool hostel. 30 seconds to the beach and right next to all the bars/restuarants bike hire/bus etc etc. awesome stay. very helpful and friendly staff. free breakfast and met plenty of new people.
Australia,Male,25-30,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,had an enjoyable 2 nights stay here. it's in a great location right in the hermosa beach mall. some great nightlife nearby and that endless l.a. beach can be seen from some of the rooms. the staff were very friendly and helpful. it's a long way from downtown l.a. so if you wanna see all that hollywood stuff probably best to stay elsewhere. but if you want to avoid the plastic paradise and see a more relaxed l.a. this is the place for you.
DominicanRepublic,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is my second stay at surf city. i love the location, the staff, and the atmosphere the most. :) it is run very well, an th price is right. i close bats down, so it's right up my alley. :)"
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"fantastic location, simple setup."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,fantastic la beach front experience. i recommend this hostel.
HongKong,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"the location is excellent, but another problem is too noise during the during, because many bars under the hostel. so far it is the best hostel i visited."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,"mixed dorms, lots for breakfast, right on the beach in a safe neighbourhood, french/american owners.    cons, small at times for space, but whatta heck it's not the hilton. i woke up every morning to waves."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the accommodation made my girlfriend very upset to the point we checked in and within an hour had checked out, no offer of a small sum back on what we had just paid. very deceiving description of the property! avoid at all costs"
Germany,MixedGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,loved the location by the beach and the opportunity to rent bikes. very friendly staff. didn't like the plastic covers for the mattress and pillow. all in all a very neat place to stay for good money.
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"stayed for four nights, the location in hermosa beach was great with lots of bars and restaurants close by. the room was nice and clean and had an an suite which was good, the other bathrooms was very nice as well. you could ent a towel for free and the second one was 1 dollar so that was very good if you dont have much space in your bags for towels. overall i haad a very good stay!"
Canada,Female,25-30,6.9,6,6,8,4,10,8,6,"great location, except that it was quite loud.  the mattresses could definitely use some upgrading as they were tough to sleep on since you could feel every spring."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,8,6,at night it was really loud because there were bars just under the hostel.
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"surf city was a great place to stay, namely because of the location. you can see hermosa beach from your window, and it's also right on pier avenue where there are restaurants and shops and bars. great place to be. it's also not too noisy if you did prefer a more chilled night. the only issue with the location is that it is far away from downtown la and the public transport is a nightmare. but we just booked a tour that picked us up from a nearby hotel. simple! clean, nice rooms and bathroom."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,8,10,great hostel with really helpful staff.. absolutely no complains!! thanks..
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,4,8,10,8,8,"staff were extremely helpful - went out of their way to make sure you were happy and help you find places to go etc. even gave us coupons to save on food shopping! free breakfast was best we've had in 4 months of travelling. only downside to this hostel is the location. whilst its set right next to a beautiful beach, its next to a lot of bars so is noisy at night and it is also quite far from downtown la/hollywood etc so takes a fair amount of your day up just travelling there and back."
Germany,Female,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,awesome time !!!
Canada,MixedGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the top hostels i have stayed in. everything was amazing, from the location (can't beat it) to the staff, to the people staying there. we had more fun there than any stay on our trip! thanks surf city, i will be back fro sure!"
USA,Male,41+,7.7,8,8,10,8,4,8,8,"i had booked here for a week and decided to cancel after a night (wanted my own room and thier ""privates"" were more then at a hotel), but they wouldn't refund my all my money- kept an extra night's stay even though it was 9am! so charged for 2 nights and only stayed for one, even a hotel doesn't treat you like this, otherwise great location with ocean views, but after a few nights there isn't much new to see or do."
Chile,Male,25-30,6,4,2,10,8,6,8,4,"i've been in hostels in europe and south america. in terms of cleanliness and safety this one is one is really poor, for instance, anyone could bring other people to the rooms. the place is perfect anyway (given that you're faaaar from hollywood)."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. staff is very friendly and accommodating. loved the location and wasn't too loud at night where you couldn't sleep even though there are a lot of bars around. loved everything about it!!
Sweden,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,8,10,hermosa is beautiful and your hostel got everything you need!
France,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved it so much that i stayed one more night :-)  i will come back next time i am in la!
Brazil,Female,25-30,4,2,4,8,2,6,4,2,not a fair price to what is offered.
Australia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"my second stay at surf city, would definately stay there again. its not the 'nicest' hostel i've ever stayed in but you can't fault that location, i could see the beach from my window"
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"only there for one night but was great fun, really lovely people, great location next to the beach.. wish i didn't have to leave so soon!"
Australia,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"one of the best places we stayed at in 3 weeks in the usa. the staff were all very friendly and helpful, we wanted a place near the beach and i don't think we could have been any closed. less than 100m from front door to sand. the surrounding area was full of excellent bars and restaurants and the hostel itself was really nice."
Japan,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really fun place! i'll be come back here:d
Ireland,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"great location right on the beach at hermosa and near some of the best bars i have ever been in most notable hennessys,the staff were very nice and the girl from montana drove me to the airport for free a nice tip is encouraged.met some really interesting people in the hostel but the facilities are quite basic so i did not spend any time in the place"
Spain,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay and socialize with many others. i would recommend it.
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,thumbs up!  great place to stay
England,Male,,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,a very funky hostel a few steps away from hermosa beach and right in the middle of some good bars and restaurants.
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,10,6,8,overall a good hostel! very close to the beach! staff were very friendly! there were quite a few long term people who had formed a clique which made it uncomfortable!   the common area was tiny! too many rooms! knock a couple of walls out to make some space!
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"3rd time staying there and it's delivered everytime, it's   no 5 star but what it is is a friendly warm hostel that seems  to attract good people, the guys you meet there are   always friendly and obliging. i recommend it but girls   it ain't the ritz so if you plan on staying a few weeks be prepared"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this was an awesome hostel to stay at. unfortunately, due to the size of l.a. it is pretty much impossible to get around the city without a hire car. this hostel is great, in a really nice part of l.a. on a really nice beach. the staff are great and always helpful and nice."
China,Male,18-24,7,0,8,6,0,8,8,4,"if you want to go to beach and have fun then location is not a matter, but it takes a long time to go to downtown especially you don't rent a car and have to take bus."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"awesome place! surfed everyday, steps from the beach and tons of rental shops on the block. fun and friendly staff."
USA,Female,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,overall people were wonderful felt like a big part of a family  the accommodations were good.  the only thing i can suggest is to fix showers and make sure windows r repaired for safety. i will definitely come back to stay miss everyone already so sweet  oh and bar under neath wow hard to get sum slep :)
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff are lovely, helpful. hostel is clean and in a great location right next to hermose beach."

France,Female,25-30,9,0,10,10,0,10,10,6,great great hostel!!! i would definitely recommend it to anyone! the staff is ready to help you for anything (even for a cheap ride to the airport or rent a car). the location is just perfect!!! the only so so thing to me was the bathroom... shared and really no intimacy at all...
Italy,Female,25-30,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,8,8,"it was really nice to stay in this hostel,the staff is really friendly and they give you all the information you need. my room has a beautiful ocean view. the kitchen is not so big but for that reason is like stay at home!"
USA,MixedGroup,31-40,7.7,0,6,8,0,10,6,8,"here's the deal, this hostel is in a great location with exception of the bar it's sits on top of. the staff are friendly and helpful no doubt. however, if you have a room on the second floor you will not be able to go to sleep till 2 am due to the music from the bar downstairs. so if you can't beat em, join em right? well if your in the mood for joinin em it's cool,  but if you've got better things to do, your sleep schedule being dictated by the bar downstairs sucks."
Finland,Couple,18-24,9,0,8,8,0,10,8,10,"nice hostel with very friendly staff and clean rooms and bathrooms, also the beds were really comfy. a lot of bars and restaurants close by which is good but you also hear the loud music to your room. there was a little breakfast included, mainly toast with peanut butter and jam. we had a car and had to park it quite far to get free parking which was a little bit annoying but close to where we had to park there was a good supermarket in where you got a discount when you stayed at surf city."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.3,0,6,10,0,10,8,8,everyone was really helpful
Bulgaria,Male,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,the hostel and the people i have met there were great! :) i was feeling very cozy and worm! :) and the location was perfect! :)
Germany,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,6,"best hostel ever!  i stayed in a 6-bed female dorm and it was awesome. i had the most amazing sea view. ;) the people i met were really cool. the staff is very friendly, fun and helpful. the place is perfect: hermosa beach is gorgeous! and if you stay there during low season, there isn't as much noise from the bars. but if you're sensitive, you should bring ear plugs. ;)  all in all, i really enjoyed it and i will definitely recommend this hostel!"
Germany,Female,18-24,8,0,8,8,0,10,8,6,"friendly people, fun place, very close to the beach ( i could see it from the shower) taxis are close. just the internet was a bit slow. in total i would recommend it!"
Australia,Female,31-40,9,0,10,8,0,8,10,8,i was only there for a night but made friends straight away with people hanging out there.  the place is kept pretty clean and it's bang on the beach.  if you can handle a laid back surf culture hostel then this is great.  it's an old building but that just gives it some character.  there's free parking up the street or you can park behind the hostel but you have to pay. you can ride bikes up to santa monica along the beach.
Australia,Female,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"lovely friendly staff, felt like a home away from home.  bike rental was so much fun, thank you!"
Australia,Male,31-40,9.3,0,10,10,0,8,10,8,great place to beach party
England,Male,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,6,8,"superbly located hostel, right on a fantastic beach and surrounded by vibrant bars and restaurants, in what feels like a very safe area. staff very helpful, providing guests with beach towels and body/boogie boards free of charge. bedrooms quite small however, and with few showers/toilets per floor. extremely noisy at night (in my 1st floor, street-facing room) until 1am though, as the bars' bass comes directly through the floor and the windows - although if you're out partying, no problem!"
China,Female,31-40,7,0,6,10,0,8,8,4,"good location, with beach, pub, restaurants, shops,and so on. not far from airport."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,i loved it there! right at the beach and a lot lf fun!
Australia,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,really great! location could not be better! really fun atmosphere
Germany,Male,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,"we had a great time there, spent a whole week in a super hostel! nice staff, clean rooms, awesome location. international audience, i heard english, german, french, spanish etc. :)  especially if you're travelling alone, this is the perfect place to stay. you meet a lot of people in the kitchen (real kitchen, everything's there to cook), the tv room or the ""living room"""
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,8,6,"great place to stay, but very pokey.  not a great deal of room.  however the staff were superb and helped me out of a jam on a very. very frustrating day.  gets noisy at night in the plaza below, but you are guaranteed the partying will stop at 2am, no later, as the local by-laws are very strict.  if i went to la i'd stay there again for sure."
Germany,Male,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"very nice location on the beach, but far away from downtown and the greyhoundbus station. so if you plan to go to downtown check another hostel, but for a beach vacation it´s perfect. very safe area, many bars and restaurants. the rooms are okay, bathroom was clean."
Germany,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"perfect hostel! location is very good - exclusively nice houses, cool bars, good beach!  the hostel is very (!) clean, the bathroom is unisex .. :) ..., the rooms are not the biggest, but it's perfect for travelers who search hostels and who don't really need luxury big rooms and for that price you won't get such nice rooms and such a good location at hermosa beach. definitely worth a stay!!!"
USA,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i had a blast staying here.  it's a small place so you have a great chance to meet people.  i would definitely stay here again.  right on the beach!!!
Canada,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,8,8,6,cute location. loud neighbors. beautiful beach. friendly people.
England,Female,18-24,5.3,0,4,10,0,4,6,4,"we were given a room with two live in residents so we had no space whatsoever and felt as though we were living in someone else's bedroom, this was quite uncomfortable and unwelcoming"
Italy,Male,25-30,6.3,0,6,6,0,6,8,6,l ostello nn e male discreta pulizia disponibili per tutto  dove situato ci sono diverrsi pub dover ci si diverte   sopprattutto nei weekend senza usare l auto
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,0,6,6,0,10,8,6,"hey together!! it was a relaxing and funny stay at the surf city hostel.   my problem was that i didn't like it that much in hermosa. i drove every day to santa monica because there was way more going on. hermosa is really quiet. little shopping and nightlife possibilities (my opinion). further there was no computer and no lockers in the hostel.   but, it was direct to the beach and the people there are very nice and helpfull :)   greez"
USA,Female,18-24,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"i loved my stay with surf city hostel. i ended up working in exchange for my room and stayed for over a month. the hostel is right on the beach and next to several bars and restaurants from high end to very affordable. there is some loud music from said bars and clubs at night, but i slept without any issues. the rooms and entire facilities are cleaned every day and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. a lot of the tenants come back year after year to this same hostel!"
Spain,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"the location is awesome because it's not near the beach, it's in the beach, but it's like 50 minutes by car from l.a. this is in hermosa beach, so if you don't have a car, you're screwed if you want to see things from l.a.    but if you have a car, this is great."
CzechRepublic,Male,41+,7.3,0,6,10,0,6,6,8,"ok, no park lot"
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,0,6,10,0,8,10,8,awesome... so much fun... party every night... and really great people :)
Denmark,Male,18-24,7.3,0,4,8,0,8,10,8,"very good location for partying and going to the beach! wifi doesn't reach all rooms though, and there are no personal lockers. really good for chillin'"
HolySee(vaticanCityState),Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had an awesome time. this hostel is one of a kind. i loved the staff and the location. highly recommend this place!!!!
Brazil,Male,25-30,5.7,0,4,8,0,6,8,4,"character - old building, old photos from place, the description from hostel world should be updated.    security - i saw some people from others places sleeping there, even tourists that register for 2 and stay 3.     staff - they are doing what's possible, on that conditions.    cleanliness - i stayed in one bedroom with some guys that used to live there, so... it's their home inside the bedroom."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.3,0,10,8,0,10,10,10,"great hostel, great staff, a lot of fun. the only annoying thing is that it's pretty complicated to reach the ""more interesting"" parts of la from the hostel."
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,0,6,8,0,8,6,4,this place is great - if you're coming to the area to get drunk and party your ass off n a surfer.  other than that purpose this isn't close to actual la life/fun - it's a 20 minute drive from la and that could longer depending on traffic.and bonus it's on the beach.
Australia,Male,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"this is a great location and the atmosphere at the hostel is great, staff were very friendly and the night life is close and fun, the area is a little expensive though"
Australia,Male,31-40,9,0,8,10,0,8,10,8,"the place is awesome... sweet location but the only slight down falls i found that other hostels have is the lack of lock up facilities for valuables, a few of the staff werent so friendly and since the place wasnt brand spanker new it wasnt the cleanest, all in all i would definately stay there again and recoment it to friends and travellers... thanks guys for my first experience to la."
Canada,MixedGroup,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,this hostel is in an amazing location.  right on the beautiful beach and around plenty of resturants and stores.  the staff was super helpful and very friendly.  i would deffinately stay here again!
France,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,best hostel ever.
Germany,Female,31-40,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,far away from the citycenter but hermosa is fun and safe and pretty.   we got dorms with ocean-view! located right between a nice strip of bars... (be prepared for loud music at night). the bathrooms are without any options to withdraw but clean... a homelike atmo with 2 cute commonrooms and very nice staff ...
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,0,10,6,0,10,6,8,"great place if you are looking for a beach hang out, don't stay here if you will be spending a lot of time downtown."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"as my first stop in america, i would highly recommend. this hostel doesn't feel cold or uninviting, but more like a welcoming little community, which helps you adjust quickly, especially as a solo traveller.  the resident hostel dwellers will welcome you in with warm greetings, and you'll find it difficult to move on once you arrive......excellent location, excellent hostel.....would recommend to all international travellers.....x"
England,Couple,25-30,7,0,8,10,0,6,6,6,"great location-right above shops, bars,so nice to chill in bar at evening, though you may hear music from pubs at weekends-bring ear plugs and you will be fine...  common kitchen and areas need updating-tiny kitchen with everyone fighting for space at dinner times-not good!  seems like the majority of lodgers are more long term rather than people travelling and moving on which we didnt really like..this made us feel like we were intruding.  annette on front desk lovely and helpful!!"
NewZealand,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"be warned: it is very loud. there's a bar downstairs and heaps of other bars nearby. the location is excellent; right by the beach which we could see from our window. it's clean, staff are friendly and it's handy to lax. we would stay again."
Brazil,Female,,4,0,6,2,0,6,4,2,"first of all: the hostel is not located in la. it's at hermosa beach a way to far from the city. if you want a stay on the beach with young people having fun, thats fine, but don't go there thinking about la. i felt cheated. i should had stayed for 4 nights and spent only two until find out a new hostel to move in.  the mattresses are old and the cleanliness is poor.  the place is on the top of a bar so is too noise at night.  the staff are really nice, though."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,8.7,0,10,6,0,10,8,10,"i  really enjoyed my experience staying in this hostel.  there was a great, friendly vibe amongst everyone, including the staff.  it was big enough to house a lot of backpackers, but small enough to maintain a tight culture.  right next to the beach, which was cool!  a long way from hollywood, and loud music until 2 pm may deter some guests."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"super lage, 30 meter vom strand entfernt, direkt an der promenade, fahrrã¤der ausleibar fã¼r $10/tag. tolle fahrradtour nach santa monica mã¶glich.   sehr freundliches und gut gelauntes personal. wertsachen kann man im bã¼ro abgeben wenn man wo hingeht.  frã¼hstã¼ck ist ok.  die bars unter und neben dem hostel schlieãen um 2uhr morgens(law)- das ist blã¶d fã¼r die die lange feiern wollen aber gut fã¼r die die gerne ruhig schlafen und gut fã¼r den geldbeutel :)"
Scotland,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"this was my first experience of a hostel and it exceeded my expectations. thank you for a wonderful first time, all other hostels now have your standards to live up to."
Spain,MixedGroup,25-30,7,0,8,6,0,8,6,8,"this place is fairly good. clean enough, good enough breakfast, wifi, security, nice staff... but overall it rates average. and it's quite far from anywhere in los angeles but, well, that's los angeles, right?"
Canada,Female,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,amazing times there!!
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,10,"surf city hostel was my favourtie of all the hostels i stayed at while in la. it had the best location. i was a 21 year old girl travelling by myself and i felt so safe - the staff are always present and the intimate, community feel of this hostel meant i made so many friends.  loved it!!!"
UK,Male,25-30,4.7,0,6,2,0,4,6,6,had to wait 2 hrs to get into room even though i had booked. location is bad. takes 3 hrs to get to hollywood. manager is french and cant understand a word she says. would not stay again
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.3,0,4,8,0,8,8,4,"hostel was ok, but there were no lockers in the room and it had not been cleaned for at least some days."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.3,0,8,10,0,8,6,6,"this hostel is certainly rough around the edges but if you're looking for somewhere away from the touristy spots where you'll meet other travellers then surf city is okay. the rooms and bathrooms are very bare, if not too basic (a mirror in the bedrooms would be helpful for women travellers!) so don't expect much, and there is a lot of noise from the bars downstairs so pack ear plugs!!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,had an amazing time staying at the surf city so close to the parties hermosa has to offer and the beach bike path is right out side with $10 bike hire well worth it!  will go back and visit again.
Netherlands,Male,31-40,9.3,0,6,10,0,10,10,10,"a wonderful hostel where you are bound to meet new people. not a place for people that do not like noise nor party. if you want to sleep early, make sure you bring earplugs, but much better, join the fun and sleep late.    the security of the hostel is virtually non-existent, however, no security is needed as i've never felt as safe as in this hostel. people were using notebooks on the free wifi, and i felt comfortable with leaving it unguarded on my dorm-room. so did my room-mates."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,8,great place at a great beach!!! staff was great!! so was the atmosphere!!! be back!!!
England,Male,25-30,7.3,0,6,10,0,8,8,6,"location is pretty good, right on the beach and loads of bars and places to eat right on the doorstep. showers are a little rank and the dorms are tatty but pretty cheap in comparison to other places in la. would deffo give it another go if i'm in la again."
France,Female,25-30,7.3,0,6,10,0,8,6,8,good hostel. you can rent bikes there. 50meters from the seaside! some members of the personnel were a bit rude.
Venezuela,AllFemaleGroup,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is in an excellent location; in the heart of westwood/ucla with a huge supermarket, target, cvs pharmacy, trader joe's and buses within 2 to 3 blocks that can take you anywhere in los angeles county. it is a new hostel, recently built. it is a large spacious place, quiet with a large modern kitchen well equipped. there is parking on site feb 2018 10 usd overnight. it is at the corner of hillgard and leconte. beds are comfortable, individually built. staff helpful on whatever u need. "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"podshare westwood is the cleanest american hostel i've stayed in. ample kitchen and bathroom spaces, both well organized and meticulously cleaned. pods come with built-in storage, lamps, and outlets. 10/10 amenities everywhere: double outlets in each bunk, double microwaves in the kitchen, easy to find fridge space and i've never had to wait for a bathroom stall or shower because there are so many to choose from. staff is friendly and accommodating, as well. would definitely recommend!"
USA,Female,41+,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,hi.  this property was under construction when i arrived.  there was glass doors leaning against the walls in the hallways.  people still painting.  men with drills in the showers.  no private toilets.  exposed plug in/  no security locks on my locker.  no access to front door.  people were staying there for free in lieu of work. (illegal).  i had to call the police and i contacted the city and filed a complaint.  they are investigating.
Canada,Male,41+,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,8,6,free coffee
SouthAfrica,Female,41+,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"when i first read previous reviews i was disappointed in the many low scores, particularly as i'd just come from a fabulous, cheaper hostel in san diego. on arrival i thought i'd also be fairly negative. however! i was very pleasantly surprised to discover that the place suffers only from age! the staff are extremely helpful,keep it as clean as possible and create a sense of community. yes, i made an effort to involve myself but why go to a hostel if you're not interested in like-minded people? "
Hungary,Female,25-30,6.3,6,4,10,8,10,4,2,"i stayed in many hostels but this has a very strange vibe. this guy walked into our room with his gf without any problems, he wasn’t even a guest there and it was an all female room. the hostel smelled very bad and was quite dodgy. but it is the perfect location and the staff was very sweet. also nice breakfast and well equipped kitchen. "
USA,Male,31-40,5.7,4,6,10,4,8,4,4,"i cancelled this reservation after going to front desk and learning about all the rules that must have been listed in super fine print or weren’t listed at all like not being allowed to have guests or food in my private room; locked doors at 4am where i can’t get into the building after that, zero air conditioning in room i’m sleeping in etc etc. hostelworld should do better at making these type of rules very obvious as i would have looked for a different location."
Australia,Female,41+,7.7,8,10,10,10,4,6,6,great location. good facilities. needs a leader-all staff seem to be volunteers and arguing amongst each other.  but great spot. o would stay there again
Philippines,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,the staff was really accommodating. will definitely stay here again in the future. 
USA,Female,25-30,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"i never actually stayed here. tried to call, email and left a message to cancel to avoid booking fees but still got charged. i'm sure it's a nice spot it has good ratings but my experience only involved purchasing a service i never used."
Australia,Male,25-30,3.1,4,2,8,2,2,2,2,the bedrooms and common areas were very dirty and uninviting - didn't feel too secure and staff weren't all that accomodating or warming
Denmark,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,8,8,8,4,the breakfast was great! but it would have been nice to hear more about the free dinner..  this hostel have really good potential too become really really nice. unfortunately the energi level is not that high.
USA,Male,18-24,5.1,6,2,10,2,4,8,4,i felt like i was in jail when going to bed. literally 80° in the room and no a/c. everything is dirty. the beds are ok. saw a cockroach in the room. overall a 2/10 experience. staff was nice.
England,Male,25-30,5.1,6,4,6,4,6,6,4,"seen a rat in that back room and the locations good but not suitable for all due to the homeless people who gather on the beach, which is right next to the hostel"
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,6,4,8,6,10,8,2,"the hostel had a good atmosphere, everyone was very friendly &amp; welcoming. lisa at the front desk was lovely. we booked the ""deluxe 7 bed dorm"" not realising that meant there would be 6 bunk beds in the room plus one single bed off to the side. it was very cramped &amp; smelled bad, wasn't very clean. the room had no air conditioning so was extremely warm. kitchen/common area unclean. it's in a good location in that it's right next to venice beach although we found we preferred santa monica.  "
Australia,Male,18-24,3.1,2,4,6,2,4,2,2,really old and unclean place with no atmosphere. the best part was that it motivated you to leave the hostel and go exploring. 
USA,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,8,2,6,6,2,"the only decent thing about this hostel is the location. the facilities are dirty &amp; run down. there were dirty blankets left in our room and visible piles of dust &amp; dirt on the windows and ceiling fan. there was broken glass on our floor that one of us stepped on. they allow guests to smoke inside in common areas &amp; people blast music until 6am, we didn't sleep at all. there was one female receptionist who was very nice &amp; helpful when we had such a horrible stay. we would never stay here again "
Brazil,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,10,6,6,i was worried about all bad reviews here. but i  haven't any problem there. staff was very friendly and wifi worked.    the only thing i didn't like was that you need to return before 4am or will be locked out till 8am   
England,Female,18-24,4,4,6,8,2,2,4,2,"no one was at reception when we arrived at 6:30 so we had to wait outside until 8am! very unwelcoming after a long flight! the communal area was very unclean, we were sat on the wifi and a rat came out from under the sofa! "
Australia,Male,31-40,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,we emailed to delay arrival time and called to confirm prior to arrival. we arrived they skimmed my credit card then told us that there were no beds. 9pm at night. we ended up having to go to the airport and sleeping on a chair as no other rooms were available. very slow and unhelpful. took an hour for them to prove the refund then realised they only partially refunded the amount and said it was because we were late even though they sold out beds to someone else. crooks. 
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,4.3,2,6,10,2,2,6,2,extremely rude staff and dirty hostel. they made us wait for over an hour to check in.
Canada,Female,31-40,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is right by venice beach, great location. that the only good thing i have to say about it though. some unhelpful staff, slow check in process, charged extra fees we weren't aware of, charged us $4 per night to pay by credit card, extreme dirty hostel (from dishes to walls, floor and furniture), rooms are super hot and loud with not even a working fan. it was a nightmare to sleep in. insanely expensive for what you get. worst hostel i've stayed in - and i've stayed in many. "
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,10,4,6,8,"great location! the room was clean, not too hot and with lockers inside the rooms and locks on the door. the only issues i had was hostility and one word/no eye-contact responses from some staff and although they advertise laundry, i was instructed to only use them after 10pm when staff had finished doing the sheets (then there was a sign on the closed doors saying no guest laundry after 10pm so no clue what that was about). the hostility brought down the vibe and it didn't feel very social "
Australia,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,10,4,4,6,4,"great location, staff member checking us in was quite rude and the facilities are quite run down. "
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,4,4,8,8,2,6,6,"extremely rude man at reception, haven't met someone so rude and i have been staying in hostels for 5 months, had to wait until 5 pm to check in when he earlier said 2 pm and when i approached him to ask for wi-fi he ignored me for  nearly a minute and then said in a horrible tone 'question' i asked if whilst i waited i could use wifi he rudely told me i have to wait until i check in to get the code. my room was way to hot to sleep, other staff where great, good waffles for breakfast. overpriced"
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,2,8,10,2,4,6,2,"i've stayed in hostels from bangkok to paris and this is the dirtiest. i was looking forward to my first hostel in the us, but this did not meet my expectations. very dirty common rooms and kitchen, and my shared room had windows that opened to the porch, so loud conversations were happening late into the night when myself and others were trying to get a little sleep.    location is awesome, right by the beach in the heart of venice.:)"
NewZealand,Male,31-40,7.7,8,6,10,6,6,8,10,"i booked a private room on the third floor (room 302). the room was practically a suite: very spacious.   sure the bed was wonky, no air con or tv, but the room had character. strangely enough the room had an old windows xp computer - no sure what for other than providing usb ports to charge devices (&amp; there's a disk drive too!).  the lobby, lounge and check-in are all very backpacker like - so don't be surprised.   this hostel fits well with the venice beach experience"
USA,Female,25-30,4.6,4,4,8,4,6,4,2,"this hostel was pretty disgusting, not really any security, on the more expensive side and so hot i couldn't sleep. i think people came and did a quick wipe down of the bathroom everyday but the place is a real dump. i don't think they have ac or windows in any of the rooms. "
Scotland,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,6,8,8,"let me start with location: fantastic! if it's your intention to stay in the venice/santa monica area i don't think there's anywhere better. you could throw a stone from this hostels balcony and hit venice beach.   the facilities were fine, on par with many hostels i've stayed in over the years. nothing special though.   only little qualm i had was with one of the members of staff. the other two i dealt with were great but one was just a bit brash and didn't appear to want to be there."
Switzerland,Female,25-30,5.7,4,6,8,4,8,6,4,"i booked a 7 female dorm, we were 10 women in there with a tiny bathroom. facilities are quite old.  staff is super friendly.  breakfast is coffee, one kind of cereal and waffles, not really a big choice!"
Australia,Couple,25-30,2.9,2,2,6,2,4,2,2,was absolutely horrible. nothing about it was good. i've travelled all over the world and this is by far the worst place. yes it's close to the beach but not worth it. don't stay here.
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,10,8,4,"it is great hostel to socialise someone.   location is the best thing in this hostel, it is near the main enterance to venice beach walk.   nice staff and great barbecue and socialization.   it might be noisy, but it is okay."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,4,8,8,6,"this hostel is all about the location, as close the the boardwalk as you can get. the building itself is rather old and has seen better days. everything needs a small repair of some sort as nothing is 100%. staff were friendly and competent and i had no dramas checking in, extending my stay or checking out. wi-fi was average at best. consider a short stay for this location and move to another location closer to other sights. this one is only really close to venice and sm ~30 to uber to hw for eg"
England,Male,41+,6,6,6,10,4,4,6,6,"location is fantastic, however, i felt the hostel staff rely on this for their business. i cou0le of the staff were great but that was offered by some being very rude, unhelpful &amp; obviously thought guests were an intrusion."
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,10,8,6,6,6,"my stay was very nice, i meet many nice people from different places and was able to foster a good experience.  breakfast was great, i got good sleep.  very close location to all the happenings.  staff was friendly and accommodating."
Ireland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic location, great staff and very reasonable price couldn't have been happier"
USA,Male,41+,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"room was great for 3 people to go private. not sure why they didn't oprnnkitchen until 8am. all common areas closed until 8am? weird, never saw anything like that before."
USA,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,room 201 the single bed is horrible and the street light shines in all night. might i suggest a better curtain. i had to tie my sarong over the blind there. and the cot bottom on the single makes the matress slide off.. but i like your staff and common area alot
Canada,Couple,18-24,3.1,4,2,8,2,2,2,2,"absolutely disgusting place.. everything was dirty, everyone is smoking indoors, the owner does not speak english, beds were not clean, wifi not working, kitchen horrifying, area is extremely sketchy. on our first morning a homeless man snuck in to the building and started yelling and they couldn't get him out. they charge a 25$ fee if you pay by card.... not impressed."
USA,Female,18-24,6,6,6,10,4,6,6,4,"just like everyone else says, this hostel is great for location...and nothing more beyond that. it looks pretty janky if you ask me. a lot of the furniture is worn out, dusty main area with the chairs all tore up. the bedrooms have this old dust odor to them, the bed sheets don't seem very clean (they don't have that nice clean smell either) but i will say the bathroom was not so bad. check in took too long. i had to wait for almost 30 min. no bueno.just see it more as a place to stay and gtfo. "
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,4,8,10,8,2,6,8,"great location but that is where the great stops. was pretty put off by some of the staff, they were not friendly nor could they offer any helpful advice about what to go and see. the dinner deals they adverse were non existent when i was there and the wifi only worked very infrequently. if you just want to be on the beach, it is a good spot though. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"it's an awesome place to be at, very chill. when there is fear of low security you kinda have to feel the atmosphere and know you'll be alright. everything went great in my stay. staff is very friendly and helpful. even the guests were very kind. this place is 2 min away from the shore. i loved it."
Italy,Female,18-24,4.9,4,4,10,2,6,6,2,"this was the dirties hostel i have ever been to. it was filthy and i would never stay there again. we used 2 packets of disinfectant wipes to get the room in reasonable shape. there was a hole in the wall, dead cockroaches and other insects, the shower had no pressure with very little water flowing, the bedsheets were full of holes and stains, one of the windows had no blinds or curtains, and plenty of dust on all surfaces. save your money and stay somewhere else - this was not worth it at all."
England,Couple,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,"very average. pretty dated now and a lot of the doors are broken and need replacing. it's pricy for what it is but a lot of hostels with a good location like this are these days. staff were nice and welcoming. i've stayed at the same sun more or less next door and i think i prefer that, but that's not that great either."
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had so much fun staying here  met some great people  staff were friendly   30 second walk from the beach  bars, convenience stores, restaurants all within a block  would deffo go back"
Wales,Couple,18-24,2.6,2,2,4,4,2,2,2,"don't stay here. all the bad reviews are correct!!! not in a safe location, anyone can walk in and out. the staff working there were awfully rude and scruffy - the man working there told us when we checked in 'i can see you, i'm on my lunch brake you'll have to wait'. it was all downhill from there. only good this about the hostel was lisa she was lovely. the wifi was also awful. we wanted to move hostel straight away. constantly smelt of weed. bad vibe. "
France,Female,25-30,6.6,6,4,10,8,8,6,4,"great location, nice breakfast... rooms smelt weird and wifi didn't work. it is expensive but same as everywhere in la. does the job if your there for a few days and want to be by the beach. "
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,10,8,8,amazing location!   helpful friendly staff.   would stay here again.
Australia,Male,31-40,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"horrible stay!  i read the negative reviews and decided i would still give this place a go.  terrible idea!  the only reason i have rated this place slightly alright is because of the location.  location feels very unsafe, although close to beach.  staff were terrible.  people doing drugs regularly in room.  place is filthy and run down.  anyone can walk into the hostel which makes it very unsafe.  i would never stay at this place again. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,6.9,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,"the staff were nice, la is expensive and this hostel is no exception. pretty good location right by venice beach."
France,Female,25-30,6.9,6,6,10,4,4,8,10,the location is the best thing.  the breakfast is okay  two major problems : staff is a little bit too rude and should be honest about the fact that there's no wifi  
Australia,Male,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,8,4,4,"worst hostel ive stayed in over my 6 month trip. no wi-fi, people smoking in the common area next to the kitchen, guests coming in and out of rooms at 3am, over priced dorms etc... only good thing was the breakfast. garbage !"
China,Female,25-30,5.7,6,4,8,6,8,4,4,总体地段很好，但是房间不够干净，沙发和公共地区都有味道，不推荐
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,8,6,10,4,8,4,4,feels a lot more shady than it is. fantastic location near the beach.
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,4,6,8,10,8,6,it was a place to stay and chill out for a bit.
CapeVerde,Female,18-24,5.1,2,6,10,2,8,6,2,"its a good location,good people.is just that the room smells bad, and the sheets didnt seem clean."
Netherlands,Male,41+,7.4,6,6,10,8,6,8,8,"great proximity to venice beach. generally good vibes. lovely common areas. awesome waffle breakfasts included. very clean.    one staff member can be quite unreasonable and rude with guests. i almost cancelled my stay upon arrival, as he was the first staff member i interacted with, and i witnessed him horribly harassing another guest right before my departure. this needs to be seriously addressed by mgmt."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,excellent 
Australia,Couple,31-40,5.1,2,6,10,2,8,6,2,"i understand it's a private room in la but man, it's expensive for what you get. either stay in a dorm to save money or find a hotel for a bit more. the room was awful, the bed was on an angle and the kitchen had nothing but a sink. no cups, no fridge, no nothing! it was so depressing!"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,10,6,i had a fantastic time when i was here with my dad! we met so many lovely people and ate delicious waffles every morning. i really don't like that people can smoke inside it just makes it really uncomfortable. the beds needed a bigger blanket as i was cold in the night. apart from that the vibe is great and it's right on the beach which is nice and chill. 
Namibia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a pleasant stay.the staff were very helpful.clean place .i love the fact that i only shared a bathroom with my roommates only and not the whole floor etc.  worth every dollar.
USA,Male,41+,5.1,2,8,10,2,8,4,2,this place is very dirty i would never stay there again 
Australia,Couple,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,conveniently located hostel right in the heart of venice. very pricey for what you get though - an average bunk and rooms that could do with a good clean. breakfast is basic and disappointing. good common areas. met some great travelers too
England,Couple,31-40,4.3,2,6,10,2,2,6,2,"this hostel is massively overpriced and really basic. we booked a private room and was greeted with a cockroach in the bathroom, my light didn't work and neither did the toilet. i complained the next day and they did fix the problems but offered me no compensation. these problems don't usually bother me but then we're  usually paying $25 a night and not $125.  location is great but that's it"
SouthKorea,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"superb location, feel at home, great breakfast.   become a new generation hippie.  엘에이 단골 숙소. 베니스비치를 만끽하면서 대중교통으로 다른 곳 가기도 편리함. 특히 혼자 여행사 여성전용 도미토리와 큰 공용키친은 큰 플러스.   "
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"location is perfect (was a bit hard to find at first, make sure you read directions given, wouldn't hurt to have a sign outside though..)   bathroom in 4 person dorm was so nice and newly renovated.   free breakfast is just a waffle but still good   would come back/ do recommend "
Germany,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved it! awesome!  mir hat das hostel gut gefallen. ich war in einem 7-bett-zimmer mit blick auf das venice sign. fand ich total geil. frühstück war ok. das beste: der strand ist gleich um die ecke. ich würde das hostel auf jeden fall weiterempfehlen. 
Israel,Male,25-30,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"i&amp;#39;ve stayed probably over 30 hostels in my life, and i&amp;#39;ve never had such a bad experience as this one.    the staff was very unfriendly. the room, bed, and shower were in a disgusting situation. at the room, there were only two lockers, when there are seven beds. and the wifi? don&amp;#39;t try to count on it, too slow and disconnect every few minutes.    whenever i tried to work things out and adjust the situation with the hostel stuff, i got a simple &amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s against our policy&amp;#34; answer, whi"
Australia,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location 50m from venice beach. they let me check in at 9am and have the free breakfast upon arrival which was really nice. free diner style coffee all day was also really nice too. one evening they had free hotdogs with pickles and onion and condiments supplied too. free dinner in an expensive ish country was pretty amazing really! $50us a night seems very expensive for a dorm bed but i don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;d get much cheaper in la anywhere and the location was great so can&amp;#39;t really complain!
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,10,6,8,10,"fantastic location, clean rooms and it was great that breakfast was included. my only complaint was the noise at night - both nights i was there people were running up and down the halls, yelling and slamming doors until very late. also be aware that if you pay your deposit on card, it take 5 business days to get your money back, which was problematic for me as i was leaving the u.s. in the next few days. the girl who checked me in also seemed very disinterested and wasn't very friendly. "
Sweden,Female,31-40,6,4,8,10,4,6,6,4,"i stayed in a four person female only room on the second floor. the room was not clean at all and it had a distinct smell of urine. i remember reading another review about the smell, but didn&amp;#39;t take it very serious. however, room 201 smells a lot!! when i booked the hostel it was written that all costs were included. however when i showed up taxes, resort fees, booking charge, holliday additiona cost was added to the price and what seemed like a good deal ended up really expensive. "
England,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,4,6,10,6,8,6,4,"this hostel served us a purpose, we wanted to stay near venice beach for a night. we decided my to stay any longer as we could get a really nice room on airbnb for less in a nice friendly neighbourhood. can't really comment on the social aspect and the staff were friendly and helpful however the hostel itself seemed run down and over priced for what it was"
England,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,6,8,6,4,"is a good cheap hostel with a close location to venice beach boardwalk. rooms are ok, common room and kitchen could do with some new furniture or updating. breakfast was limited -waffles were good though. hostel allows people to smoke inside which some guests didn&amp;#39;t like."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,amazing location! walking distance to everything 😊😊 very casual atmosphere!
England,Female,18-24,6.3,2,6,10,6,6,6,8,when i arrived the room hadn&amp;#39;t been cleaned. i informed the staff at reception i was simply given new sheets so i had to strip and make my own bed. the sink in the room didn&amp;#39;t drain and the toilet later stopped working. we had a whole night with no bathroom and was moved to a different room the next day. breakfasts are very unappealing and wifi is very dodgy which didn&amp;#39;t even work for half our stay. many of the staff are very rude and don&amp;#39;t seem to care however the location is incredible. 
HongKong,Female,18-24,6.6,8,4,10,6,8,6,4,"i mean, that's the only few places available at the beach area, so can't complain much.  great location, nice staff.    bathroom pipe was broken, every night the room is basically flooding...  the place is really sketchy, you got pot heads- which is normal lol  and drug abusing ladies who just jump into your conversation and laugh along for some reason. that creeps us out tbh.    but like i said, can't complain much cause you got no choice if you're on a budget travel like me :o "
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,2,8,10,4,8,4,4,"great location, staff was nice, hostel was clean but communial areas are in poor condition, most couches are severely ripped. coed dorm was 14 beds with 1 bathroom. "
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"my one and only complaint is that our ceiling fan squeaked pretty bad and it was really hot in the room other then that perfect! great staff, great rooms, great location. needless to say everything was great!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,hostel is in a great location right by the beach and has very helpful and friendly staff. the area is really interesting with a lot to see along the boardwalk. rooms are clean and good kitchen facilities and chill out areas. 
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,2,8,10,6,8,6,4,"arrived at hostel and was told my name wasn&amp;#39;t on the books so after panicking and asking over and over again if she could double check, the staff member finally looked again and it turns out i was! the photos definitely do this hostel justice, don&amp;#39;t expect it to be very nice. it was my first hostel and i&amp;#39;ve just come back from another stay in a hostel in san diego which was like a luxury hotel compared to this hostel. only good thing was the location, but i&amp;#39;d recommend staying in santa monic"
USA,Couple,18-24,6.9,4,10,8,10,6,6,4,"we had a private room. it was clean, tidy, nice, spacious! we had our own key, and our stuff was safe! they actually had room service here which i was surprised about, and they provided towels.  the location was pretty nice being right next to the beach, although there were a lot of homeless people around at night. this is definitely a hostel for you to stay at with someone else or a group of people.  the staff was kind of helpful, but some were unclear and sarcastic which is not good."
USA,Male,18-24,4.6,4,4,8,6,2,4,4,"the staff took forever to check me in and out and needed a lot of reminding, the room wasn't clean and nothing seemed well-run or organized. definitely not worth the rates they charged. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,6,8,the venice beach hostel is greatly located right next to the beach. the price is great for a us hostel. it is very clean and well maintained. the breakfast (which is included) could have been a bit better and more diverse. otherwise it was an enjoyable stay. 
Sweden,Male,31-40,5.1,4,6,6,4,8,6,2,the area didn&amp;#39;t feel very safe in the evening and the room where we stayed had a strong smell to urine. in my next trip to la i will not repeat at this hostel.
Finland,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,a lot of the residents are staff living there. they are pretty friendly. breakfast is waffles and potatoes. as a location venice beach is okay during day time buy very scary after dark. lots of surfers and skaters and also weed smokers.
Austria,Male,31-40,5.7,2,6,6,6,6,10,4,"for two nights dormitory the booked 135,- from my visa instead of 2x48,00- --- i call that a classic tried-fraud!!!! i will take the legal way on them now..."
USA,Couple,25-30,7.1,6,6,10,6,10,6,6,"amazing location! right on the main road within venice beach area.   however, this also meant a very noisy room for us, and i wasn't completely impressed with the security of the hostel, as the front door was left open with anyone free to come and go as they please.   room had a strange smell, and felt very old and in need of some revamping, but was all in all clean.   breakfast was nice, but as far as the hostel goes for what it was, the room was pricey, and i probably wouldn't stay here again."
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"omg, had an amazing time.  everyone was so helpful ana friendly.  much thanks to the staff and those who were passing through.  peace"
NewZealand,Couple,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"awesome stay,  fabulous location,  really helpful staff :)"
Taiwan,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really enjoyed my stay there. it was great! the staff was friendly and helpful and i even made some friends there. i will definitely go back there if i had another chance.
Belgium,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,6,10,6,6,the rooms were very cold!
England,Female,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,6,6,8,"the staff could be friendlier, not the best hostel i've stayed in by a long shot but the beds were comfy and the location is ideal. warning: if you're planning on being/ going out between 5-8am you will be locked out! not 24 hour currently and dinner was also not included as advertised."
Sweden,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"very nice staff 99 %, nice chilled out areas to cook and hang out, feels like being in someones living room..very relaxed. a bit funny though to have to be out of the room between 11am and 3pm for cleaning....its a long time not being able to be in your space if you wanted to. i would definately come back if i was in la again!"
USA,Female,41+,6,6,4,8,6,6,6,6,"i loved location close to the action on the beach. great room mates from ireland made it interesting. there is a large common room that had most kitchen needs, and couches with places to charge your tech. the front desk wasn't always covered, you may have to wait for answers to questions. great hostel to stay at for fun outside...not so much for a good night sleep. street sounds definitely come in the room! parking is tough, watch out for tickets! many homeless..and we saw a car window busted."
Brazil,Female,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,6,4,4,6,"the hostel have a excellent localization, good acomodation, but the staff is not that good, watting for check in, rude people."
Romania,Female,25-30,6.3,6,10,10,2,6,6,4,"check in was slow and unless we put up a fight, we would have been charged a higher price for the room than initially agreed (excluding tax). the first time we used the toilet, there was leakage - however, it did not happen afterwards. the furniture is very old and run down, the shower is inconvenient and water was barely dropping.  the place is too run down to even be hippie. location is very good, but i wouldn't go back there - not enough value for the money it's charging."
England,Female,18-24,5.1,6,2,10,4,4,4,6,"anyone could walk in and out of this hostel, it seemed people lived there, luckily we were in a private room for security but i wouldn't have liked to have leave my stuff in a locker which was in the hallway. breakfast was awful with just a waffle maker, and potatoes? we moved around the corner to samesun venice beach and had a great time."
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff (lovely greetings to sarah and simon) is so nice, it's very clean and the location is perfect.  "
Canada,Male,25-30,3.7,2,6,8,2,2,4,2,"i have traveled all around the world and have been in many different hostels as well as worked in them. i instantly got bad vibes from this hostel when me and my girlfriend walked in. the staff was very rude, unhelpful, messed other people's reservations up, and were drunk. the facility's, common areas, and kitchen were filthy. people were allowed to smoke inside and the outside patio are is right next to rooms so you get smoke and noise from that. on top of all this it was extremely over priced"
Chile,Male,31-40,8.9,6,8,10,10,10,10,8,"location was amazing, the atmosphere was nice, it was clean enough, expensive for what you get (but location is something you're also paying for in the total). i'm easygoing and my expectations were medium-low, so i was extremely happy with what i found and the overall stay. the staff was amazing. the boys and girls that work there were -altogether- a sort of dysfunctional family, which was kind of  funny. sarah rules above all."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,4,10,good spot. but very boring hostel not much going on
Canada,Male,18-24,8,6,10,10,8,8,8,6,very spacious provate double room and bathroom. i fecommend this place
France,Female,18-24,4.6,4,6,10,4,2,4,2,"the location is the only good thing about this hostel. it wasn't very clean, and the staff members are weird...  i stayed there for 2 days in a room with 10 other people for a 7 bed shared-room and it was okay..."
England,Male,31-40,3.1,2,4,6,2,2,2,4,warning: do not stay at this hostel. the positive reviews on this website here are questionable. the management treat guests like dirt. they charge an exorbitant security deposit and make you jump through hoops to get it back the next day. i would never stay here again. this hostel and its management totally ruined the atmosphere of what is a nice town on the beach.
USA,Female,41+,7.7,6,6,10,8,8,8,8,cordial and helpful staff. our room was clean and cozy - with modern bathroom fixtures. the best part was the easy five minute walk to the beach and great eateries.
Germany,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,8,10,wonderful staff and beautiful room! it was huuuge and the beds were soo comfortable!! i loved staying here and i'll be back soon!!
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"venice beach hostel was a charming, wonderfully situated hostel. the two staff members that i met we knowledgeable and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable. overall it was a very enjoyable stay that i would recommend to anyone looking to visit the area."
Spain,Female,18-24,4.9,2,8,8,2,8,4,2,the organization is very poor. i changed room twice in three days. the first room in wich i stayed was literally a box without window and three people in there. and i was actually paying the same that people in pretty nice rooms. the breakfast is really bad too. i wouldn't come back to venice beach hostel and i wouldn't recommend it either. however once i complained there were a person of the staff that helped me after arguing with me for a while.
Australia,Female,18-24,6.3,8,8,6,6,4,6,6,simon was extremely accommodating when we checked in 27/7. when we checked out on 28/7 the new man was extremely rude. he acted as if we were the most inconvenient thing about his morning. we just stood there in such an awkward situation as he bustled about getting our security deposit back and being very rude when we needed to put our bags in storage. he spoke in single words! for example 'sign'. 'no'. he actually ruined the whole experience and we were so off-put by his absolute hostility.
England,MixedGroup,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,6,8,8,"pros: couldn't ask for a better location in venice 2 min walk to the beach front. room/beds comfortable. clean bathrooms/showers. free wifi that works well. lots of evening activities, breakfast included. most staff friendly.  cons: $100 deposit required when you check in plus sneaky $25 surcharge if you book only one night on a weekend, hidden in the small print. check in process is a shambles when busy, then one staff member was pretty rude. maybe upset he had to get his arse off the couch. "
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,i loved the feel and location of the hostel! it seems very venice beach and i would recommend to friends
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great hostel. excellent location. private room with enquire was huge and very comfortable and quiet.
Australia,Female,18-24,4.9,6,2,10,4,4,4,4,"the hostel was probably one of the worst we stayed at. we enjoyed our stay but the facilities are awful and the room very basic and stuffy. the location is amazing though!! right along the beach and a nice walk into santa monica. there are heaps of awesome restaurants and cafes at your doorstep. we really enjoyed our 10 days there. we didn't spend much time at the hostel, because it was so much fun being outside so it didn't really matter that the accommodation wasn't the greatest "
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"pretty standard hostel but an amazing location, less than 5 minutes to venice beach, with a nice pub and coffee shop nearby. the twin room was quite comfortable and spacious, and they let us check in early which was very much appreciated after a 14 hour flight."
USA,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,everyone on staff is nice except the european white guy who seems to be in charge... he is miserable with his life apparently and is a real debbie downer. stay away from him 
Sweden,Male,25-30,8.3,6,6,10,8,10,10,8,"awesome staff and great atmosphere there is always someone to talk to and things todo. 300m from muscle beach, just go and hit the outdoor gym!"
Chile,Male,18-24,4.6,4,6,10,2,4,4,2,"to dirty, and personal was very cold. they didint control what happen inside the rooms even if there where a party!! its ok for young travelers but thats it, just ok."
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,8,10,"the staff we very helpful and extremely friendly. the location is great for the beach and santa monica but be prepared for long bus trips to hollywood, downtown, or universal city. (we found that catching the bus to the closest metro stop cut down travel time)."
Germany,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,good hostel !!right next to the beach :) 
Brazil,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"lockers in horrible condition, staff not very polite, beds were not clean when we arrived, and the price is ridiculous for that kind of service."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,6,6,8,6,"people are friendly and nice, however, i didn't like the hidden extra fees at checkout. right near the beach and cafe's. also you get a discount at the bike rentals for staying at the hostel which helps with funds."
Germany,Male,18-24,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,when i came from australia i was shocked how expensive this hostel is.  but obviously this is quite normal in la.  i really liked the atmosphere in the hostel and the stuff is awesome! the location is top and even if your don't have car you can do a lot of things.  so would definitely recommend it and next time i'll stay here again   and they got free breakfast with waffles and eggs in the morning which is great!  
Australia,Couple,41+,8.3,8,10,10,8,6,8,8,had a private room with a double bed. ...super fast internet! the bed was average but good enough.  an electronic safe for belongings in the room.  i would definitely stay here again. 
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"superb location- right to the beach and center of venice activities. hostel itself is a little bit pricy but economical : nice bathroom in the room and spacious room and common areas, free wifi and computers, free breakfast including tasty waffle, oatmeal, eggs and bread, potato dish and coffee, free rental body board etc. full kitchen and self cook/clean rule. the staff were friendly. main door was locked over night and good security. i will definitely stay again if i visit la"
England,Couple,18-24,4.9,4,6,10,4,4,2,4,"run down hostel needs a major revamp  no young staff members   no activities expect a morning run  witnessesed a cleaning member drinking budweiser at breakfast    cleaning staff signed the sheet to say they had emptied the bin when they hadn't, the sheet says to check for bulbs out well they didn't as there was one missing our whole stay    good location and that's about it   we liked venice so much we checked into ssun and it was a much better vibe and atmosphere down the road"
Romania,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"if you're seeking for the ocean, this is the best place. still, combined bus and subway, you can reach downtown in 90 minutes. safe area and safe hostel, not as dangerous as people say. the promenade is o street away with people having fun. good breakfast and cleans rooms."
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,4,10,10,6,10,6,8,this hostel is located very close to the beach and all the crazy characters on the boardwalk.
Belgium,Male,25-30,3.4,2,4,4,4,2,6,2,"dirty facilities, very poor service. we booked this hostel &amp; were afterwards contacted with the message that we would have to pay for an extra night. after sending 3 mails asking for an explanation, no-one answered.   when we got there, it was even more expensive than mentioned + the separate room we had booked, was not available. staff tried to help, but was unable to, seemingly because of intoxication.  breakfast was nice, however; make-it-yourself waffles were tasty, but that's it."
England,Male,18-24,5.1,4,4,8,6,2,6,6,"one particularly aggressive staff member confronted me after he assumed that i used some of his special milk. he refused to listen to the fact that the milk was already out on the side, and maintained that i opened the forbidden fridge to use his milk. there was no other milk available to hostel guests, which was unsatisfactory.    when checking out in the morning, no-one was present at the ""24 hour"" reception to return our deposit, so we had to wait for our deposit to be returned.    overpriced."
England,Female,18-24,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,6,6,could not stay the first night even though was booked previously as told there was no room! manager didn't seem to care and offered no help in finding alternative accommodation (other staff were friendly and helpful which is why i marked them more). breakfast was poor and dinner was non-existent even though advertised on several sites! key didn't work on bedroom and no activities arranged/offered day or night. 
Australia,Female,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,"absolutely awesome location - right near the beach. little bit of street noise, but that's to be expected. had no probs sleeping though. stayed in a private room &amp; it was much cheaper than getting a hotel in the area. the place is a little shabby but has good character. excellent breakfast included."
England,Female,18-24,5.4,4,6,8,6,4,6,4,"staff weren't very friendly/helpful. room was pretty dirty - lots of rubbish under the bed. very noisy at night due to traffic and bars outside. good location, very close to the beach. "
Poland,Male,25-30,8.3,10,6,10,6,10,6,10,good location (just next to the venice beach; relatively short taxi ride to la international airport). facilities seem old but work.
Australia,Female,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,6,8,6,"my friend and i had an overall good stay. there a were a few problems. first of all we were put into a staff room and not a dorm as i had booked from a few weeks in advance. when i enquired, one of the female staff more or less said that they don't want guests in their room either, which is fair enough. the manager was rude and told me it wasn't his fault i can't read the fine print which says they can put guests in any type of share room. also slow with check-in, we waited 2 hours. "
Canada,Female,18-24,3.7,2,4,6,6,2,2,4,the man working the front desk was horrifically rude after firstly emailing me that they can no longer accommodate me.  i then called to figure out what was going on and then the rude guy wouldn't answer any questions. later then found out that my bed wasn't cancelled and had not had my money refunded. stayed at hermosa beach and definitely will be going back to that hostel again and not giving money to rude individuals. 
England,Female,18-24,5.4,6,4,2,6,6,6,8,the location of venice beach hostel is not safe and appeared to be frightening of a night time and sometimes of a day time which i think is important for people to know before booking the hostel. 
Germany,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,we had a great stay at the venice beach hostel. the room was clean and well equipped. the staff was always kind and helpfull and the location of the hostel is wonderful. everything was perfect!!
Wales,Female,18-24,5.1,4,8,10,4,2,4,4,most staff were very rude but one or two were actually helpful.  looks like it's falling apart and there's an additional charge for most things within the hostel. but it's i a great location and i met some nice people here.  enjoyed the stay but wouldn't recommend or return there. 
Australia,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,do not stay at this hostel! staff were rude and didn't want to know you at all. dorms were crammed full of beds with nowhere to put your bag. my bed was in the hallway of 1 of the rooms where the light stayed on all night and was a thoroughfare for other guests. very overpriced. i've stayed in hostels all through europe and south america and this was by far the worst!!!!!
England,Couple,18-24,3.7,2,2,8,4,2,4,4,try not to stay here! 
England,Female,31-40,6.3,4,6,8,6,6,6,8,mostly fine but there is one abrupt and quite rude staff member who made me feel like i was an inconvenience by being there at all. made me feel the atmosphere was not as great as it could be because of his abrupt manner.
Italy,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,staff doesn't understand your needs and doesn't accept any comment. they try everything to steal your money if you want to cancel a reservation. the don't answer you when you write to cancel a reservation so that they can have your money
Australia,Male,18-24,7.4,6,10,10,6,6,4,10,pretty boring and very expensive for a hostel ... but great location 
England,Female,18-24,5.7,2,6,10,6,4,6,6,"very unhelpful staff , takes over an hour to check you in ! also the tax they add is ridiculously high ! not value for money as it's a very basic hostel with bad staff ! "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great rooms, great atmosphere, and a great breakfast."
Germany,Male,18-24,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"we arrived back at the hostel after a night out and found our stuff in the middle of the room! we have been told by the staff to immediately change our room (in the middle of the night, without prior notice!)"
France,Male,41+,6.6,6,6,10,6,6,8,4,the hostel location at venice beach is great. so very close to the beach in the heart of this fancy location.  having the possibility to cook ourselves especially at breakfast is a real plus.  however the cleanliness is not sufficient. the bathrooms would need to be entirely refurbished.the floor carpetting is doubtfull. too bad that this lack of care of the place reduces the plaisure of a cool and friendly laid back atmosphere that fits well with the surf/skate/beach genes of this vacation town.
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,excellent staff! the brazilian guys and matt are amazing people! i can't wait to come back!
NewZealand,Male,25-30,4.9,2,4,10,2,4,8,4,"although venice beach hostel is in a great location, it is by far one of the worst hostels i've stayed at and there are 2 reasons for this. poor staff and poor facilities. everything is very run down.. you get the vibe that the owners don't care about the property at all. i booked a 7 bed dorm but got put into a 13 bed dorm. most staff have a negative attitude towards people. if you want to be in a more welcoming hostel that is a lot better value for money, choose samesun."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,8,6,"staff were very friendly lots of advice for food, taxis etc. relaxed and friendly vibe not roust which was good for us. quite a large room was nice. location was excellent! "
Ethiopia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,keep it up! a little work for guests to keep the rooms cleaner.
Brazil,Female,31-40,7.1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,"hostel is well located and clean, but the lady at the reception was absolutely impolite."
Spain,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,10,6,"such a nice hostel for a short period of time. the room was pretty nice, except for the bathroom. it was quite dirty, although that depends on the other girls you're staying with. also, a bou it dissappointed with breakfast. although you can eat as much as you want, there's very little to choose from, so i would recommend go get some cereal or milk at the closest market.  all in all, everything was good, you get to meet a lot of people from everywhere and it's right in venice beach!"
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,4,8,10,8,6,8,8,hostel is in a great location and is kept clean with good cooking facilities. at the time of booking it was advertised that evening meals were offered for $1 a night however when we arrived we were told that they weren't offering these meals without an apology! there was also a huge tax added to the price which wasn't made clear when booking of about 25%! definitely not worth the money unfortunately. 
England,MixedGroup,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,8,6,"overall the hostel was in a really good location, right on the beach. it had a chilled out atmosphere and the staff were nice "
Australia,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"a nice hostel, only 2 minute walk from the beach. rooms were basic but clean, wifi was good, staff were very friendly and helpful. pool table, tv with netflix, computers with internet, sport balls, kitchen, lounge all available for use  .plenty of pubs nearby and supermarket a 1 minute walk. would definitely recommend this hostel."
Japan,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,thus is a nice hostel!
Canada,Female,31-40,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,"the location of this hostel is amazing and super convenient, close to the beach, bike rental places, a few pubs, plus an excellent cafe across the street and mexican joint right downstairs. the staff was friendly and made good suggestions, plus breakfast and dinner included was a bonus, and yummy too. despite these things, i would say the hostel was average - not quite worth the price, but i would consider staying there again, for location and dinner being included."
England,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"had a great stay here! would definitely come back! awesome time, great people."
Australia,Female,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,we really enjoyed our stay. my second visit now. location is excellent. but ...arghhh...those stairs..difficult for me but very greatful to the kind staff that helped
Sweden,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"this was without a doubt the best hostel i´ve stayed at! the staff, the atmosphere, the location, the room (private room, ensuite!!)...everything was just great! if you´re looking for a hotel, don´t go to vbh. but if you´re looking for nice people to talk to, helpful staff, value for your money, well, stay here. i am definately coming back!"
Brazil,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,10,4,4,4,2,"this hostel is well located in the heart of venice beach. but that it all it has to offer. at a price that could get you a cheap hotel, this hostel is falling appart. everything seems dirty and old, the kitchen and common rooms are terrible. the private bed we stayed was just ok, at least it had a bathroom ensuite.  would not recomend this one."
Australia,Couple,25-30,6,4,8,8,6,6,4,6,"not a great hostel, but in a good location for venice beach.  rooms are a bit average, nothing worth talking about. breakfast was good, with waffles.  wifi a bit dodgy too.    prob wouldn't stay here again, but an okay place."
Germany,MixedGroup,31-40,7.7,6,6,10,8,10,8,6,"los angeles is large!!! so if u want to stay close to the beach, this might be a perfect choise. otherwise, quiet far away from hollywood for example..."
Netherlands,Male,25-30,6.9,4,6,8,6,8,10,6,"nice hostel, good location. but 42 dollars is way too much for a normal 14 bed dorm."
Australia,Female,25-30,6,6,6,10,6,6,6,2,very unclean was in a good location  
Canada,Female,25-30,6,6,8,10,4,4,6,4,"traveling can often be expensive, so budgeting was key for the group i went with.  we were pleased to stay at a below average place for the right price, however we attempted to stay an additional night based on the prime location but ended up checking out early due to the incredible disrespect the owner showed when we confronted him regarding a price that was quote by his staff and then over charged. i would not recomment staying here but at the same sun with a beach front view and great vibe."
Russia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,6,10,10,8,8,8,nice location. i was able to see the ocean from my double-bed room and it's very important for me coz i live too far away from it) free breakfast is also the good thing. i think that's the best hostel at that hood for this price. i've been back to la in a week since i left this place and i had to found a place to stay again but there was no vacation in here. however i've found the hostel with the same price and it was much worse in spite of it was really closer to the ocean on the same street..
Australia,Male,41+,7.1,4,6,8,8,10,8,6,staff very helpful. overpriced. free food once you know about it.  smokers abound unfortunately. as a backpacker ok.
Argentina,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,"staff, atmosphere and location were awesome! strongly recommended. joaquín. argentina"
Germany,Couple,25-30,6.6,2,10,8,4,8,6,8,"this hostel definetly needs to be renovated. the common rooms and the kitchen are fine, but our room was just an assortment of furnitures which deserves to go to the garbage. also the cleanliness was good, we didn't felt comfy in our room, as everything in there was worn out and setted up without concept. the room would be ok for max. half of the price we paided. everything else (breakfast, location (if you like venice), staff,...) is good, but please work on the look of your rooms and hallways."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,nice place close to the beach and good to get some free food included. it attracts some weird people but i guess that's not the hostels fault.
Switzerland,Male,25-30,8.6,10,10,8,10,6,8,8,"very pleasant stay, super location next to venice beach. enjoyed the stay a lot. value-for-price is fantastic! recommend a stay, for sure!"
England,MixedGroup,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,6,8,6,4,"i loved the location, but it could have done with being cleaner! i have contacted the hostel twice now, because i paid $100 deposit on arrival (which i was not told i would have to do) and i have still not been reimbursed. as you can imagine, this is really frustrating. they are not replying to my emails and i am going to have to make an expensive call to the usa about it."
Poland,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,i really enjoyed the stay in venice. i stayed there 3 nights and had no problem booking or cancelling extra night.  staff was super friendly and i know that it's hard to find in a hostel. was also clean. well wasn't luxurious and prob was too expensive for the quality but i guess it's the location you pay for. i would definitely come back! 
Scotland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,the building could do with being refurbished but apart from that was a very good hostel.
Australia,Couple,18-24,5.7,2,8,8,6,8,4,4,"very close to venice beach, however the area felt a bit dodgy at night. rooms smelt funny, but were clean. free breakfast was limited."
Italy,Male,31-40,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"i wad in usa for business and for the first time i decided to book a hostel instead of a hotel. i really enjoyed my time, met a lot of new people, very nice atmosphere and perfect location because you don't need to move in other places, neither for nightlife! "
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,6,10,8,8,10,6,"i didn't stay here too long but what i saw seemed really good. the bed was comfy and the staff were nice. it's definitely the place to go for atmosphere, maybe less so if you are looking for shiny and clean."
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,it was a nice hostel. they ha free dinner every night and we ate some bean mix which was very good. 
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,"like all the best hostels, a bit shabby and cosy.you can smoke in the common rooms which i thought was going to be disgusting but was actually fine. lots of plants and books. two private bathrooms in my 16bed dorm. kitchen is a little run down but has everything you need. free dinner is great, saved money but the breakfast is just waffles you make yourself, would be nice to have some bread at least! only old computers i didnt try but didnt look up to much, and bad wifi connection. right on beach"
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,8,6,"i really enjoyed my stay at the vbh! staff was friendly and helpfull, the rooms where all right and lots of cool other travellers to do some tours or just walk 3 min to hang at the beautifull beach. "
NewZealand,Couple,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"this hostel is in a great location if you are wanting to be in the heart of venice beach. not so good if you are wanting to see other attractions such as hollywood, universal studios, magic mountain etc as it can take 1 n a half to 2 n a half hours via public transport.  venice beach is a great spot to chill out though, and explore the boardwalk up to santa monica. our private couple room was perfect, clean, lots of space. the staff are okay. the smoking in the common room is disgusting."
England,Male,31-40,5.4,4,6,10,4,4,6,4,miserable staff. expensive dorm rooms which are not particularly clean. the only plus is that venice beach is just one block away.
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"defiantly returning great hostel, great location, friendly staff, great atmosphere overall great stay  thank you"
Australia,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,i appreciated the free dinner. not a bad place to stay
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great hostel, really enjoyed my stay, i'm going to try to come back!"
England,Female,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,6,10,10,4,you cant get a better location for venice beach than this hostel... rooms and cleanliness left a little to be desired... but its very fitting for the chabby chic feel that venice is all about.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"third time staying here, this place has so much character and venice beach is such a unique part of l.a. i would not stay anywhere else. the staff is really helpful and the hostel does a descent enough breakfast and an okay dinner which is better than nothing."
Japan,Female,25-30,5.1,2,6,6,4,4,8,6,"we have booked twin beds private room, but the room was four beds dorm. though other guests were not there, the facilities in the room was lower than expected. in the bathroom drain was broken and dirty water was running up.  second day we asked to change the room and once they said yes, but some miscommunication between morning staff and night staff, we were made to stay same room again. was terrible.  staffs were really friendly and helpful, but owner seems not able to manage the things."
Netherlands,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"do not expect too much from dinner (which was only spaghetti with sauce and the next day rice with beans). breakfast was good, with waffles/pancake and bread with egg.  perfect location if you like the beach, and sports. a lot of different nationalities where in the hostel, so you never lonely when you come by yourself.   you could also work at the hostel as part time for part of the stay. so the staff here where very kind and friendly (except the owner himself)."
Canada,Couple,18-24,7.7,4,8,10,8,8,6,10,"stay at this hostel if you don't mind paying $40 a night to be a block away from the beach and for free breakfast and supper. do not expect anything else. wifi only worked in the kitchen and common rooms. our computer in our room wouldn't turn on and the staff didn't seem to care. the shower head sucked, took my whole shower to warm up, and by that time the floor of the shower was flooded as the drain was clogged. they're super strict on their rules. good coffee, i'll give them that. "
Germany,Female,31-40,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,its a bit run down but so is the rest of venice. i liked the effort with the dinner they prepare for you. best thing: its about a 3 min walk to the beach.
Sweden,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel, very good location. you can save money on food, since breakfast and dinner is included. however it is the same everyday so you might get bored  if you stay for a long time. breakfast is waffles and pancakes.   great place to meet people! nice common room and a terrace on the roof.   shower and toilet in our room as well. i would definitely stay there again."
Switzerland,Couple,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,8,8,6,6,"regular hostel, fair prices based on the truly awesome location. 5min walk to the beach. friendlyness of the staff couldn't more variate. from mean useless a§§ motherfu*ers to really beatiful helpful great people, depends who you get. balcony is awesome, chill in the shade, watch the venice wierdos down the street and the pacific at the same time. liquor store is just one block away and endless restaurants, weed doctors and bars within 2 min walkin distance. we'd come again in a heartbeat.."
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,10,8,"loved the hostel, but i don't think smoking should be permitted inside. did not like that at all."
Poland,Male,25-30,4.6,4,6,8,2,6,4,2,"the building needs some repairs and rooms are simply dirty (or at least mine was dirty).  there was a safe in the room, but it was blocked when i arrived, so the manager opened it by screwdriver (btw, i did not feel secure, storing my valuables in a safe that can be opened like that). the only really strong point of the property is its location - few steps from the beach and there is a bus stop nearby, so one can easily reach the downtown (although it is a long ride)."
Russia,Male,31-40,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,4,"all though, the location is great, the place is really old, would rather pay a little more and stay in the hostels next door. stayed in the private two bed room, the rooms are big, but bathroom is old, and rooms are old. the people staying there were nice. the staff was helpful, a bit unorganized though."
Italy,Couple,18-24,4.9,2,4,10,2,4,6,6,"the wifi connection is horrendous and only sometimes works outside in the corridor. the place needs a massive refurbishment, it is very old and dull, it is an absolute dive. the bed was the most uncomfortable bed in the world, it was so bad that you could feel the springs. although it says dinner and breakfast included  you only get waffles or rice and pasta not a proper meal. the staff barely new the area and were very sarcastic and unhelpful. the only plus is it is right next to the beach. wnr"
Spain,Couple,25-30,5.7,2,8,10,6,4,6,4,"very old building. they don't give you dinner, but pasta for you to cook. expensive"
USA,Couple,25-30,7.4,6,6,10,8,6,8,8,"the breakfast, private room size, and location were all fantastic!"
Australia,Male,18-24,5.4,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,venice beach is one for the hippies
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,4,6,10,6,6,"it was great to be greeted by carl, he was super nice. nice staff. hard to find the actual hostel, no easily visible sign. june gloom set in for our stay there so it was never very nice looking outside. great little cafe across the street and bars around the place. very close to venice beach and santa monica pier is 45min walk away. very far away from hollywood and usual touristy activities. traffic is always gross. hire a car."
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location.. 1 minute to the beach.. though it is a fairly expensive cab ride to hollywood.. staff were great except for 1 guy that i found a bit rude.. good common area and they provide everything to make breakfast and dinner which was good! 
Norway,Female,25-30,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,really liked that you could make your own breakfast &amp; that dinner was included too!
Australia,Male,25-30,4.9,2,8,10,2,2,4,6,"owner treats you like a piece of money, an shouldn't work in a hostel. the fact his miserable face is there daily made an average stay. i don't normaly make reviews but the effort here was necessary...... stay around the corner!"
France,Couple,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"excellent staff at the reception. very friendly and helpful. however, when we made our booking we received unprofessional and rude emails from mark about advanced payments.  wifi was up and down. great breakfast and dinners. even if the room was cleaned every days, there was a strong smell. excellent location, right by the beach."
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,10,6,10,6,6,6,6,if you want the cheapest stress free experience at the beach this is the right place. the price is good and their is free food for dinner and breakfast ( i should say that it is included).all meals were vegetarian. there is free parking within walking distance.  the hostel is in a slightly run down section of venice beach but there is still places to go for a drink or some lunch and it is super close to very nice places if you want to walk around or splurge on some good food.
Brazil,Couple,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice place, nice crew =)"
Australia,Female,31-40,8.9,10,6,10,10,8,8,10,the bed in my room was very uncomfy but my room was beautiful. i had a view of the ocean and afternoon sunshine. i would have been happy to live there! free food was an awesome addition.
Australia,Male,41+,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,good place room was clean nice and friendly staff good location if you want to see venice too faraway for la centre
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i always like to stay in venice beach when i am in la, and this hostel the best location for that. the staff are good they do a nice breakfast and the dorm rooms even have there own bathrooms. they had a karaoke night on while i was there which was good fun. this hostel has great character."
Australia,Couple,25-30,5.1,4,6,10,6,2,2,6,"where do i start... upon arrival they tried to charge us for a night we had cancelled weeks before, staff were rude and unfriendly and it became apparent that their hostile attitudes were due to poor management who seemed to want to take advantage of young travellers.  we were treated like scum, told very rudely that you could only have 1 egg or waffles, not both. in the common area, no one spoke, it was as if the staff/ managements attitudes had rubbed off. worst hostel i have ever stayed in."
Poland,Couple,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"great localization- only 3 min from venice beach, nice resto near (mao’s resto recommended), surf and bike rentals just in the corner, small shops also.  we stayed in privet room- it was big, we actually had 4 rooms :)small closet; small room with sink, table, window; bathroom and  bedroom. it was clean and had everything we needed.  nice personnel, nice common areas –though we did not actually use it. one remark – be early at the breakfast:). i recommend this hostel and would return there."
England,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i really liked it here. friendly staff and great location. i booked a single room and got a huge private room with 2 double beds and private bathroom. wifi was free and generally worked ok, although i couldn`t get a signal in my room. i was disappointed that all of the common areas closed between 3am and 8am (i was jet-lagged and awake most of the night) but the receptionist gave me an extra 30 mins to finish my skype call which was good. will definitely stay again on my way back through la."
England,Female,31-40,5.1,4,4,8,4,4,6,6,"the hostel itself is pretty average, nothing special at all. the location is good though, literally steps from the beach and just a few blocks to the bars and restaurants. i didn't like the guys on reception, carl, in particular was quite rude and seemd annoyed at having to make extra waffle mix at 10.15am  even though breaky is served until 10.30am. terrible luggage storage system, anyone could take your stuff."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,we had a great time! felt like a classy hotel for real cheap!!
England,Male,25-30,5.4,8,8,6,4,4,4,4,"not the best - i'm not precious but it's be nice if you get what you paid for which i didn't feel we did. the ""computers in rooms"" thing is not entirely accurate (when i mentioned this to a fellow guest she laughed and basically said that they put that there to get bookings!).    on returning from a night out, the common area looked like a wake was taking place. do yourself a favour and pay an extra few bucks a night, get a hotel in santa monica or similar and give this place a miss."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,8,10,10,"i loved this place! it is in an awesome location, very close to the beach. the rooms are nice, the staff are helpful and the facilities, wifi etc are good. free breakfast and dinner is good. will be back for sure :) thank you."
USA,Couple,25-30,6.6,6,8,10,6,6,6,4,"although it was a memorable experience, i would prefer a more mature crowd. many people were talking about getting high and drinking....lame. i liked being able to walk downstairs right to the beach, and the kitchen was big too. if you like to smoke, this is the place for you, because they allow that indoors."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,6,8,8,4,4,4,4,the guy at reception was very rude. and i shared a room with 9 other girls so showering was an issues. i wasn't told if there was other shared bathrooms. i actually only ended up staying 1 night and going to a different hostel. price wasn't even that reasonable considering. 
Australia,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,i took a private room which was still a very good deal. not flash but all mod-coms available and a good size. a basic dinner and breakfast is included or you can cook your own. you could be very social here or just do your own thing. 1 hour by very cheap bus to all main attractions is ok with me.
Spain,Female,41+,6.6,4,6,10,6,8,8,4,"the atmosphere of the hostel is very nice, but the building needs to be renew and get better"
Switzerland,Couple,18-24,6.3,8,6,4,8,6,6,6,smoking near the eating area is allowed in vbh - which is not a good idea.
Australia,Couple,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"perfect location! amazing staff! huge rooms! free breakfast! 2 extra large gathering areas, big kitchen.. how can you go wrong? i can't recommend this place highly enough, absolutely loved it!"
Australia,Male,41+,8.3,8,10,8,8,10,8,6,"we were a little concerned about cleanliness in the hostel when we arrived, and also about safety in the area.  the hostel is quite old and run-down, and needs some general building maintenance. however, the price was very good, and the location excellent, only a few hundred yards from the beach. we had a beach view out of one window.  our room was clean and well prepared for us.  the staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, and reassured us about safety.  we would happily stay again."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"good hostel, great location, breakfast and dinners great idea and very helpful but the smoking inside the common rooms is disgusting and not fair on non smokers, it forced us to stay in our room instead of being able to kick back and relax on the couches"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay, helpful staff and a lot of character!"
Italy,Male,31-40,7.1,4,8,10,10,4,6,8,"i stay 2 nights pay for the expensive suite and simon the recepcionist didn't let my exgirlfriend go in, this was really not polite when i am booking a private suite !! a part warm water missing and security lock in my room didn't work but still simon didn't care anymore.."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,8,10,8,8,6,8,10,"was nice, clean and the people were pretty friendly. the area was a bit rough, but really close to the beach which is what we wanted. it was difficult to get to and from main la/hollywood without a car. one annoying thing was that we had to give them $100 key deposit - as i was leaving the usa after this so i had to get it refunded onto my card (and was charged to convert it to and from dollars). the food was pretty basic, but it was fine to live off for a week - cheap and cheerful :d"
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a great place to stay! the hostel is nice, with big rooms. the staff here were all so nice and helpful! they provide both breakfast and dinner free! which was amazing!! the location is fantastic! you can see the beach from the balcony! we had a really great stay!"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,great location   value for money considering the price of other hostels in the area and breakfast and dinner is included.  friendly staff. but hidden policies inregards to deposits for rooms which are not shown on hostel world reflect upon the staff negativley. i wasn't able to check into the room without paying a $100 deposit which was not stated on hostel world or the hostels own website. given that i was at the end of a 12 month trip i did not have the money for this.
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,10,6,"it was good. staff were great, room was everything we needed and it appeared secure. only comment would be that the common area was unpleasent for a non-smoker due to smoking inside."
England,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"the hostel is very old, all of the chairs are in tatters the bathroom had several cracks and nearly everything could have done with an update. having said that i had a fantastic stay. the amenities were good, the location to venice beach is excellent and the staff were really helpful and fun. the only really awful thing was the shuttle company were incredibly useless, and it took on average 40 minutes to book a shuttle. venice itself is not the safest of places, full of homeless people and weed!"
Norway,Female,18-24,6.3,4,6,10,6,4,8,6,"loved the location and the atmosphere. they had a few problems with the bookings of me and others, so double check  that your payment has gone through."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,the fact that some people gave horrible reviews (i.e. 60% and below) is absolutely crazy.  this place is really cool and the location is excellent.  there is plenty of food in the morning and at night.   no one should be complaining about this place.
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel was amazing!! the staff were all really helpful and kind and i loved it there! the location was real good right n the beach and about a 15 min walk to santa monica pier and transport was really easy to get to places.  i highly recommend this hostel for anyone looking for a place by the beach, you also get free breakfast and dinner."
Poland,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,"it was a great stay @ venice beach hostel! amazingly located just few steps towards the boardwalk and the ocean! the staff is really nice and helpful and free breakfast and dinner is definitely a plus! i am coming back for sure, hopefully for a longer stay!"
Germany,AllMaleGroup,25-30,8.3,6,10,8,6,10,10,8,"we only slept in the hostel and did nothing else, even breakfast and dinner was missed by to much sleep"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,10,6,"the staff are amazing people, i had the best time ever, met lots of people. i look forward to returning"
Brazil,Male,31-40,4.9,6,4,6,4,6,4,4,need for reform!  i didn't like!
Switzerland,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"very friendly and helpfull staff. the rooms are simple but clean. in the habitable rooms its easy to find other travelers. piano, tv, kitchen --&gt; i liked it a lot!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,fantastic location!!! room had a strong funny smell but luckily there are stalls on the boardwalk selling incense so that fixed that problem up. the cleaners took our towels on day 2 and failed to replace them for the remainder of the stay which was a little annoying. also sharing a room with a friend and only having 1 key between us for the room made things a bit difficult when we wanted to do separate things.
Russia,Male,18-24,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"most of the staff are not professionals but guests who want to stay for free. that's why they are lazy, rooms are filthy. i left my surfboard for 3 days there. i asked one of the members of staff if i can put it in storage room. he said it was ok and he would put it himself. and when i returned i realized it was wet and sandy and was used hour ago. someone surfed on it. so don't trust them. wi-fi signal is very poor in rooms. the worst hostel on venice in my opinion"
Spain,Male,25-30,7.1,4,8,10,6,8,8,6,"free dinner means rice with half boiled potato, poor black beans and vegetables as a condiment... i wasn't expecting the best dinner of my life but this was really really poor, felt kind like a homeless.   breakfast with pancakes was ok.  suggestions: a little bit of milk, eggs, fruit..."
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,3.7,2,4,8,2,4,4,2,"only good thing about this hostel is the location. hostel &amp; staff suck. when we arrived we had to pay a deposit of $25 each, also we had to pay $10,50 taxes per person per night! on top of everything they wanted us to pay $3 each for paying with one credit card. i went to the boa nearby &amp; paid $3 once for getting cash. towels weren't included, $0.50 each for washing them. we had to share our bathroom with at least 6 girls because there was another room in our room, but we booked a 6 bed dorm!"
England,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"been all over the work in hostels and this i up there with the best of them. staff were incredible and fun, quests were awesome, location was perfect! right on the beach! sad to have had to leave but already planning my next trip there!"
Italy,Female,25-30,6,4,6,10,6,8,4,4,"the hostel structure is old and there was a terrible smell. the lobby seemed a basement and it was old too. absolutely not beautiful to see. the first time i saw the lobby i thought it was a joke. anyway the position was great and a part from the bad smells, room were big."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,"fun staff, some are a bit serious but always willing to help out. rooms are sometimes loud if you have view on rooftopterrace. in general clean rooms, clean bathrooms. good laundry facilities! in 5 minutes on the beach. breakfast is fun cause you make your own waffles, or pancakes. and they have eggs, and bread, with jam and butter! simple but good. when theres karaokenight, they tend to smoke in common area, leaving the hostel blue and smelly... a pity. i had a good/safe time there! thanx!"
Germany,Couple,18-24,5.1,2,8,8,4,6,4,4,"well, it is a bit difficult.  short: dorms totally sucks, privates are  good!  smoking in the common rooms and floors. that is totally a no go!   and online was never a word about this.    extra charges everywhere!  extra charge for paying with credit card? per person per night 3 dollars?   seriously?   so bring your money cash!!!    1 dollar for one printed sheet? seriously?  that's ridiculous! mire than 10 cents is a rip off!      so think about it people!!!"
Hungary,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,it is a good hotel near the ocean
Australia,Male,31-40,6.6,4,6,10,8,8,6,4,"old shakey beds. steps for the top bunk would be handy, lockers in romms would be helpful"
Portugal,Male,31-40,4.9,4,4,8,6,6,4,2,"the hotel is very dirty. smells bad. some of my clothes still have the smell of the room. there was a heavy/smelly atmosphere inside the room and i got a cold because of it. it's a dirty environment and i got some sort of virus. the neighbourhood is full of drugged people. don't recommend at all. the staff were nice in general but on my arrival one of the guys asked me to wait for over half an hour while he was ""getting some work done"". i only have not gone ballistic because i had just arrived."
NorthernIreland,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,very friendly and helpful staff. i'd definitely recommend staying here.
Australia,Couple,18-24,5.1,4,6,8,4,4,6,4,nothing special. place always smelt like buds and come night time the streets around the hostel fill up with crackheads but hey i guess thats just hell-a in general. great place to stay if you like drugs i'm sure it wouldn't be hard to score around venice beach.
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,6,8,8,"this hostel was great, right by the beach. our room was nice and spacious and the free dinners were great. only negative was the rude woman who checked us in."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"had a great time, staff were excellent!"
Switzerland,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,nice hostel in a very good location (right next to the beach). cool and very helpful staff!
England,Male,25-30,5.1,6,4,10,4,6,4,2,"the hostel is in the best location and the staff were very helpful. however, the main issue for us was the cleanliness and the decor.it is extremely dated and is in desperate need of a facelift that would bring into the 21st century. the rooms would need new furniture and new carpet as well as the sheets need to be replaced as they were stained and borderline disgusting. finally, the luggage room needs to be in a more secure place! the hostel would be brilliant if they would invest money into it"
Germany,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,6,6,8,4,4,the place was quite dirty and people staying there relatively weird. would rather stay somewhere else if i go back to l.a.
England,Female,18-24,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"i was meaning to have a week in hollywood and a week in venice on the beach. venice was my second week and i felt very uncomfortable. the staff on reception were unfriendly, their 'suitcase storage' was a space on the landing with no door, let alone a lock. i paid my cancellation fee and left - i couldn't face staying there."
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great room with our own pc, located right around the corner from venice beach boardwalk which is a great start for a half day mosey up to the venice beach wharf. really cool staff as well :d"
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"a decent place to stay, private rooms were cleaned daily and tidy. free internet was a little on the slow side but great for looking up bus timetables and maps etc.    it's close to venice beach, the boardwalk and all the shops, about a 40min walk from santa monica pier. a little far from la proper (hollywood etc), bus took an hour to get there or a $25-30 cab. perfect place to stay if you're wanting to beach-it-up but not ideal if you're wanting to see the city."
Australia,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"thanks for a wonderful stay, everyone was very helpful and nice.  will stay again"
Italy,Male,25-30,4.6,4,6,10,2,6,2,2,bad experience at venice beach hostel.we booked for a 6 dorms and they put us in a 15 dorms!!!!  the atmosphere is really strange inside and everythings is really old and dirty; specially in the kitchen.  just a bad place to sleep in a really cool venice beach!  venice beach is ok just during the day; if u wanna have fun by the night you have to book one hostel near hollywood.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,cool place very close to the beach friendly staff and would highly recomend
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wow, this was such a cool hostel. easy buses to everywhere from the hostel.. the free breakfast and dinner was a plus. and you get free wi-fi and there's a computer in the room. the staff was very helpful and friendly. they also had karaoke and if you sing you get a free shot or beer. and the beach is a 1 minute walk. i will definitely be back and i do recommend  this place"
Mexico,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"personnel really helped us out with a  lot of stuff, and were superfriendly all the time.hostel's locatcloseion is definitely a plus, cuz is ello connected to bus stations ,groceries stores and restaurants."
Poland,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it's definitely great hostel. great place, staff, breakfast and dinner for free, internet for free, tee and coffee all day."

Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"very close to the venice boardwalk and close to numerous bus routes. staff were extremely friendly and helpful with anything and everything, would stay again if staying in venice"
Canada,Male,25-30,8,6,6,10,8,10,10,6,"fun place, couldn't ask for much more"
USA,Female,41+,6.9,6,8,10,6,8,6,4,staff was great. so is location. cleanliness and condition of furnishings left something to be desired.
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,6,2,10,4,6,8,4,"i found the location of the hostel amazing...you cant ask to be much closer to the beach,  however we booked a room that was advertised for  6 people. travelling as a group of 5 we found this to be a cheap ideal way to stay in venice beach!    they put us in a room with 13 beds and an ajoining room with more beds, well we only had 4 beds and had to share the first night!  also had $200 stolen and a bottle of vodka!! lock your things..."
Australia,Couple,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,really great value for money and we enjoyed our stay here.
Canada,Male,41+,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,10,6,"wrote my trip on, http://www.travelcheapwithpete.com/"
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,6,10,8,10,10,8,great place. 1 block from beach and skatepark. excellent staff.
Germany,Couple,25-30,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,nice clean hostel. the free dinner is very nice and also that they have free spices was sweet. ah hostel as it should be.
England,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,lovely will have to come back!!!
Poland,Female,,5.7,4,6,8,4,8,6,4,"the hostel was filthy, especially the bathrooms with their walls covered with mold. t the building is nice ad old and they should definitely invest some money in refurbishing it, as there were some breakdowns (electricity and water) and also lots of rust! it was also extremely noisy at night and there were more people in the room than expected! i payed to stay in a room for 6 ppl, but there was an additional bed there! i think it's unfair. for the conditions offered, it's far too expensive."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is everything you need in venice beach. location is perfect, free internet and computers, theres free parking near by, breakfast is awesome waffles and the staff are super cool, really friendly. our 8 bed dorm had two bath rooms and was really big. loved the time i had there!"
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay, staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  other guests were also friendly and a lot of fun. i will  dedinately stay there again on my next visit to venice."
Australia,Couple,31-40,8.3,6,10,10,8,10,6,8,no dramas in a good location.  a little tired and could do with a makeover but staff made up for this.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great experience. friendly and helpful staff. free breakfast and dinner and wifi. awesome location.
Singapore,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,really close to the main area of venice beach! good locality and easy to get there from the airport
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,10,8,6,8,"we enjoyed the stay here, was definitely value for money. we had waffles for breakfast which was awesome. free tea and coffee. there was also a pool table and tv area. . ."
Malaysia,Female,31-40,5,0,6,6,0,6,4,4,"this was my first visit to us. i arrived at the hostel at night. took a walk along the beach. there was nothing going on and populated with homeless. it was not the image i had of venice beach, from all the good reviews on it. there was not many restaurants located next to the hostel. not many options on public transportation. the overall room &amp; toilet was not exactly clean and well kept.    this is an ideal location if you would like to experience the morning &amp; day of venice beach."
England,Female,31-40,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"fantastic location - a minute from the beautiful beach!  really friendly, organised and well run hostel - great, helpful staff"
Australia,Couple,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,very good. had an awesome time. very clean. and dinner was ok for free.
Australia,Male,25-30,7,0,6,8,0,6,6,8,"this hostel was ok, and pretty close to the venice beach boardwalk. the venice area is a little dodgy but i never really had any problems there. brekkie and dinner included which was good however no activities are organized by the hostel which was disappointing. all in all, if you are going to stay at venice - this place is pretty good."
Germany,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,8,6,wasn't that clean but ok for the price. i stayes there for 2 nights with two friends of mine.
USA,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"outstanding! the receptionist is hot...you can hold an impromptu party there...my room was clean. it's a friggin hostel people. the hostel that's hella close to one of the coolest beaches in ca. only complaint...""deposits"". i had to give a $100 deposit for my room. got it back as soon as i checked out....but...eh. otherwise...it's tops! -keith"
CzechRepublic,Female,25-30,6,0,8,6,0,8,6,4,"location is good if you want to stay close to the beach, but it´s possible to get there by bus. the building from outside is horrible, it is old, not nice.. i didn´t have warm water in shower. i was glad to stay there just for one night. but the staff was nice, i had breakfast - included - pancakes. that was great."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,great location. we enjoyed our private room.
NewZealand,Female,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,venice beach is a fantastic place to stay in la if you want to have some fun and go to some decent bars with good music! not for bars with cheesy top 40 tunes but actual live gigs with good atmosphere.  the hostel is in a fantastic location 5 minutes walk from the beach and i found the room spacious and clean and the staff fine to deal with.
England,Couple,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"the hostel is located right on venice beach which was perfect for the 3 lazy days we were after. we did have a day in hollywood but be advised the bus trip took nearly 2 hours. the free breakfast and dinner is a big bonus, not a massive variety but free food so cant complain.  staff were helpful &amp; always willing to answer your questions. venice beach was the most expensive hostel we stayed at whilst in america and be aware that you have to pay a $100 dollar deposit on arrival."
CzechRepublic,Male,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,8,8,6,the location is perfect...just one block from famous and gorgeous venice beach...totally worth it
England,Female,18-24,8,0,8,10,0,6,8,8,fantastic location - amazing for the price we paid to be so close to the beach &amp; right in the center of the action on the boardwalk. the hostel provided good breakfast &amp; dinner every day. the disadvantages - there was no laundry room &amp; the staff were quite rude &amp; wern't always helpful. i came in our room 1 day to find all my clothes &amp; belongings moved off my bed &amp; onto the dirty shelves &amp; kept there. we enjoyed our stay there &amp; it was very good value for money.
Spain,MixedGroup,25-30,4,0,2,8,0,2,6,4,"im still waiting to get the deposit back. they were supposed to refund it to us at the check out. however there was nobody at the reception. we left a note asking them to contact us urgently but 36 hours after, i'm still waiting.   we are now thinking what to do but regardless of the end, what an unpleasant experience."
Slovakia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,0,6,10,0,6,10,8,"worths the price...it's like a hippy place :) ....i recommend for young people. the breakfast, dinner was simple, but at least food to eat, the kitchen with equipment. very close to the sea, in the area lots of homeless. downtown s far, but if you want to rest on the beach its perfect."
Spain,MixedGroup,25-30,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,8,great place for young travelers! but be carefull with the neighborhoud  at night.
Germany,Female,25-30,8,0,4,10,0,8,10,10,"the rooms were ok and had a prvate bathroom that was rather clean. the staff was friendly however there were not willing to call an airport shuttle which usually hostels do, from my experience, and it is also not possible to wash laundry in the hostel because there is only one machine which is occupied by the staff 24h and if you are lucky and ask the hostel manager you can wash at 6 am but that never worked out. dinner and breakfast is very basic."
Denmark,Male,25-30,5.3,0,4,8,0,4,4,8,didn't like they closed the door at 4 am. maybe they should freshn' up the commonarea looks like when they build it. and get some wi-fi that works properly.
Ireland,Couple,25-30,3,0,4,2,0,2,4,4,"venice beach is the worst place you can choose to be on the beach near la!simply not the place you will expect. there is nothing around except for homeless, rubbish and old buildings. the hostel is very poor maintained, quite dirty, internet is choppy, there is no breakfast unless you want to cook your own waffles in a dirty kitchen and you also have to wash the dishes! advice: spend 30-40 dollars more and stay in santa monica which is 5 minutes by car from venice beach but is fantastic!"
Ireland,Female,18-24,5.3,0,4,8,0,4,4,8,"great location, no character, pretty average."
England,Male,31-40,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,6,8,"i booked a private room for 2 nights.  the decor was dated but the room was clean, spacious and met all my requirements.  there was some noise from the cars outside, but this did not bother me.  the rooms appear to be old apartments that have been converted into a hostel.  my room had a bathroom, a utility room another room with a sink (used to be the kitchen) then a large main room with two double beds.    overall very happy.  great location, decent value for the money."
Switzerland,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,8,"i stayed there twice in a month because i had a lot of fun there. the common area is a place where you can meet other travellers and most of them know how to party. if you're young and like to have fun this hostel is the best you can choose, located in the perfect spot in venice beach."
Italy,Male,25-30,9,0,10,8,0,10,10,8,when you arrive the place looks a bit run down but the room are clean and the staff is helpful. there's a very large space to socialize with other travellers and a lot of table games and movies. the area is completely desert at night. good place to stay would come back again.
Italy,MixedGroup,25-30,6.7,0,8,8,0,6,4,8,"nice rooms , just a few second to the beach , nice people and clean enough . good price, not too far from l.a. downtown . maybe the only defect is that it's got no parking , but there's somewhere close to it free"
Denmark,Female,25-30,3,0,2,4,0,4,2,2,had a 12 person dorm even though i booked a 6 person dorm. area unsafe when it is getting dark. would not recommed this hostel.
Argentina,Male,18-24,7.3,0,8,10,0,6,4,8,breakfast s great
USA,Male,18-24,6.7,0,8,10,0,4,6,6,"nice hostel right on the beach/boardwalk.  a bit dated in the common areas.  also, they cancelled our first nights reservation and did not tell us about it in advance.  my girlfriend and i had to share the bottom bunk in an 8 person, rather than our private suite...the staff was somewhat understanding."
Canada,Male,18-24,7.7,0,6,10,0,8,8,6,"pros: beside beach, free dinner/breakfast, staff helpful, large common room, computer with internet in private room, large room.     cons: room smelled, smoking allowed in common room, bit sketchy, far from downton la, finding parking may take some time."
China,Female,41+,5,0,6,6,0,4,4,4,very noisy all night because the rooms are right next to street and without any sound-proof. room are old and dirty. one of the staff is not friendly.
Belgium,Male,18-24,7,0,6,8,0,8,6,8,dinner? that wasn't so great. not necessary to promote that part of the service. paying an additional fee if you pay by credit card is quite ridiculous and i have never ever seen this somewhere else.
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,"the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the location is almost impossible to beat.  the room was clean and spacious and even had a computer inside the room!  unfortunately, i didn't realize that the room didn't have ac. it wasn't a problem for me, but i was traveling with a girl and she wasn't about to have that. i wish we could've stayed here. just take note that they don't have ac or elevators. next time i won't travel with a girl and this place will be perfect, lol."
Ireland,Female,18-24,6.3,0,6,10,0,6,4,8,"not much of a vibe to this hostel, however it is literally right around the corner from the beach, our room had it's own private computer with unlimited internet access and rooms were kept clean. the free dinner was cook your own spaghetti and the free breakfast, waffles, was good but there could be a large queue in the mornings to use the waffle makers. but nice rooms and good value."
Canada,Male,25-30,6.7,0,8,10,0,8,4,4,$100.00/night is pretty expensive for a hostel
Australia,Male,41+,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"mate this is rob &amp;oskar  from australia , king karl ,jumping jeff  vic,yana,joe the a team,i had no probs ,its almost a free for all  i travelled with my 13 year old son ,they welcomed o in like one of the team  all the chicks looked after him, at night if i wasent around abloke   would always help him when he wanted to shoot pool or go outside for an ice cream , we rode skate boards  at midnight ,played the piano  i even learnt how to shuffle(dance keep on shufflin)   10 outa 10  i rippped big time!!"
Australia,Female,31-40,6.7,0,6,10,0,6,6,8,"the place is a bit dated and could do with a bit of a revamp. do your research if booking a tour of la, the one we booked through the hostel was not good and way overpriced.  excellent location right near venice beach."
France,Female,18-24,7.3,0,8,4,0,10,8,6,i was good free breakfast coool staff
Australia,Male,25-30,6,0,10,6,0,8,2,6,"at other hostels there have been planned activities, the staff get involved with people staying there, it's like they are part of the fun.     this hostel had little character and the staff, although friendly enough, were not what i look for in a hostel when on vacation. usa hostels staff members were better as they were generally on holidays themselves so they knew how to have fun.    at this hostel it seemed like it was a job."
Australia,Couple,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"eveything was excellent, only thing i could say would be maybe ditch the computers in exchange for t.vs in the rooms....and maybe just keep 2 or 3 computers for the common room..."
England,Male,41+,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,10,"50% more expensive for a private room than all the motels we stayed at but compared to everything else we could find in the venice/santa monica area, it was a bargain."
Australia,Couple,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"unfortunately we were directed to the wrong bus to the airport. the hostel was very quiet (may have had to do with the fact that we were travelling over the xmas period), so you had to create your own fun, however the large lounge areas and pool table helps. the free dinner is great for the budget-conscious!"
USA,Male,18-24,5,0,6,4,0,6,6,4,"i would not recommend this hostel. la is huge, and venice beach, while nice, is simply too far away from many things in la. a more central location, such as near hollywood, is much better for really exploring la. staying at venice beach, we spent a lot of time on public transport (seriously consider renting a car) and didn't even make it downtown.   i thought that the hostel itself was not clean, the rooms were devoid of any charm, and the staff was not particularly helpful."
Austria,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,8,0,8,8,6,"we had to change our reservation a bit and the stuff react very flexible. because we split our stay we stayed in two diffrent rooms both were okay, but for this price we aspected something different. there were foreign hairs on the linen and the towells. everything was a kind of old, you know how old carpets are....they had nice paintings allover and the wifi and the computer with internet in den room was free and great."
Venezuela,Male,25-30,8,0,8,10,0,8,6,8,"the staff is great, except for what i believe is to be the manager who although i had a private room with kitchen, he did not let me take food in the room, in a not so nice tone.    location is great! i hope you guys enjoy it!"
England,Couple,25-30,3,0,4,2,0,4,4,2,"the room was dirty and had an overwhelming smell of urine, the bed and sofa covers had what looked like urine stains on them. some of the staff were friendly but generally they were quite curt and did not offer any additional helpful advice or information than necessary. there were no information leaflets or local advice pamphlets available, just an old, used map that sat on the reception desk.the general atmosphere was not a friendly one and i would not recommend this hostel to others."
England,Male,18-24,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,8,8,great location and venice beach is definately the place to stay in l.a.free breakfast and a kind of free dinner which was good. the location is fantastic but if you are a light sleeper then it is very loud outside at night. however i would reccomend it
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,6.7,0,8,10,0,2,6,6,"we did not like that people were allowed to smoke inside the hostel! breakfast was supposed to be at 8 am, they opend it at 8.40 am :("
Spain,Male,31-40,8.7,0,10,10,0,8,10,6,"the best time in california! nice staff, great guests and in the middle of venice beach! what else do you want? breakfast and dinner included, not fancy but great for value! the place to be in venice beach!"
Germany,Couple,18-24,7.7,0,10,10,0,6,8,4,"great location, price is ok, but the rooms could have been cleaner (especially the bathrooms!). pro: computer in the room, a lot of space, furniture...."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.3,0,8,10,0,10,10,10,i stayed in many hostels across the states &amp; this was my favourite by far. prime location &amp; awesome culture. also the staff are excellent &amp; nice &amp; friendly. i met the coolest people here! was there 3 days &amp; it wasn't enough!
Austria,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,8,8,8,"it is very close to the bus stop of metro (to downtown la, union station or with transfer to hollywood) and the big blue bus (to santa monica or with transfer to airport/lax)"
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,7.7,0,8,10,0,6,8,6,"hostel was pleasant. wi-fi was a little tempermental at times. they give you food and ingredients to make your own dinner every night. there was some stupid women guest trying to touch my food on the stove though. that was the only negative. parking not on a street side where supposed street cleaning is supposed to take place is a bit of a hassle. don't think they clean the streets very often, the whole place kind of smelled like urine. but that's not a knock on the hostel. overall nice place."
England,Male,18-24,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,6,one word: amazing.
Sweden,MixedGroup,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"really a great hostel, nice rooms and clean. even better than some hotels or motels, the room was even cleaned during the stay and the beds made up.  easy to find parking. great and nice place to stay, very affordable!"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.3,0,6,8,0,8,6,8,"my stay here was ruined by some rude fellow hostellers. i stayed in a 6 bunk dorm &amp; my european roommates were loud, drunk, &amp; kept going in and out of the room between 11pm and 5am slamming doors and turning on lights.    i wouldn't normally mind, but this was a tuesday night and the live music venue straight across the street was ultra loud till around 12pm/1am.    the common room was ok...just a big bunch of big old couches and music. the staff were friendly and inviting."
USA,Male,18-24,3.1,2,2,2,6,2,2,6,"this is by far the worst hostel i have ever stayed at. the owner is extremely disrespectful with guests, he even cursed at a guest one day. the good thing he is not there all the time and hires students to do most of the work. really far from anything good, and not very secure. i highly do not recommend. "
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"staying at san vincente place was everything you could want in a hostel. it was clean and airy and light when you first walk in, with comfy couches and colorful chairs. the main manager, neema, was very helpful and friendly. later on conor helped me with my arrival as the evening staff. plus, they have a pool!    most importantly,  i got a really good night’s sleep there! breakfast was excellent - eggs, toast, cereals, coffee, lunch meats. almost european style. will definitely stay again!      "
Iran,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"easy to find, clean, spacious, welcoming staff.  has a very nice pool and multiple recreation areas with plenty of seating, which you will find comforting and relaxing to spend your time while staying here.    the rooms have very good quality, and sturdy wooden  bunk beds with a much larger scale twin size mattress that is super comfortable to sleep on.    the entire facility is professionally cleaned every single day. breakfast is available every single morning as well. plus lockers as well."
Canada,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,8,10," good place friendly staff, i'd come back again"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff was very helpful and nice. great place to stay.
Germany,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,6,8,4,4,the stuff is very friendly but the rooms and facilities are really dirty. there was bubblegum in my bed
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,very good overall....price e people are gentle....caring and saw my delay and did not charged me for the cancelation......just a good place to satay.i like it.
Romania,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,nice u had me there   thanks for the breakfast   liv bis 
Argentina,Male,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"i strongly disencourage you to come here. the recepcionist ride and violent with guests, he insulted me on the phone as i wanted to cancel the booking. "
England,Male,18-24,3.4,2,6,4,2,2,2,6,"kids bunk beds in the room, no atmosphere with other guests, if there was any, no group activities going on, couldn’t tell who was staying and who was staff, cheap but wouldn’t recommend "
England,Male,41+,6.6,6,10,8,6,8,6,2,it was ok to get your head down but very scruffy and i personally wouldn't stay there again.. staff were nice and friendly 
Romania,Male,18-24,6.3,8,6,10,6,4,6,4,"just be there to sleep and make a shower, in rest,  go in the city!!! "
Macedonia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice manager and staff! would like to come back again.
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,easy to find. staff very helpful. a ”no frills experience”  but for the bargain price it’s worth it. recommend it highly and will stay there again if back in la. 
USA,Male,25-30,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is reminiscent of a homeless shelter. actually, there are homeless shelters in better condition than this hostel. not only was there no air/ventilation. the pictures on the site are not accurate, up-to-date &amp; misleading. im surprised hostelworld allows this facility to list on the site. false advertisement. a guy (who's supposedly the manager) caught an attitude with me when i mentioned the air. i immediately left &amp; booked another hostel as i refused to pay for negativity."
Austria,Female,18-24,5.1,6,6,8,2,4,4,6,"one of the staff members was reall nice and tried to help us while the other one was pretty rude and didn't even care about us and our problems at all. the beds were horrible, loud and it felt like they're going to break any second. "
England,Male,31-40,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"worst hostel i've ever stayed in- dirty, seedy, shabby, smelly and zero security; staff who haven't a clue what they're doing and very bad air conditioning. also dangerous seeing junkies can easily (and do) get in off the street and steal guests' belongings and cause fights. total rip-off; i checked out after just one night to find a better place. stay away from this place at all costs; it's little more than a criminal establishment and needs to be closed down!"
USA,Male,25-30,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,there is no ac! avoid this place unless you like sleeping in a  sauna . 
Australia,Female,18-24,4.6,2,4,10,4,4,4,4,great location. rooms were tiny and the hostel was very old and kinda gross for the price that you are paying. the staff were lifeless and less than helpful. the whole area of hollywood was pretty safe so i would stay somewhere else for this price 
England,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,"bloody hot! it needs ac! if it had ac then i would rate it better value for money. the beds and sheets were clean. all was remotely comfy also. breakfast choice is limited. but is amazing if toast, sugary cereals (such as fruit loops) or doughnuts are your thing, then you are in your element. not that i was expecting an extravagant breakfast anyway. there is also a good amount. one member of staff wasn't so helpful or kind. it wasn't clear that she wasn't a morning person. location good also. "
Poland,Female,18-24,5.4,2,4,8,6,6,8,4,room was very hot and there was no glas in the window. old blanket was covering window. hostel was very dirty. i stayed in different hostel and pay so much less and it was way better. 
France,MixedGroup,25-30,2.9,2,4,6,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is literally the worst hostel ever, just a nightmare. the rooms and the bathrooms are so dirty (we found cockroaches in the bathroom). there was just one small fan for eight people in the same room. we were just sweating so badly as we couldn't sleep, so we just decided to stay outside as much as we could. i can't even have the how horrible it was. regarding the personnel, they were so rude and disrespectful with us. i don't understand how a hostel like this one can still be open."
England,Female,18-24,5.4,4,4,10,6,6,4,4,"this place just needs to bo closed and renovated. rooms were in a pretty horrible condition, shower handle fell off many times, the kitchen was really dirty. the staff were cleaning but there's no hope for a place that's been left to get that bad. they left the front door open till midnight so anyone could walk in, didn't make me feel very safe. most of the staff were really nice minus one who seemed extremely unhappy. they did serve breakfast but the kitchen was dirty which puts you off eating."
Spain,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,"the hostel was great: good location, nice staff and clean. bathroom in your room which is great! lockers kinda small but since you can lock your room and people don't tend to steal is secure af. a lot of you guys talk about the manager and his attitude, i think he's not bad but a great guy, you only need to understand him since he has a strong personality. they helped us with a complicated situation regarding the booking and were nice to us. shoutout to the black captain morgan! barcelona guys."
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,10,6,"friendly atmosphere, manager so welcoming during our stay. nice breakfast , good location. ideal for students on a holiday break to meet new people."
Thailand,Female,18-24,5.4,6,6,10,2,8,4,2,location is good. but the other is not ok for me.  this place has smell all the way. no air condition and elevator. but the price is ok for this place. if you can deal with dirtiness and hot temperatures. this place is for you 
England,Female,18-24,5.7,4,6,8,4,6,6,6,"defiantly not worth the money, the rooms are basic and very small, hard to cramp 6 people in one room! the beds aren't secure, i felt very unsafe climbing on and off the top bunk as the whole frame would shake! the front door was open all the time which was unsafe as we were right on hollywood blvd. the only positive is the location. "
Italy,Male,18-24,3.1,2,4,6,2,4,2,2,"all bad, dirty, sheet unclean (looked like they came from the rubbish), no elevator, for the price there is better  the only reason to came here is the location"
Wales,Female,18-24,6.3,6,8,10,6,4,4,6,"the staff were not the most accommodating, but  the location is good. there was no air con, which wouldn't have been an issue if the fans had worked in the room."
USA,Male,18-24,6.3,8,6,10,6,2,6,6,it was okay for price. the guest was very friendly. they have friendly staff here but the manager isn't nice at all. 
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6,6,8,10,4,4,4,6,"perfect location for hollywood and close to the metro station. staff very quiet and not often that helpful. the facilities such as kitchen and bathrooms were worn and mostly dirty. locks on rooms good. only 2 plug sockets in a room for 4 people and these were not near the beds. bunk beds tiny and you can't sit up in them. sheets smelled and had marks on them. overpriced for what it was, have stayed in a lot nicer places in la for cheaper."
Argentina,Male,31-40,4.6,6,6,2,2,8,4,4,the hotel is ugly and uncomfortable. it has no ac or ventilation in the rooms and smells funny. the upside is that they serve a decent breakfast. it is located next to a 24hs liquor store so lots of people gather around there all night long.
Singapore,Male,18-24,5.7,4,6,10,2,8,4,6,"bad facilities    the price of this hostel is way above the average price for a hostel bed, but i guess it's because of its location right on hollywood's walk of fame. aside from location, everything else was lacking. the biggest down side being that there is no air-condition or any sort of ventilation in the rooms, which with l.a.'s weather, makes it very uncomfortable. very tiny lockers located outside of the room, and main door was left wide open on the streets, questioning its security."
England,Male,18-24,3.1,2,4,8,2,2,2,2,"do nor stay here! awful stay, the rooms were unbearably hot, staff all seemed to work slave-like hours and were terrified of the boss, bathrooms were filthy and didn't get $10 key deposit back even though no one told me the check out time was 10 not 11.. location is fantastic but another hostel has opened doesn the road recently and i have heard amazing things about it so search for this other hostel and stay there! "
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,8,10,8,pretty neat. cool people.
Philippines,Male,31-40,4.9,2,4,10,6,8,2,2,"you wanna be miserable? stay here! you wanna sweat the whole day/night? stay here! you want a room with nasty carpets and horrible smell? please do stay here. no vibe to socialize here. and the cherry on top of the cream is the manager's attitude. he told me on my face that he's the manager in a really bad tone only because i chose to ask the reception instead of him. when i asked him if he was angry he said ""a little"". what am i his employee now? location is good but i would never stay again!"
Antarctica,Male,18-24,5.7,6,6,10,2,8,4,4,"it's alright just don't expect the ritz, i read the reviews before i went and they said the same however i wanted to see for myself. bring cash. the owner is a bit stressed, wouldn't accept punch in payments which is all i could do at the time, i get the risk of cancelled payments but you fix that by getting a signature.  some of the rooms are hotter than the sun"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,manager was extremely friendly and had an interest in the tenants staying at the hostel. the location was easy to access central hollywood and was in walking distance to most landmarks 
Colombia,Male,25-30,4,2,8,8,2,4,2,2,"no air conditioning and only one minuscule fan for 8 persons (and i never thought i could complain about that in any hostel), not enough clean restrooms, the breakfast is ok for an hostel, but for the rest is too expensive. the employees are nice, but the manager is too rude.    "
USA,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,the host was rude.  the place is absolutely filthy do not stay there.  i left after one day and they refused to refund my money that i prepaid for all the other days.  they prey on foreigners who do not know what a good hospital is like.  stay over at backpackers or any other hostel.  avoid this place at all costs.
Belgium,Female,25-30,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"i actively discourage to go to this hostel. the owner/manager clearly does not care at all for his guests. in short :  - overall lack of space, everyone is packed together like in a prison cell.   - no wifi in the rooms, nor in the tv room.   - not enough wall sockets, nowhere in the hostel.   - no locks for security lockers, you have to pay/bring your own.    2 other girls had to sleep in the hallway because there was no one to receive them, even though they had sent notice of their arrival hour. "
Malaysia,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,2,10,6,8,"i stayed here for 14 days, - location was great (near to metro station) - added value for free breakfast - friendly staff, especially christine! thx for your hospitality  things to improve: - the double decker bed is very unstable and noisy - the whole floor and room is very hot during summer, pls add more fan. - the wifi is super weak, only works nearby the reception area - its hard to find the electric plug in the room, pls provide more so the guest can charge phone beside their bed"
USA,Male,31-40,4.9,6,4,4,4,4,4,8,the staff was not very friendly.  didn't enjoy being on hollywood blvd.  too many tourists everywhere.  would like to have a yard and trees on the property and some nature in the back.  would like to have more space.  the kitchen and patio were tiny.  creepy weirdos living there.  good prices and i met a few fun people.  but definitely one of the worst hostels i've stayed at.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,just need betters bunk beds to squeaky at night &amp; a window that closes
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,10,6,8,6,6,4,4,"*definitely* needs to be cleaned better, and provide better places for people to put their luggage (i woke up on the top bunk to discover that a pile of suitcases was completely blocking the ladder down). convenient to get to by transit, though! and if the walk of fame is your thing, you're in the right place!"
Germany,Female,18-24,3.7,2,6,8,2,4,2,2,this hostel wa the worst i ever stayed in. it is so dirty they didn'teven clean/vacuumed our rooms once or touched the shower.  the bedsheets smelled like they haven't been washed in months. the staff was kinda friendly and the location too but everything else just creepy and disgusting. so if u go better bring ur own bedsheets.
Turkey,Male,25-30,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,worst hostel i ever stayed. let's start with the rooms. u have no air condition whatsoever. instead u got old fashioned vantilator with the cables all around the floor. electric plugs are really bad . rooms have no space for anything. sheets mattress pillow covers... very dirty with heavy stains. dont get towel from them they are dirty. manager doesn't know how to talk with ppl. very rude. thai and taiwan girl were best. don't stay here. location was good but save ur money for other hostel. 
Scotland,Male,25-30,6,6,6,10,4,6,4,6,"creakiest beds in the world, cramped hot rooms, not that bad overall though"
Netherlands,Male,18-24,6.6,8,6,8,6,6,4,8,"hostel could've been better, but the location was great, right at hollywood blvd. the owner was a little bit grumpy, not really a social hostel, but for the price it was allright. for 2 nights it was doable"
Australia,Male,41+,8,10,8,10,8,8,6,6,2 important point   perfect location perfect wifi 
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,6,4,6,4,metro and bus station are really close and you can go from there to everywhere.    the rooms are too tiny there is barley space to walk when everyone is in the room. it's really loud from the streets and also really hot in the rooms. it's not clean and the stuff isn't really helpful because it seems like they don't understand everything or everything you ask seems like to be a wrong question and you get not a very nice answer.   wouldn't recommend it! 
Ireland,Couple,18-24,9.1,10,6,10,10,10,10,8,great staff &amp; facilities are ok- impressed by the shower's power and temperature! breakfast is definitely first come first served but overall a great hostel. favourite part is the back patio. rooms quite cramped so pack light 
Ireland,Male,25-30,6,10,6,10,4,4,4,4,great location. right on the hollywood walk of fame. old and dirty though. also noisy as it on the main strip. good for one night but probably wouldn't stay there again. staff seem unhappy..
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"even though we booked 3months in advance, the staff was at first not sure if they had beds for us (2 girls). manager was very unfriendly and was condescending towards his employees in front of guests and told us about some kind of stomach flue he had just gotten over - very unprofessional and tmi. the room smelled really bad (no ventilation?), no lockers in the room (only in hallway, but no 24-hour reception), the shower was disgusting (hair). the place was really run down in general. very loud"
Canada,Female,18-24,6.3,8,8,10,2,6,6,4,"very good location, but no vibe at all... very small kitchen with not much gear to cook... very inconvenient ! "
USA,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,"this hostel is good if you are looking for a cheap room to sleep in, nothing else. for an 8-bed mixed gender dormitory, there is one bathroom for about 16 people. and by bathroom, i mean one toilet &amp; one shower that is pretty gross. definitely bring shower shoes if you must shower. the place is pretty rundown with very small lockers to lock your belongings in. it is right on hollywood blvd in the center of all the action. that being said, it can be pretty noisy at night. "
Argentina,Male,31-40,5.7,6,6,8,6,4,6,4,"probably the worst hostel i've ever stayed on. very dirty and old. the beds are very noisy and the carpet is bad, but the bathroom in the room is a nice thing though.  the staff is not helpful at all and they don't care about their clients.  the only good thing is the location which is very good in the main avenue of hollywood, but this point makes it very noisy.  i choosed this one because was the only one available in hollywood, but if i had to come back to la i won't stay in here again for sure."
Canada,Couple,25-30,3.7,4,4,6,2,4,2,4,stayed in mixed dorm. rooms were very dirty and grungy. mattress was ballooning up and it was difficult to keep from falling off the rickety top bunk. sheets supplied would not stay on bed; ended sleeping half on the mattress. towels were extra fee. front door was left open all day; seemed like anyone could walk in from the street. staff did not recommend things to do or see. okay location if you want to be in the center of hollywood.
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,6,8,"this hostel is great. i read a lot of reviews &amp; went anyways. yes, it's small and a bit cramped but the location is amazing. there is no curfew, and other travels are always hanging out on the patio. there is one worker there that is extremely rude, but christine makes up for it. she is amazing. "
Brazil,Female,18-24,6,8,6,10,4,6,4,4,"the beds are so noisy...the shower isn't good, small bathroom.  there aren't nice areas to hang out...the kitchen has only 4 chairs and the breakfast is poor: only bread, jelly and cereal.  the girl from reception was nice but the guys were rude! the only good thing about it is the location.  "
Ecuador,Male,31-40,5.1,6,4,10,4,4,4,4,"felt uncomfortable leaving stuff at hostel, administration lacking and forgetting to return change on every item i paid for.  it is what you paid for, cheap."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,2.9,2,4,2,2,6,2,2,"worst hostel experience i've ever had. the rooms are extremely dirty, no bed bug barrier on the mattress, blankets are visibly filthy, ""patio"" was tiny &amp; run down. housekeeping was a joke: 1 kid w/ a broom. only 1 outlet per room, kitchen was gross/no utilities, door to hostel is wide open all day &amp; into the night--not safe on hollywood blvd. only redeeming quality were two of the managers not including the owner, who was passive aggressive &amp; made us uncomfortable. don't ever stay here."
India,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,6,8,8,8,pros:  1. the staff is friendly  2.  location is amazing. the metro station is quite close by as well.   3. the information is provided well for tourism purposes.    cons:  1. there are no keys/locks they provide for lockers  2. the beds are extremely shakey and seem unstable.  3. the bathrooms don't have sprinklers
England,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,4.9,2,6,10,4,6,2,4,"it was very worn and not particularly clean, especially for the price. the only good thing was the location. the atmosphere wasn't great and the staff were all quite odd and made us feel a little awkward. we got a couple of loud knocks on the door at midnight which woke us all up, and then a staff member unlocked the door and let in another guest. this was a lengthy and loud process where it didn't need to be. "
Germany,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,10,4,6,4,2,the location is great. it's right on the walk of fame and a 2 minutes walk to the next train station. unfortunately this is the only advantage of this hostel. the staff as well as the facilities and the overall cleanliness of the hostel needs improvement. next time i will definitely choose a different hostel.  
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,8,6,8,4,6,4,4,"great location, but not what i expected. the pictures that are on the website are definitely dated. the bedrooms were tiny &amp; crammed &amp; the bunkbeds were old &amp; wobbly. the beds made so much noise at night &amp; moved around so it was a hard to get some good rest. i forget the woman's name who checked me in (might've been christine), but she was so nice, welcoming, &amp; informative. the manager however made me feel uncomfortable my second night staying."
Canada,Male,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i spent 5 nights here with a friend. we were upgraded from an 8 to a 4 bed dorm. staff who greeted us were friendly and all other staff seemed fine. the room was fine, and while it had a slight musk it was easily forgettable after a night there. the beds do creek but using ear plugs i never had a problem. however, the top person moving does shake the bed.  everything was clean throughout. the breakfast was basic but enough to get you through a few hours in the morning and omlets were made once. "
USA,Female,25-30,3.7,4,2,6,2,6,4,2, it's pretty dirty. it's where you stay if you have no money. and that's really the only reason. the staff asked like they don't want to be there. both the black guys who work the front desk were rude. the asian lady was really nice and so was the southern guy. not a place to hang out really. they have more rules than amenities. the staff works downstairs at the convenient store and also in the hospital so half the time they weren't even there. i will say the location is great for hollywood. 
USA,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,the manager tried extorting me for cash.  despite my having given my credit card online. said he couldnt find my reservation despite my name being on the paper right on his desk.  i was unable to stay and was without login during my trip. i would like a full refund of all charges.
Canada,Male,25-30,8.3,10,6,8,8,8,8,10,the location was great and i still had a good time
Germany,Female,25-30,5.7,6,4,10,4,6,4,6,"the rooms smelled, everyone could basically walk into the hostel and there were hardly any/no plugs in the rooms to charge your phone. perfect location, but i wouldn't stay longer than one night."
Peru,Male,18-24,6,8,6,10,4,4,6,4,"if you can, avoid it.  the staff is not too friendly. at least, the owner is some friendly.   the beds are really noisy! the restroom was a bit dirty.  towels are not included, they cost 2 dollars.  though, there was good company, i made good friends there. the breakfast is good, and you can see netflix in the tv room at any time.  "
France,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,10,6,8,4,good location and breakfast. old bed and rooms.
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,8,10,10,8,8,6,8,"decent, clean hostel in a perfect location to explore hollywood for the price. the interior decor and facilities could use some serious updating. gotta spend money to make money. thanks for letting me stay."
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,8,4,10,8,8,6,8,"the staff makes the stay worth it. that and the money you save. plus, i loved the proximity to key places and things in hollywood. and the lady from taiwan (i wish i remembered her name), is an angel. what ever you need, she's on it. if she's there when you are, you're lucky. my complaints are the need for updated furniture and better (quieter bunk beds).   i couldn't put this place in the number one spot because it isn't paradise, but when you're on a budget and need no frills, it's perfect."
Italy,Male,25-30,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,"considering the price, it can be worth it. location is good, basically in the middle of the walk of fame.  for what concerns facilities, structure, etc it is useful just for sleep."
Sweden,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,6,8,some parts were a little sketchy but the hostel did the job without a doubt - not the nicest one but considering the cost it definently works. had some great roommates so it made the experience better! thank you for having me!
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,10,6,"the hostel was good, clean, good locación close to the metro station. no locker in forma. great  atmosphere, breakfast was really good."
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"pros:  very friendly and helpful staff.  breakfast available from 8-10am.   rooms were spacious and hot showers available.   easy access to metro busses &amp; subway, restaurants and in the heart of hollywood to start of your adventure.  cons:  shower was clogged but there's another shower available."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,6,4,8,10,2,6,6,6,the room that i stayed in was extremely cramped.
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,2,6,10,6,4,4,8,"i have been to a lot of hostels in my life, but this one was by far the worst! it was clean, and in a great location, but our room was tiny and smelly, they should update their air conditioning system! the window was closed but it was still loud. the bed was horrible, mine was shaking every time i moved, as if about to collapse, plus no barriers on the top bed, you could just fall off!  the whole hostel is completely outdated and needs renovation desperately! we didnt feel welcome at all!"
CostaRica,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"in general, really good. just be aware that they don't give towels, but you can buy them for $3. "
Egypt,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is so convenient and just in the middle of the walk of fame. it is a walk distance from bus stops and metro station so you can visit downtown la and beaches so easily. it is not a fancy place but suitable and safe for just sleep since we spent most of the day hanging out. the staff are very friendly and helpful. moreover,  the price is so reasonable which is important for international students like me whose budget is limited. i enjoyed it and i would recommend it "
Mexico,Female,18-24,7.7,8,10,10,8,2,8,8,the hostel is in a good location. we stayed one night at the banana and bungalo hostel and this one was better(hollywood and highlands)  but we had an issue with one of the managers because he was really rude to us when we checked out. started yelling and being dissrispectfull because we couldn't understand what he was saying since he had rap music on so loud we couldn't hear him . we just wanted our key deposit back and he even asked my friend to leave for no reason at all.   
USA,Female,18-24,3.7,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,"honestly, this place was grimy and uncomfortable compared to the other hostels i stayed at in the area. i really didn't feel comfortable at all here. the amount of money spent on a night here could easily go to a hostel that's much nicer and cleaner..."
England,Male,25-30,6.6,8,4,10,6,8,6,4,"the girl with the greeny blue hair was very mysterious, what is she hiding behind those sunglasses? wish i asked for her name and number. "
USA,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,10,6,6,2,6,honestly this hostel felt a bit uncomfortable.  not the worst hostel i have stayed but certainly not the best.  walk of fame on the same street was a better experience.  my friend and i both felt a little uneasy when we were reminded a half hour before to turn in our keys and check out.  to be fair we did get good advise by the staff when we arrived at the hostel.  i recommend this hostel mostly if you plan on just going in and out since the location is great.
England,Female,18-24,3.1,2,2,8,2,4,2,2,"we wish we had stayed in the walk of fame hostel down the road!   this was so unclean, you get old blankets instead of actual bedsheets, the bunkbeds are woeful they are just tiny and dainty, designed for young kids not 20+ year olds, some members of staff are nice but some are really unnecessarily rude &amp; unhelpful, just really weird vibes there, no security and really dodgy lock on front door which means people struggle to get in &amp; have to ring the doorbell waking everyone up in the meantime. "
Australia,Female,18-24,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"nice hostel, very good and central location. decent breakfast. not overall social. has more long term people living there. staff are very friendly and helpful. would be good for groups or friends traveling together. "
Brazil,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,6,6,10,4,6,"i wouldn't recommend this hostel, especially for women traveling alone. the atmosphere is really weird and even a bit scary. besides me and my friend, all the other guests were men (or so it seemed), and they were watching tv drunk in a dark common room. the bedsheets had stains on them and the bathroom wasn't very clean either. about the location: even if it may seem good, it's not!   "
Australia,Female,31-40,5.7,6,6,10,4,4,4,6,"excellent location right on hollywood boulevard. some of the staff were lovely, most evidently pretty unhappy to be there. which makes sense because i've never known a manager to be so verbally abusive to staff in my life. swearing and yelling over tiny little things, right in earshot of the guests. the beds were really squeaky and shaky and the breakfast wasn't great. some of the sheets seemed newer, the ones i got were pretty gross. rooms were spacious enough. lockers outside the rooms."
Italy,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing time and fantastic staff 
Scotland,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,good hostel in a great location. i've been in many hostels and i understand living conditions tend to be less than any hotel but i found the room had a musky smell that me and my friends found quite strong. staff were nice enough however. it was very quiet whilst we were there and we only stayed a night but if you are looking for a place to stay on hollywood blvd for a short trip then this place is fine.
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,8,6,10,8,4,2,8,"awful tacky decor. wonderful hollywood location, good for getting around.    the owner i often heard being quite abusive of staff. serious like shouting matches. an employee was on the phone to what was clearly a customer who was disputing a fee  however i walk in to ask a question and just after i walk in i hear through and intercom, in a full shot, ""get off the phone it's not for personal use you have been on it for 15 minutes"". the man tried to explain, but the boss would have none of it. poor"
Norway,Female,25-30,4.9,2,4,8,2,8,4,6,"the beds were making awful sounds. (prison-like, of steel) the rooms were really tiny. "
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,6,10,10,8,"it was great and comfortable for me. if you choose this hostel, you will be disappointed about facilities of this hotel. but, i can ensure that the location give you super satisfaction. "
China,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,10,10,10,6,heart location and staff r good. especially the lady from taiwan. she is extremely passion always. breakfast is simply but enough. everything is awesome!
Brazil,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,8,6,8,6,perfect location. rooms a bit small but no problem. other people was having trouble with the staff but that didn't concern me.
Singapore,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,4,10,8,10,10,10,"great location at hollywood walk of fame. hostel was clean. it was winter, and there wasn't any heaters in the room. even with multiple layers of blankets, it still gets pretty cold. also, once i got back to the room and saw a stranger lurking around in the room. he removed my friend's (who was sleeping at that time) shoes. weird. also, there wasn't any parking available, so we had to spend a good amount of time every night looking for a parking spot blocks away from the hostel.

Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,10,6,10,10,"australian female traveller staying alone, this hostel was exactly what i needed for a cheap night close to all the sites of hollywood boulevard. male manager and lady employee were lovely and always happy to help, i arrived home late one night and there was still someone to ask questions which was helpful. male cleaning staff member was very rude, needs to work on social skills as he brings down the rapor built up by other staff members. breakfast was great, thank you very much :)"
USA,Female,18-24,4.9,6,2,10,4,6,4,2,"once we were finally showed into our rooms, i was shocked! the yellow walls were not only hideous, there was a plethora of unknown stains everywhere. right, next to my bed i had a hole/stain and other brown spots throughout the wall next to me. the beds were not even made and i was handed sheets and one blanket for the remainder of my stay. they left the front door open to the hostel until midnight which did not make me feel safe at all and i felt like anyone could get in. the kitchen was dirty."
Ireland,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,10,6,"really nice people in the hostel, especially my man david, he showed me all around hollywood from a director's point of view. highly recommend"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the hostel is amziliant! !! great staff,great bed,beautiful shower. just as remember that if yr over 35 don't book the place. which is understandable, those under 35 need a place to go. wish i had this when i was young. glad it is here now. "
Spain,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"i stayed few days and i had a great time, i will stay again another time, thank you ricardo!!!"
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i loved to stay there! it's a amazing hostel in the walk of the fame, well located, the staff are very cool, it's clean and i stayed in a room with a private bathroom: the best thing hahaha! the beds are comfortble but they make noise when you need to change your position but i think this isn't a huge problem. i loved and i think it's a good place to stay and very near of everything!! "
Russia,Male,25-30,5.4,6,2,10,4,6,4,6,"location is the only good thing that i can say about this hostel.  people staying there  are very strange, lots of them have been staying there on kind of  permanent basis. kitchen is ok,  but everything is very used and dirty. there is smell of old furniture and inside of the hostel. room is very noisy due to opened widows to the busy boulevard."
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is the best hostel i've stayed at in the us! they have free breakfast, free shuttles to major places in town, and when i stayed there, they had a free comedy night with free drinks. it was incredible! i loved it here! i would absolutely stay here again. the place is super clean and like a 4 star hotel.  "
England,Female,25-30,6.9,8,6,10,4,8,6,6,perfect location and good breakfast! just a little run down and in need of an air freshener.    our only problem was that the bathroom was located outside of our dorm and it was constantly busy with people using it from other dorms (when they had their own bathrooms in their own dorms) but other than that this is a good hostel  for travelers who want to see the sights of la and don't want to spend much time in the hostel. 
Germany,Female,18-24,5.7,4,4,10,4,8,4,6,"location is amazing - be sure to bring earplugs. rooms are facing the hollywood boulevard. no aircon, was okay for october, but i would not want to stay there in hot summer. everything was a bit rundown but okay clean. facilities could be better, kitchen was small. hostel had everything you need, just not very modern and nice. white pricey for what they offer. staff was friendly."
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,4,10,10,8,8,8,10,"good staff and location. the place is somewhat small but has all you need; tv room, balcony, kitchen, maps and info. internet is very slow.  the room is fine with it's own toilet however they have the worst bunk beds i have ""slept"" on. if you are on the top of the bunk bed you are pretty much screwed; light and fan on your face, no rail or near enough a wall to lean your back on or avoid your stuff from falling off, moves a lot, no outlet, pathetic pillow and not exactly easy access on and off."
England,Male,18-24,4.3,2,4,6,2,8,4,4,pretty grim hostel. didn't look massively clean in the bath room and kitchen. we've stay at other hostel for the same money and they had more atmosphere and better facilities. i don't like being negative but compared to other hostels it's bad. 
Mexico,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"best thing about it is the location, easy subway access, right on the walk of fame."
Finland,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,8,8,6,hostel was good! 
Scotland,AllMaleGroup,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"please note this hostel has no air conditioning. it's southern california, ridiculous. when i asked for an extra fan for the room because there was no air con the manager swore at me and told me i was lucky to get a fan. we left and got a hotel. the hostel is right on the main street so the bedrooms are incredibly noisy. do not stay here."
Poland,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,6,10,10,6,"hostel was not so beautiful, but the localization was perfect and we had breakfast included. this is what i could expect for this price, but still i enjoyed. also the place makes a lot of opportunities to talk with other people from hostel."
Russia,Female,18-24,6.3,8,8,6,6,4,6,6,so old hostel
England,Male,31-40,4.3,6,4,6,2,4,6,2,"awful awful place. mould everywhere, rooms incredibly hot.   rude and aggressive staff members.     would never ever stay there again.   awful place. "
Turkey,Female,18-24,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"there was no plug in the room so i couldnt charge my phone, the beds were extremely uncomfortable and dirty, nobody told me anything about the checkout time so tomorrow when i asked the receptionist yelled at me. "
Turkey,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,i really appreciate for everything during the time i stay in this place. staffs were really friendly and helped us about everything we asked. they serve also breakfast every morning which is a wonderful thing to have when you r looking for a cheaper travel plan. breakfast was not so rich but it was enough. different cereals every morning toast and waffles on the weekends. rooms were large enough. bathroom was also good. location is great! we never spend any money for metro or anything. great!!!
Brunei,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,4,6,6,8,"you are literally paying for the location. right on the hollywood walk of fame, 24hr subway across the street and the chinese teatre as well as marshalls just a minute away.  there were some homeless people constantly at the entrance of the hostel and it was the only place to go for a cigarette. i didn't like having to deal with them constantly. the beds were extremely wobbly and shaky and the pillow was ridiculously lumpy. don't expect much. "
Japan,Male,31-40,6.3,4,6,10,6,8,4,6,stuff are nice.but only one bathroom for crowded hostel was very very uncomfortable.    
Brunei,Female,18-24,5.7,8,4,8,6,4,4,6,you are literally paying for the location. don't expect anything more. i booked an all female dorm and a man was suddenly put in our room. the beds swayed and squeaked a lot. the pillow was super lumpy. there were homeless people right outside the stairs and made it difficult to have a smoke. breakfast was decent however with a subway right across the street. 
Ireland,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"i recently enjoyed two weeks in hollywood and highland hostel.  the location is great, the staff are friendly and there is even an irish bar within walking distance!  i could also walk to such television shows as dr phil and the price is right.  however if you want to visit the nearest beach or have a night out at a gay bar public transportation is needed.  although there were many beggars in hollywood i found the building reasonably clean and safe.  you can prepare your own food in the kitchen."
England,Male,18-24,7.1,10,4,10,8,4,8,6,"an interesting experience.. when i arrived the guy in the office was agitated. not only was he demanding, but kept referring to a ""f*cking stupid b*tch"" under his breath. fair enough, and when he gave me a tour he brightened up a bit (except for randomly and angrily telling someone off for sitting in a dark room). he also wore his cap so low that when he looked at you, only his nose and mouth was visible, not his eyes. maybe it's because i'm tall? long story short, great location, weird staff"
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"you get what you pay for, great location. i&amp;#39;m not high maintenance so suited me really well"
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,"if you are just needing a place to crash while in hollywood, this is a solid bang for your buck. the staff were friendly and accommodating. the rooms/washrooms weren't anything to marvel, but the price was the best i could find for simply needing a place to lay my head on a friday night."
Taiwan,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,the location is good.  but the hostel owner just wanted to charge money.  that was so worst travel experience in la.  i already deposited the 10 bucks the when i checked out later about 10 minutes then hostel said you later 10 minutes &amp;#39;now is 10:10. check out time is 10am. that was ridiculous to take the 10 bucks for change.  one night that it&amp;#39;s!
Australia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,4,8,10,"everything was pretty good, breakfast in the morning was awesome!!   only down fall was the staff very openly arguing in the hall way outside of the tv room. the asian lady there was really rude when she would come in and clean.   other than that it was good 👍🏽👍🏽"
Germany,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,6,10,6,6,"its right on hollywood blvd (walk of fame) and theres a ton of shopping right outside the door. the staff is extremely nice and accommodating. the rooms are in desperate need for some tlc, the bunk beds are one of the worst ones ive slept in and theyre not too big on cleanliness. getting time in the bathroom is nearly impossible and the rooms are hottt. the kitchen is pretty gross and i feel like the price pretty steep. ok for one night, wouldnt stay there for longer though."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,5.7,6,6,10,6,2,6,4,very disappointed with staff members - incredibly rude and unprofessional. 
Australia,Female,18-24,4,2,2,8,2,4,4,6,"the doors were never locked, people could just waltz into your rooms. the receptionist was going to put us in a smelly cramped staff room because they didn&amp;#39;t have any female dorms left which i booked on the website so we had to go to a co ed one. the location is great but the hostel and staff are odd and it was an uncomfortable experience. "
England,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,"best location for hostels on hollywood boulervard. it&amp;#39;s a basic hostel located on the strip. the breakfast is good, safe place, staff are friendly and very helpful. bunk beds are basic and cleanliness is average. but your paying for the location which is fantastic and would purely recommend purely on that basis."
Ireland,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"had a fantastic stay here. great atmosphere, location, staff. right by the beach. you can rent bikes and surfboards from the hostel."
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,"great place to stay. friendly,helpful staff, comfortable, and great location on the hollywood walk of fame. no complaints "
Italy,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,8,8,"personale super disponibile e gentile. sempre pronto a dare informazioni, consigli e a risolvere problemi. sono stati carinissimi e hanno lavorato oltre l&amp;#39;orario previsto per aiutarci per un incidente che ci è capitato sulla walk of fame. insuperabili.  la location è perfetta, giusto sopra la walk of fame. consigliato.  "
England,Female,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great location, right in the middle of hollywood blvd (don&amp;#39;t expect a quiet night!). good breakfast and small but nice terrace area available. friendly staff who managed to let us have breakfast before the advertised time as we had to go early :)"
Indonesia,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,great location but it felt a little weird having a little girl (possibly a relative of the staff). there was also one 2 working plugs in a room of 4 right next to someone&amp;#39;s bed
Germany,Female,18-24,4.9,8,4,10,2,2,4,4,"all in all the stay was ok and the location is good to visit hollywood.but the kitchen isn&amp;#39;t really equipped, the wifi isn&amp;#39;t working and some things like passport, charger,... got &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34;. the baddest thing was, that there was only one accessible public bathroom with one shower, which was blocked almost the whole day. at the day of checkout i stored my luggage there and because i wasn&amp;#39;t able to take a shower in the morning, i asked to take one in the evening, they wanted to charge me 7$ f"
England,Female,18-24,5.7,6,4,8,4,6,4,8,"the hostel is in a good location, right on the hollywood walk of fame and really close to the metro station. we stayed for 4 nights and found the room clean, however, there was no air conditioning in the room, meaning we had to have the windows open (which didn&amp;#39;t actually shut). this also meant the noise from street made you feel like you were right on the street. ear plugs were a must. there was only 1 working fan in the room, which didn&amp;#39;t go far between 6 people in a small space. "
India,Male,41+,6.9,8,6,10,8,6,6,4,location was superb. other facilities were normal.
Mexico,Male,31-40,7.7,10,8,10,8,2,8,8,"what an awesome hostel right on the hollywood boulevard next to everything. very close to hollywood and highland red line station. had an amazing time. only problem was that manager was super rude came telling me that i had chosen the wrong room when it hadn't been my fault, then he took on reception girl right in front telling her how incompetent she was. what an a*hole. other than that, place is great. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,10,2,8,4,6,"best location, friendly staff , you get breakfast  , but the beds are bad and rooms are like sunna's "
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.6,8,8,10,4,6,6,4,"good location, condition is to be expected for the price. "
USA,Female,25-30,3.7,2,4,8,2,4,2,4,"this was the worst hostel experience i have had. the location is great for nightlife, and the woman that checked me out in the morning was helpful when i lost my phone. however, they were out of towels, the sheets did not seem clean, there was no ac (and it was extremely hot), so in order to have any air in the room, we had to keep the window open allowing the nightlife noises of hollywood boulevard into the room, making for a restless night. there are also no ladders to climb to the top bunks."
Australia,Male,18-24,5.4,6,6,8,4,2,4,8,"i am not one to rate accommodation poorly, but i had a poor hostel experience here. the staff were particularly rude and strange. there was 1 staff member who behaved so strangely i felt so uncomfortable. when he spoke to me, he had his hat brim low enough so we couldn&amp;#39;t make eye contact which was very off putting. moreover, i later saw him in the corridor, where he had a semi-erection and would shake his hips/junk around whilst on the phone. it was so bizarre - from a staff member! wtf!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,10,6,8,4,4,great location on hollywood boulevard. has a bit of a run down feeling to it. not sure if it&amp;#39;s just old or just not that clean. not a very social hostel - don&amp;#39;t stay here if your looking for friends/people to do stuff with. the beds were hard and squeaky. it was very loud at night but that&amp;#39;s to be expected. no air conditioning.  
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice staff, good location, include breakfast. the only downside is there is no parking around.  "
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,10,4,8,4,8,6,4,"nice enough. building and rooms were open to almost anyone, lock your bags. free breakfast was basic, location is why you stay here. you get what you pay for."
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,4,6,8,8,10,6,8,"a serviceable hostel option for the price. basic continental breakfast to get you started in the morning. bunk beds were very, very noisy and mattress was very old and not the most comfortable. location is great for several tourist activities. staff were kind and helpful. we were neither impressed nor disappointed with our stay. location probably adds $5 on what the hostel is actually worth a night."
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,10,6,10,6,8,6,6,"my stay was alright. all i can say is, location was great and the front desk that day i checked in. i probably would not stay again."
Mexico,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the best location in town, great value and aceptable facilities."
England,Female,18-24,5.4,4,4,10,2,4,8,6,"staff were rude and would not look me in the eye. wifi was so poor that a single web page wouldn&amp;#39;t even load, no matter where i was in the hostel. the room had a poor lock so could easily be entered by anyone, and the front of the hostel was only locked at night time, meaning anyone could come in whenever. there wasn&amp;#39;t any hot water for the first two days of my visit."
Vietnam,Female,25-30,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,"goood condition, recommend for staying"
Brazil,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,7.4,8,10,10,2,8,8,6,the place is okay for one night stand but i wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend for more than that. the shower in our room wasn&amp;#39;t working and they couldn&amp;#39;t fix it during our stay  and although they spend the whole day trying the situation wasn&amp;#39;t properly because our door stayed open all the time and we&amp;#39;re weren&amp;#39;t even there. the breakfast is simple but pretty good. the room smelled like cheap soap. 
Canada,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i always enjoy my stay at the hollywood and highland hostel when i come to los angeles.  the staff are always helpful and richard wants to make sure that you enjoyed your stay.  i highly recommend this hostel.
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,10,6,10,6,6,6,2,there is no parking except street parking. if you have a lot of valuables in your car i would not advise staying at this hostel with a car. probably not an issue for most people.
Netherlands,Female,25-30,5.7,6,4,8,4,8,4,6,"hostel is okay, but just a bit strange. everything looks messy (rooms, bedsheets, bathrooms). the staff was friendly, but the guy who checked me in was wearing his cap so low that i never saw his eyes when he spoke to me :| location is great: on hollywood blvd. there is nothing going on at the hostel (no planned events or activities )."
India,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,10,2,8,4,2,"firstly, the bathroom shower in my room was leaking and the staff wasn&amp;#39;t bothered to fix it. the room carpets weren&amp;#39;t clean. there weren&amp;#39;t enough kitchen utensils to cook, and the breakfast is not great either. they keep 2 or 3 cereals with milk. the breakfast buffet needs to improve immensely. the only good thing about this hostel is the location, right at hollywood boulevard(centre of tourist spots).   the staff is friendly, christine, reevaluate and richard in particular.   dissatisfied stay."
USA,Male,25-30,5.4,8,4,8,4,6,4,4,"unfortunately my stay here was not as well as i anticipated. to my dismay i discovered that there is no air conditioning, when i checked in at the office it was making me feel uncomfortable, because it was so hot in there. there was wifi, but there was terrible reception. i could not even get a signal in my room on occasion. multiple extension cords lay out on the floor which make it easy for someone to trip. perhaps a possible fire hazard with too many extension cords. security was ok. "
SaudiArabia,Male,25-30,4.6,4,6,8,4,2,2,6,"people who work at the office are the worst ever. they make any excuse to steal your deposit. last time, i left the hostel early morning and i gave the key and sheet. the guy told me to come back later to have my deposit. i came back after 1 week and i stayed their for 2 day, but when i asked them about my deposit they said because you left when the office was closed so no deposit!i spoke with the manager and he give it to me, but when i checked out at 10:40am they said you are late no deposit!!"
Ukraine,Female,18-24,4.9,4,2,10,4,6,6,2,"the hostel is very dirty and it smells horrible inside. security is awful! doors are not locked automatically and anyone can get into your room. besides that i paid for a room with 6 people in it. but the hostel was overbooked and the staff put an additional mattress in our room. so, there were 7 people. and it was a challenge for me to get my bed through the mattress and people&amp;#39;s suitcases. one plus here is the location "
Thailand,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,4,10,8,6,"the doorknob wasn&amp;#39;t reliable. there was no warm water. but the staff was very nice and the coffee tasted great. it&amp;#39;s the best coffee i&amp;#39;ve ever had, actually. and i&amp;#39;m grateful christine put me in 4-person room even though i paid for 6-person room."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice staff and guests.   will return soon!
Mexico,Male,31-40,4.9,6,6,8,4,4,2,4,"you get what you pay for, it's a seedy hostel in a seedy part of hollywood blvd... but for that price, it's hard to get better stuff. staff was friendly, but facilities were very basic. security is ok. "
England,Couple,25-30,3.7,2,2,8,4,4,4,2,"hostel/room were dusty, tired &amp; noisey. neither window in room locked &amp; would slide open (next to shared balcony so security risk). one had a blanket pinned up as a curtain, other nothing at all. door lock to the room was loose. bunk beds were incredibly squeaky &amp; unsteady. mattresses were stained &amp; pillows were flat. marks on linen. staff were abrupt &amp; strange. questioned us &amp; tried to belittle our answers. plastic cutlery/cups &amp; paper plates not eco friendly. would never return or recommend.  "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,3.7,4,4,10,2,2,2,2,staff didn&amp;#39;t seem amazingly helpful or knowledgeable. facilities were not particularly clean either. the upside was the convenient central hollywood location. 
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,8,6,i like it!!  cheaper than any other places on the same street.  people a re pretty funny and breakfast is good!!
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,4,8,10,4,8,6,6,"ok for a couple of nights but wouldn&amp;#39;t do a long stay here, not good enough for the price. staff are friendly but dorms are a bit iffy and smell weird, but great location right on hollywood boulevard across from the chinese theatre."
USA,Male,41+,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,i enjoyed my stay and will plan to stay their again.  great value in hollywood.
England,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"fantastic location on hollywood blvd, although there is a fair bit of shouting outside at night and only one window was double glazed, meaning we often got a nice narrative to sleep to! opposite a cvs pharmacy which has a decent selection of groceries and not too far from ralph&amp;#39;s on sunset blvd which is a good supermarket.    the staff were friendly, the room was an alright size with an en suite bathroom. the free breakfast selection was really good. would recommend!"
China,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"we just stayed here for one night, the location is good, you can take the metro and also bus easily, here if you need towel you need to pay $2. we have no schedule for next day, the staff there gave us good advises , and also told us the route in detail, she is nice, and my roommates are polite and nice. "
Israel,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the place is great ,cousy like home with very  kind  staff that gives you a good feeling.  the only thing i would have change is  the size of the lockers because a laptop can't fit inside and its very heavy to carry it during day while youre walking.  exept that everything was and still perfect  thanks a lot!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,4.6,4,4,10,6,2,2,4,non-respectful staff at the hostel turning the atmosphere of the hostel unconfortable
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,10,10,6,6,8,8,10,"we went to this hostel because of the low price. staff was pretty chill, not super interested in hanging out, but definitely not mean. right on hollywood blvd, which is great for sightseeing, but to us hollywood was a little trashy. we stayed near santa monica a lot w the bus. no free parking but you can stay at the orange for $15 a night. no curfew was great too, just make sure you make friends with your roommates before you come in at 2am! "
USA,Male,31-40,4.9,6,2,8,4,8,4,2,"the bed is bad, no locker in each room"
India,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,was a good overall experience. staff was very helpful. thank you for a good stay..
USA,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,6,10,8,8,the staff were really really friendly and very helpful. it was in such a good location you step out of the hostel and onto a star. the room was basic but what to be expected from a hostel. it was a really good price and prime location. i would definitely stay here again if i was in la for a couple of days. 
Brazil,Male,41+,6,8,2,10,6,6,4,6,"need security, many strange people rounding!"
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,"i just came from south east asia, staying in hostels that were 10 stars across the board for around $7 a night. the beds are already made upon arrival in se asia, which gives them all a hotel like feel. incredible atmospheres and very clean. so, comparing the value and quality i had down there to this place when i just arrived back in the states really gives h&amp;h a tough run. it was generally clean, staff was on site and helpful, tv room had a stack of dvd&amp;#39;s to watch and was usually quiet."
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,10,10,10,6,10,6,6,great value.
CzechRepublic,Male,25-30,5.4,6,4,10,4,6,4,4,"the hostel is in a very convenient location (close to many la attractions on the hollywood blvd) and it is quite cheap, however, you get what you pay for. i booked a 6-bed dorm, but was placed into an 8-bed one that smelled horribly - even the staff member himself told me that (and that i can ask to be moved to another room if it is too bad). the hostel does not have any kind of heating, so if you travel during winter, you will be very cold. the main door is always open all day (till late hours)"
Brazil,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,10,4,6,2,2,not a good place at all.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was very comfortable.  great shower   close to everything  perfect.  nice people  :)
USA,Male,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"two-words:   location &amp; affordability    pros:             rich, the senior manager at the property was a pleasure to work and conversate with. junior managers, were a hit or miss to talk to in terms of personality. the building is old, smells, but they do clean the entire property daily which was a suitable trade-off.    cons:             it's an old building and the rooms do have a  musty smell to them. the only other con imo was the janitor has a noticeable chip on his shoulder towards life."
Wales,Female,18-24,3.4,2,6,8,2,2,2,2,"the staff were very creepy, rude and annoying - the manager stares at you and peaks into your room when the doors open as well as talks a load of rubbish to you. sense the tone, if i'm not replying i don't want to talk now stop cornering me. it was intimidating &amp; they do not know how to treat customers / eachother. dirty, musty, broken down, horrible atmosphere like a murderer had been there, bathrooms = pure filth and would've been cleaner not using them ( could write more dont have space)"
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,probably my best stay in la. it is in hollywood which is great for sightseeing and such. staff was really helpful in setting up the amenities. 
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,i really enjoyed staying there.
England,Male,18-24,4.3,4,8,10,2,2,2,2,"most people stay one night that's what i recommend...the hostel is actually fine on the whole, but just seems a bit dodgy on entry. more than one staff member is hard to talk to and is awkward when asking any questions. location is brilliant but the hostel needs a lick of paint inside, the beds are pretty bad and the carpet is old and worn. no air conditioning is a bit annoying, they do have fans which help but isn't convenient. "
Taiwan,Female,18-24,3.4,2,4,6,2,4,4,2,horrible hostel .
SanMarino,Female,31-40,6,4,8,10,4,8,4,4,"nice and helpful staff and excellent location but... the rooms are really really small, no space for luggages and almost everything in the kitchen is disposable. that's the only think i really didn't like at all, no respect for the enviroment. it's not difficult or expensive to buy cuttlery and plates and to make guests washing them instead of producing everydays mountains of plastic. please think about it! love our planet!!"
Brazil,AllMaleGroup,31-40,7.1,6,6,10,6,8,8,6,"pros: location  cons: although the room have been cleaned every day, the room had a bed smell. there's no air conditioning so impossible to stay if the weather is hot."
Germany,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,10,8,8,6,4,the breakfast was good.  most of the staff was very very nice and absolutely comfortable to stay with. everything was easy and fast to deal with.  the location is very central but thats also why it can get loud at night.  all in all good job and a nice stay!
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,10,4,10,6,4,staff is really nice and kind .  but room is bad. too hot and bed makes noisy
England,Female,18-24,4.3,4,2,10,4,4,4,2,"the hostel was in a good location and that's about it. directly on the walk of fame however the door to the hostel was always left open allowing lots of people to just wander in, the handle to our door nearly off showing someone had tried to break it, very dirty facilities, breakfast stale however the staff were polite"
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,8,4,8,6,10,6,8,this hostel sits in the heart of hollywood and is well placed for exploring la. the staff were very courteous and waited up late to check us in when our bus was delayed passed midnight for which we were very grateful. the hostel was clean and had a basic kitchen with a small but cosy balcony for chilling out at night. students of music will love the beds as they share your love of making sound and will harmonize to any movement you make. the open staircase entrance is a bit of a security concern
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,6,6,6,8,"the location of this hostel was unreal, couldn't knock it at all. we were upgraded to an 8 person room with only my group of 5 boys in there with an air conditioner which was great.  downside was that the wifi was basically non-existent the whole time we were there and the towels/facilities needed an upgrade as they were well aged and shocking.  not bad overall but could be better"
Ireland,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,8,8,10,4,6,4,4,the location is amazing however our sheets and other linens were dirty. if you get your own room then it's fine but i don't how safe i would feel in a shared room. the staff are helpful.
Japan,Male,18-24,6,8,4,10,2,8,6,4,wi-fi doesn't work at all. my bed didn't have access to a plug.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i only spent one night there, but it was a nice, clean place and in a perfect location. staff was very nice and helpful. i definitely recommend this place."
Chile,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,4,8,6,6,there were no ac. it was hot as hell
Germany,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,8,4,"the location of the hostel is excellent! it's located directly at the hollywood blvd. so you are in the centre of one of the tourist spots of la. it's not very clean, but unless you're very fussy it should be ok for a few days. all in all the price is ok concerning the very good location."
Australia,Female,25-30,5.7,6,4,8,6,6,4,6,"this place was ok if you are just looking for a bed. it was clean and in a perfect location to get around with buses and the metro. the staff weren't very helpful with suggestions or directions, no info flyers in reception for trips or tours, and there is absolutely no air con in the rooms and it was unbearably hot that you couldn't sleep properly!! "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,6,6,6,8,4,8,4,6,the hostel had best location. but facility was terrible and old. stuff are good and kind. that's it. 
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,4,2,4,8,2,6,4,2,"the place was extremely dirty and the bathroom was something out of a saw movie. the beds moves uncontrollably whenever you moved, i was terrified it was going to break!!"
Brazil,Female,18-24,6,8,2,10,6,6,6,4,do not recommend! many of my stuff including food ans clothes were stolen from the room and no one from the staff cared about it
Chile,Male,31-40,2.9,2,2,6,2,4,2,2,"very small room, no electricity in the room, only one extension for the whole room. very hot, only one fan for the whole room. no security at all, they have only tiny locker, no bag can fit there, everyone can go into the hostel and into the rooms. old mattresses, dirty bathrooms, dirty reception. sum up, worse place that i have stayed. not recommended. don't stay there"
Australia,Female,18-24,6,6,8,10,2,6,4,6,"hostel had a weird vibe as soon as i arrived. it was more like a halfway house then a hostel really as seemed like a group of people lived there permanently. 'breakfast' was bread and jam.. not even margarine to go on the toast. staff were kind of rude and would come into rooms and ask for your name etc, without even introducing them self . also i think there was a child living there which was kind of weird.  rooms were unbearably hot.  good location though, right in the heart of things."
Germany,Female,18-24,6.9,8,6,10,6,6,8,4,"we enjoyed our stay at hollywood highland hostel, mostly because it's located directly at the walk of fame and the accessibility by metro and bus.  the one thing that was really disappointing though was the breakfast. if it says including breakfast on the website, we would expect a little more than just peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. the kitchen was too small for all the guests, too, so a lot of guests had to eat their breakfast standing.  overall good for the money, but room for improvement."
USA,Male,41+,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"gross facilities!  vulgar manager! he needs to be fired! kitchen and refrigerator, horribly gross! bad mistake to stay there! never ever again!"
Poland,Male,18-24,8.3,10,8,10,6,8,8,8,"if you're scroogy, go for it. you don't have to get up from your bed to see elvis rocking on the street. but you get what you pay for: 6 bed dorm was tight, airless (despite the fan) and loud (because of the fan). it was relatively clean, the staff was nice (even the infamous manager). don't forget to bring your own padlock (although you can buy one in liquor store downstairs)."
Austria,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"the hostel was nice for a few days and well located, just the breakfast could be a bit more variant with more options and better quality..."
Poland,Female,31-40,6.9,8,6,10,6,6,8,4,in general all was fine.some persons from the staff were really nice but 2 persons (out of 5 i met) behaved as if somebody forced them to work there.    manager - a really nice person in contrary to what i read before going there.
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,"very very good location and kind staff even there was  no elevator, staff helped me.  and room had has a bath room   price was also good"
England,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,"the hostel is in a good location for the hollywood blvd, and a great place to begin my trip in la."
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i really enjoy staying at the hollywood and highland hostel.  richard and his staff always make me feel like i am at home and welcome.  the atmosphere is friendly and the rooms clean.  i would highly recommend this hostel for any travelers in the los angeles area.
Netherlands,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"right on the hollywood stars walk, prime location. old building, quite a steep stairs, would not recommend with heavy luggage. door creaked very bad, but was oiled when i asked, great service. free breakfast is milk, bread and peanutbutter."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,8,10,10,"this hostel is great, right in the heart of hollywood boulevard! the room was clean and a good size. there are lockers available for valuables (you'll need your own padlock). the staff were really friendly and helpful and kindly let us store our bags the day we checked out (and use the locker too!). we only had one night so didn't really use the kitchen but it looked good and clean. the manager was a nice guy too. worth the slightly higher cost, would recommend."
England,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,6,8,4,6,"great location if you're looking to explore hollywood. i also walked to west hollywood in about 35 minutes (which in my opinion is a much better area to visit!)    the hostel is quite small and quiet, but for what i needed it for it was fine.there's a free breakfast (toast and peanut butter, but who's complaining) and the staff are pretty friendly.     only complaint is there isn't a room for bag holding, so i had to leave my bags in the office and at one point i saw the office unattended."
England,Female,25-30,8,8,6,10,8,8,8,8,"i stayed here for nearly 2 weeks. i would recommend it! ok its not a 5* hotel. its a hostel, which is way better value than a single room in a hotel. its very clean there are 2-3 staff cleaning for ages every morning. i did have some milk &amp; cereals go awol but this was not the establishments fault &amp; they were very apologetic about it. i would advise any guests to keep food that doesnt need refrigeration in their room! lovely staff. all so helpful &amp; sweet. excellent location with grocery nearby"
USA,Male,31-40,8.3,10,8,10,8,8,6,8,"been visiting and staying at this location for several years and it has actually improved. the hostel is cleaner, staff friendlier and the value is about the best one could get in hollywood."
Pakistan,Male,31-40,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"looks like you are in a ghetto. the staff will remind you that you made a big mistake, and now you pay for it."
Pakistan,Female,18-24,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the manager a black guy who is drunk every evening. keeps increasing rate and derogates/blames hostels world to be responsible of rates misquotes and mismanagment. the truth is they have no idea of what they are doing. anyone with a room and six bunkers doesnt become a dorm provider. do yourselves a favor, dont book here. stay sonewhere else as hollywood boulevard can be seen within few hours. not much to explore. "
Pakistan,Male,31-40,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,the african-american manager opresses his staff and in turn the staff mistreats. who gave them the license to be in hospitality business.
Pakistan,Male,31-40,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,hostels like these make the concept of hostels a failure. 
Armenia,Male,25-30,7.1,6,6,10,8,8,6,6,where do i start?! i wouldn't go there again! i wanted to stay in a hostel to meet travelers from around the world and...however it felt like a place for local low income people and...
Scotland,Male,18-24,8,10,6,10,8,6,8,8,we enjoyed our stay here. made the most of the fantastic location and nearby amenities. would recommend groups of 5/6 to this hostel to book out entire rooms for security purposes. otherwise great value for money!
France,Female,18-24,6.9,8,8,10,2,8,2,10,"too cold inside the room, bad windows!! room and bathroom very clean. bed not comfortable  very good location  nice and helpful workers"
Brazil,Male,18-24,4,8,2,8,2,4,2,2,it`'s a very good location and the money you pay to stay there is definitely low when compared to other hostels. but the facilities are very very poor and it's not clean at all.
Argentina,Female,25-30,6.6,6,6,10,6,6,6,6,"i didn't like that i had to make my own bed. also, i could never check out because there was nobody at the reception when i left."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,this place was great! it was the best location for people travelling. i would stay here again in a heart beat!
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,10,4,"super nice people, really helpful! location is perfect. "
Mexico,Couple,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, friendly staff. rooms should have heating for days as hot as the last weekend , we were sweating all night long."
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,6,4,10,8,6,6,4,"when we checked out of the hostel on 14th september, the member of staff was quite rude and direct wth us. there are better ways to wak with your guests. otherwise the stadd were fine and pretty friendly. the security isn't so good, the front door opens onto hollywood boulevard and is always open drng the day and we had a key for our room but could access it without the key. there are some small lockers available to use t store valuables. average breakfast provided of bread with pb&amp;j."
CzechRepublic,Female,25-30,6.9,8,4,10,8,4,8,6,"not that bad as in another reviews. and across the street is shopping mall where you can park for 8$ per day but if you stay there for 4 days and than you ""lose"" the parking ticket you will pay only for a lost ticket 8$. just my experince may be different at your time."
Australia,Couple,25-30,5.7,8,2,10,4,6,6,4,"perfect location, but there is no security at all. can't smoke anywhere inside the hostel and are forced out onto the street in the middle of the night at the mercy of hollywoods nightcrawlers. bathrooms are only in the rooms no communal one and not the cleanest.  "
Italy,Male,25-30,3.7,2,4,10,2,4,2,2,"weid staff, dirty and very old kitchen and bathrooms. the worst hostel i ever been. only the owner is a funny and polite guy"
NewZealand,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,4.9,4,6,10,4,4,4,2,"great location but the room was tiny for six people, not to mention very very warm with only a pathetic fan and tiny window for any kind of air. beds felt like you were sleeping at sea - very rocky and some were very squeaky.     the staff were unhelpful and not particularly welcoming, although did allow a refund for a member of our party who was unable to make it until the following evening.    everything was a bit run down and grubby, and there was a stale smell throughout the hostel."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great hostel in a great location, staff very helpful. groceries store below and opposite, everything located conviently"
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,4,10,6,8,"looks shabby--chipping paint, rusty/creaky beds/floors, few outlets &amp; only half of them work, flat pillows, no ac only fan that is still stuffy and they make you keep the windows open to the outside. security is iffy--they offer lockers in a common area, but you must provide a lock. the opening of the hostel onto the street immediately leads up to a long flight of stairs, (not secure if traveling alone with multiple bags as you have to leave one bag in the street while you haul the other up)"
England,Male,25-30,5.7,2,6,8,6,6,6,6,"so this review may seem a little unfair, however, this is due to receiving an email the day i was due to stay (in fairness it had been sent the night before but i'd had no internet) informing me they had overbooked and could no longer accommodate me and my friend. they did offer to refund my deposit, and suggested two other hostels that might have space, while this effort was appreciated, but to be honest, that just isn't good enough. looks to be a great location though as we drove past."
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,"unser aufenthalt war sehr gut man hat sich wohl gefühlt. die leute die dort gearbeitet haben waren sehr zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit! da man vom hostel direkt aif den hollywood blvd fallen kann war es aber auch sehr laut da man die fenster nicht schließen konnte, weil es so warm war. es waren aber in unserem 4 bett zimmer zwei ventilatoren vorhanden. die betten haben bisschen instabil gewirkt aber sie waren bequem! alles in allem n guter ort fur 1 - 2 nächte im verhältnis zum preis! "
Lithuania,Male,25-30,3.7,2,4,8,4,2,2,4,"we have spent three weeks traveling in 4 states and staying in many different places. but this one is definitely the worst ever. i regret that we decided to take this one in order to have a good location. much better option is to stay in some other areas in the city and then just come to this boulevard just for a short.     even though there was a breakfast included, everything in that kitchen looked disgusting, so we left to have breakfast somewhere else."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,8,8,10,6,4,6,6,"honestly as 2 chicks traveling together we were  little creeped out by the staff. there were a lot of inappropriate comments to the both of us which made us feel uncomfortable.    on a positive note it is in a fantastic location, rooms need aircon!"
France,Male,18-24,6,6,6,10,4,6,6,4,"rooms are really small, bathroom dirty, but the location is excellent."
Norway,Male,31-40,4.6,4,6,10,4,4,2,2," it was there, right on the hollywood bvd.when i first saw the entrance, i felt something was really wrong.i left my wife in the car and took my friend who drowe us to la, inside to check. the steps up to 2'nd floor looked like something from the red lite distrikt with it's red old carpet. when manager would have cash right away, i asked him to show us the room. the room was hot as hell, dirty underwear everywhere on  the floor, messy bed and a dirty towel over a clean bed. never again."
Ireland,AllMaleGroup,18-24,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,"by far the worst hostel i have ever stayed in. booked a 6 man dorm, we were put in a cramped 8 man dorm. the heat was horrendous. we had booked an ensuite, and while there was an ensuite attached to our rooom, it was shared with the entire hostel as we later discovered there were only two working showers in the entire place. above and beyond a disgrace, we would not recommend this kip to our worst enemies. while the location is excellent, this place is expensive for what you get."
England,Couple,18-24,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,the location is excellent although far from the airport. the facilities were limited and the lockers small. bathroom was nice though. to be honest you stay here for the location and its not a terrible hostel. no air conditioning.
Wales,MixedGroup,25-30,4,2,2,10,2,6,4,2,great location and staff were friendly but the rooms were very small with one small fan as air conditioning which was not very useful.  breakfast was terrible and kitchen felt dirty.   the bathroom was a state!!! i felt dirtier after i had showered. towels were also at an extra cost.  the atmosphere was strange. another couple staying in the same room actaully i quote said 'can you lock the door on your way out as theres a lot of weirdos around here' - sums it up!    would not stay here again.
Australia,Couple,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"staff is nice, dorms are good with a bathroom per dorm. great location.  the night i spent there was very hot though and there was no air con."
Norway,Male,31-40,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,"best thing about this place is its location, some dorm rooms are facing the busy street.  okay to stay for a few days.but there are better hostels in the neighborhood."
Canada,Male,18-24,6.3,4,6,10,6,6,6,6,"the hostel was ok. linens/pillows are old and should be replaced, and the best rocked and squeaked with even the slightest movement; that should be fixed.    we were happy with the washroom facilities! they were nice and clean/roomy."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"great place to begin an adventure. ours started here and we enjoyed every moment. the location is great and really accessible, especially if you want to venture out of hollywood and into la outskirts. the atmosphere was friendly and inviting, as well as the staff, with a huge shout out to the manager, richard, who was always willing to hang out and have a chat! all in all, our experience was great and had us referring to it as 'home'."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,5.1,6,6,8,2,6,4,4,the facilities was really bad. they said they offer breakfast but it's hardly to say breakfast. just bread and peanut butter.
Scotland,Female,18-24,6.9,8,4,8,8,8,6,6,"very basic hostel but you get what you pay for, no aircon in the rooms and no lockers in rooms (small valuables lockers in the hall though), they also don't have laundry facilities but there is a launderette nearby.really good location  and the staff were friendly, i left too early to take advantage of the free breakfast. if your main concern is location then this hostel is great, close to the subway (connects to the flyaway bus which takes you straight to lax) and its on the walk of fame."
India,Male,25-30,3.1,2,2,10,2,2,2,2,"i was there for 3 nights.   horrible hostel stay and worst time.   very shaky, dangerous and very noisy bunker beds.   room was so damn hot. dirty walls.   staffs werent a bit helpful for anything, and had a bad attitude as if they are paying us to stay there.  in short, i recommend to stay here only for its location, which is right on hollywood blvd and hollywood's attraction. but for everything else, i donot recommend this hostel to anyone, and definitely not value for money."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,6.6,8,4,8,6,8,2,10,"the hostel was very clean and tidy which is great. the other great thing was the en suite bathroom. the downsides are that unfortunately a lot of sketchy people hang out around the front of the hostel and the front door only gets locked late at night so they could easily just walk in. make sure you bring a padlock to lock your valuables away. other downside is that there is zero atmosphere, there are tiny communal areas which nobody seems to use. overall though it's pretty good value for money"
Colombia,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,"beds are not the best, specially if you have the upper ones."
Germany,Couple,25-30,6,6,8,6,6,6,4,6,"located on hollywood blvd. very noisy all nights, small rooms and a lot of weired people here. staff were ok but apart from that couldnt say too many good things. if you want to stay in hollywood and need a place to sleep its ok i guess, but not more. "
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,great location on hollywood blvd. staff were fantastic and really helpful. highly recommend!
England,Female,18-24,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,10,8,"the staff were really great and helpful, alex and richard in particular. they had a free bbq one day which was amazing - even had homemade burgers and salad! the only thing i would say is the rooms are so tiny we couldn't really fit our stuff in but it didn't bother us too much. the location is ideal right on hollywood boulevard and opposite fresh and easy."
Australia,Male,25-30,8,8,10,8,8,8,6,8,"i found the hostel good value for money, the rooms were a little small for my liking it was a little squashy in there at times. a part from that the staff were great and very helpful."
Australia,Female,25-30,6,6,6,10,2,8,4,6,at least a ceiling fan in the bedrooms/ some aircon would be good. my room was full and all bar one checked out the next morning because of the heat.
USA,Couple,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,6,8,"the location and price can't be beat for staying in la, you are right on hollywood blvd a stones throw away from the chinese theater and right out front there is a taxi waiting area as well as a bus stop making getting around a breeze. "
Brazil,Couple,18-24,8.9,10,4,10,10,8,10,10,the only thing i hate the most is that in my stay of 5 days the wi fi never worked! but in general the place is great and the location too and the staff was very nice! i totally recommend!
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,8,6,"great location, in the heart of hollywood. friendly staff too maybe just needs better kitchen facilities. overall a great hostel to stay at"
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,6,2,10,6,10,10,10,super friendly staff! 
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"great hostel,  awesome staff,  excellent location! it's quiet, not a party hostel (the one down the road is), but friendly atmosphere,  basic brekky,  and good value."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,6,10,10,8,"super nice staffs, excellent location, two thumbs up, highly recommended "
Argentina,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,10,8,8,8,the best place to stay in hollywood. good charge per room and it has toilet in each room. it is locate a couple street to principal metro station and the best place to visit it is so close from the hostel. good staff. i recommend to you.
Malaysia,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,8,6,the location is just super strategic. that's what you pay for. it wasn't super clean but is ok. at least i'm relieve when i know i'm staying there right in the middle of hollywood. 
Brazil,Female,18-24,6.9,8,8,10,8,6,6,2,"dirty, dirty!!!  but perfect location..  so i would come back!!!"
HongKong,Male,31-40,6.3,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,"basic provisions for a clean, tidy stay"
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,8,4,6,6,4,"the room was small and shabby. only one electric outlet for 4 people. although it looked clean, it smelled something bad and shared kitchen was so dirty that i never used it."
Germany,Male,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,8,6,"great location! of course, you cannot expect anything fancy for such a low price, but i came late in the night for sleeping and left early in the morning, so it was totally fine for me."
England,Female,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,6,10,8,10,"perfect location right on the hollywood blvd, and really helpful, friendly staff including the manager also met other lovely travellers too, ended up extending my stay twice :)"
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,10,10,6,6,i really enjoyed my la travel with highland hostel. its location was great! also staffs are so kind. and i could eat breakfast like toast with peanut butter and jelly with milk. its cost was reasonable :-) i really love this hostel.
Ireland,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,10,8,8,6,6,it didnt advertise air-con for our room so i shouldn't complain but it really is difficult to sleep in the heat without it. so we had to open a window but it was bit loud outside. bunk beds a bit squeaky.
Germany,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,4,10,8,8,"first of all, the location is perfect. it is directly ocated at the walk of fame. the staff is freindly and helpful.   for breakfast you will get toast, peanutbutter, jam and coffe.the rooms are small but clean.unfortunetly they don´t have airconditioners so that it gets hot in the rooms.  there is a cheap way getting from the airpot to the hostel by public transport. take free shuttle to bus station and then 2 other buses ( look up on goolge maps).   in general we had a great time at this hostel."
Australia,Female,31-40,7.1,8,6,10,6,6,8,6,"staff were nice except one woman who was very abrupt. it was a fantastic location, right in the thick of things, especially at night. hollywood boulevard is cheesily cool. and its not too far from the sunset strip either."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.3,6,4,10,4,6,8,6,"good location, but not much else is good about the place"
France,Female,18-24,7.4,8,6,10,6,8,10,4,"we had a great time there. marcus, the responsible, was so nice! people there were funny and cool. the breakfast was simple but good. facilities were not modern but we didn't care. we couldn't have a better location ! "
Canada,Male,25-30,4,2,4,8,4,6,2,2,wouldn't recommend staying here... very sketchy.  breakfast was a joke  seems like a high school students apartment with lots of bunk beds
USA,Male,31-40,4.9,4,4,4,8,8,2,4,"bad, some street dude made siren noises outside the place till like 5am. the room was way too small and overcrowded, 4 bunk beds in one room. there is a shower in the room, and everyone stunk to high hell. check out is at 10am, and it is impossible to get any rest. i booked 3 days and stayed one. "
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"very good hostel , which is run very well. staff are all really really kind and welcoming and professional at the same time. "
Germany,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,totally ok for that price. the entrance is right on the walk of fame with nice view on the hollywood scenery.  für den preis absolut ok. der eingang befindet sich auf dem walk of fame mit blick auf die hollywood szene.
CzechRepublic,Male,18-24,5.7,6,4,10,4,6,4,6,it's pretty much just place to stay over night. if you're alone it's really hard to find someone to travel and explore with because there's no gather room. everything is about average except for location.
Sweden,Male,31-40,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,6,6,it's a good location on hollywood blvd. relatively small rooms and the lack of power outlets made it sometimes hard to keep your electronics charged.
USA,Female,18-24,5.4,4,6,8,6,6,4,4,"this place is right on hollywood avenue. the only good thing is the transportation. it is very close to a metro rail station. however, it is really noisy and the surrounding place of bed is dirty. the bed is uncomfortable and you have to pay if you want to have blankets."
Mexico,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,6,10,10,"location is amazing, very accesible by bus or metro.   the hostel is clean, they clean everyday and eventhough it is a little bit old, it feels clean. the restrooms are very good.  the breakfast is very poor, but i didn't expected much, it would be nice to add maybe some cereal.  some of the staff is very friendly, however there are some who exploded easily. they seemed to always have a problem with some clients, and even though the problems were simple, they made a big deal out of it."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"no complaints. however, if you're more chill and laid back, this location is not for you. i ended up leaving the day i arrived and going to the samesun hostel at venice beach, but that is just because hollywood wasn't my style. the guy at the front desk was really kind and helpful and the room was fine. from what i experienced, it was a great place, just not for me because it's in the middle of hollywood :)"
USA,Female,31-40,5.7,6,4,8,6,6,6,4,"need to enforce house rules. i was in a girls only dorm and there were guys hanging out in the room in the middle of the night. also, the door on the room did not automatically lock and the drunk guests would come in and leave the door unlocked for anyone to walk in. i awoke to a guy wandering  looking for his shoes."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,10,6,6,"for the price this hostel was fine. the staff were friendly and i had stuffed up my booking and they helped me out which was really nice. the hostel itself is quite dated and the interior is quite ordinary but the bathrooms were clean and i didn't feel like it was dirty, just old. the common room was quite small and crowded most of the time but it was fine. the location is one of the best you'll get if you want to see hollywood!"
England,Couple,25-30,5.1,6,6,8,6,4,4,2,note to anyone staying here: make sure you check out on time! there is an extremly rude woman(maybe the owner or manager) who shouts at everyone at 9.45 to get out. the rooms arn't very clean- and neither are the matresses. its a good location being near the walk of fame etc.... but thats all your paying for.
China,Female,18-24,4,2,6,8,2,2,2,6,"poor beds shaking a lot. small kitchen, no laundry, no luggage storage. wait for 1 hour for checking in."
China,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,6.3,6,8,10,4,4,6,6,"the first day we arrived, we were waiting in the office to check in. and the boss came in said 'you ladies please step out for a while, we had something to deal with'. ok, we waited outside for a long time!!! we are customers!! how can you let us go out and wait for your doing your so call 'thing'!  except for the location, i dont like this hostel, kitchen is poor and breakfast is just so so."
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,"i have to say the location made the hostel pretty great. it's right on hollywood and a few steps away is chuck norris' star! they do the best they can with what they have. it is hard to find a place for a hostel in that area. the staff was helpful and they had a few different places to hang out which was nice! i would've like a better ""breakfast"". it's a pretty small place, but i enjoyed my stay there!"
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,7.1,6,6,10,8,8,6,6,"an alright place in a very good location, central hollywood. breakfast is very basic, essentially it's just bread, butter and jam/jelly. lots of colorful characters around"
England,Female,25-30,6.9,8,4,10,4,6,8,8,"only one electrical outlet in a dorm room, which you had to cross over someone's bed to get to. they should provide extension cords for this.  also, a male staff member stayed in the female dorm for all the nights that i was there, which made it really uncomfortable, especially when there was only one bathroom in the room so you would have to wait til it was free to get change. although he might have been there on invitation, it should be a rule that this is not allowed to happen.  "
Australia,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"the staff were friendly and helpful. rooms were serviced each day and breakfast available daily. internet connection good. they are still upgrading and renovating, but ensure that everything is running smoothly."
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,6,6,10,8,4,10,8,the location is great you are on the strip and you are close by to lots of restaurants and action. the beds were really springy and the rooms are old. the people staying there were awesome. it's a fun place but it wasn't worth the money but again the location was awesome.
Vietnam,Male,25-30,7.1,8,6,10,6,8,6,6,"the location of this hostel is great, just a few minutes away to many point of interests in hollywood area. i think they need to clean the rooms a bit."
Canada,Female,18-24,5.1,4,4,10,4,6,6,2,"great location on hollywood blvd. rooms and kitchen dirty, no activities. too expensive for what you get.."
Austria,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,10,6,10,4,4,"not a great hostel, the room was stinky and dirty, the common rooms weren't nice, location is good (right next to dolby theater). the staff was incredible, i met 3 different people who worked there and all of them were super friendly and helped me with all my questions. they made my time in la much easier"
Brazil,Male,25-30,3.7,2,2,10,2,4,4,2,"i have difficult to feel safe, to find a plug, to use the internet... many things.  the location is perfect if you want to know hollywood. but i think the price is too high if you compare with other hostels in other places, but bettter quality"
Russia,Female,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,8,10,8,8,i'm really enjoyed my stay in h
Egypt,Male,25-30,4.6,4,2,10,4,6,4,2,"i didn't even check-in. it's not clean at all and the lockers are tiny, they don't even fit a 13 inch laptop!!!! they didn't even accept 100$ bills, i'm glad they didn't because this gave me time to think that in really shouldn't be checking-in."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.4,4,8,10,4,4,2,6,"the place was cramped, great location, but the staff could be a little bit more relaxed..  rooms were a lot smaller than usual and the bathrooms were a little gross ( wearing flip flops recommended)..."
Australia,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,great location easy going staff would stay again
Ireland,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,6,6,"great location if you want to stay in hollywood. the manager is welcoming. supermarket across the road and hollywood and highland metro stop nearby. bring earplugs due to location. free breakfast of bread and spreads is always handy. small kitchen if you need to cook, tv room and outside space, small lockers available in the hallway, bring a padlock. rooms are a bit dingy but saying that it is the same with the majority of american hostels, or if you're used to australian hostels you'll be fine."
Argentina,Male,25-30,6.9,8,6,8,6,8,6,6,it's ok for the price. good location as far as hollywood goes
Australia,Male,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,10,6,6,the staff were some of the nicest people i met whilst in la. it was incredibly cheap and had a great location. the only negatives were the atmosphere and the lack of activities the hostel provided. overall though i did enjoy it and would recommend it
France,Female,18-24,6.6,4,6,10,4,10,8,4,"average hostel. the staff is made of really nice and friendly people and the hostel is located in the hollywood boulevard so it is very convenient. however, the hostel is very old and needs to be renovated (no air conditionning, small beds). the kitchen is not very convenient if you want to make your own cooking."
Australia,Female,18-24,7.7,6,6,10,8,8,8,8,"i can live with pb&amp;j.   this is a very small hostel in the heart of hollywood blvd. i discovered that i'm not a fan of hollywood, or la when i got there, but the owner, staff (who live there), the residents, and other travellers made my visit to la. for those needing parking, you can park securely and cheaply in the hollywood &amp; highland centre as long as you validate your ticket at their info centre. i recommend pay a few more dollars for female dorm which has been renovated."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the staff were very accommodating. richard, the manager, was friendly and informing."
Netherlands,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"especially the location if this hostel in amazing. the renovated rooms are really good, and it is definitely value for money. "
Colombia,Female,18-24,7.1,8,4,10,6,8,8,6,"the hostel is located in hollywood boulevard which is great if you want to be there, breakfast is a joke is peanut butter and jelly every day with the worst coffee ever, staff is nice they are try to make people comfortable instead the hostel is not what people expect to see, but it works if you are just looking for a place to sleep..."
Canada,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,hollywood and highland hostel has all brand new plush carpeting in each room.  the walls have also been freshly painted.  the staff treat you like family and that is why i always stay at hollywood and highland.  they have a spacious kitchen and an outdoor patio for people who want to chill and relax. richard is the manager and he will do everything he can to make your stay pleasant.  i highly recommend staying at hollywood and highland.
Australia,Female,25-30,3.4,2,2,8,2,6,2,2,"definitely not worth $30 each a night!! shower so mouldy, pillows stained brown from people sweating on them, they looked at least 15 years old! front door doesn't lock properly. wouldn't stay here again!"
Israel,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,6,10,8,6,"although the facilities and cleaniness were just ok we had a very good experience and will definitely recommend it, because of the awesome location and mainly because of the awesome staff- we were always greated with a smile and when we asked for recommendations of stuff to do in la he took the time to write down a whole itinerary for us!"
NewZealand,MixedGroup,18-24,4.6,4,4,10,4,4,2,4,people were very weird. kind of scary. didn't really want to stay that long and it felt unsafe. would recommend to stay somewhere else
Singapore,MixedGroup,18-24,6,6,4,10,6,8,4,4,"the location is really good as it is right at hollywood. however, the beds are dirty, and the room is really small. there's no fan nor aircon, and the window doesn't allow much ventilation."
USA,Male,41+,8,10,6,10,8,6,8,8,the staff should be friendlier!
England,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,8,8,8,2,"great location, great staff, decent breakfast - pity the bathrooms, plug sockets and light switches were disgustingly dirty, i didn't want to switch the light on or off in the dorm, for fear of catching a disease!   there's another hostel a few doors down for the same price, much cleaner but less character, depends whether you just want a bed for the night in the best location, really."
Austria,Couple,25-30,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,10,6,"this hostel is direct on the walk of fame which is pretty cool! so the location is excellent. the staff were also very friendly. could be a bit more cleaner, but its really ok for the price. i would stay there again. only thing i didnt like was that                    you have to pay for using the computer. but i think thats everywhere so in la."
USA,Female,25-30,2.9,2,2,8,2,2,2,2,"this place was a nightmare and should not be on any hostel sites! it is a locals hotel for drifters. it had filthy floors, stained matresses, no security, and lots of shady characters. there was a prostitute in my room working hollywood blvd. nights and sleeping all day!!! stay away!"
Russia,Female,,4.6,2,4,10,2,8,4,2,terrible!  бомжатник!
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,6,6,10,6,8,6,6,"this hostel is directly on the hollywood boulevard, just a 2 minutes walk away from the chinese theater, madame tussauds,.... that's awesome. the staff is nice, too and there is a tv room and a kitchen as well.  the rooms aren't the nicest, but if you're staying in hollywood, it won't really matter because most of the time, you're outside."
Malaysia,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,10,4,10,6,2,"the room were a bit dirty(in terms of dusty) &amp; the carpets seemed like it was not vacuumed. there was a bit of a weird smell in the room as well. the toilets, some of it were not functioning properly. but the staff were very friendly, excellent service."
Australia,Female,18-24,3.7,4,4,6,4,4,2,2,the bathrooms were mouldy and didnt have any toilet paper. the whole place smelt disgusting and the rooms were pretty average. if youre just looking for a cheap stay for one night then maybe but otherwise i would give it a big miss!
Belgium,Male,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"nice hostel in the middle of hollywood, great staff"
Hungary,MixedGroup,18-24,4.3,0,4,8,0,4,6,2,"if you don't want to spend much, for one night it is ok, but not for more."
Scotland,Male,25-30,7,0,6,10,0,6,6,6,excellent location on holywood boulevard
Germany,Male,25-30,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,6,8,"when you want to be in hollywood but have a tight budget, this is the place. the staff is very cool. the bathrooms are pretty done, some leaking tabs, need definitely to be renovated but hot water runs. the kitchen is very small but in general sufficient. for a couple of days it's good."
USA,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,best best best!
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,0,6,10,0,8,4,4,"very good location and free breakfast. i met weird people here, but that´s not hostel´s problem."
Denmark,Male,18-24,7,0,6,10,0,10,6,2,"the staff was awesome! cool area, but they could really use an air-conditions system."
France,Male,18-24,4.7,0,6,6,0,2,8,2,"if you want to be in hollywood, why not. but honestly one of the dirtiest hostels in california."
England,Female,18-24,9,0,8,10,0,10,10,6,"brilliant atmosphere, great location and the staff were really nice!"
Germany,Male,18-24,4.3,0,6,10,0,4,2,2,"great spot! but horrible rooms. if you'e looking just for a ""room"" to sleep - you'll be ok (bring your own sheets!!). the location is great. become a hostel for tourist and not for a plaxe for home-less like people to stay; get some color in the rooms and at least some curtains for the windows. this caused me to cancel  two of my three nights."
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,3.3,0,4,6,0,2,4,2,"this hostel is so messy, dirty and i find the rooms disgusting. the rates are expensive and we had the feeling, that the staff is trying to soak us and another group of travellers up.  the only advantage is the location on the hollywood blvd. but there are cheaper and better possibilities to stay in la. take the other hostel two blocks down the hollywood blvd. its clean, not as expensive as this hostel and it has a nice staff."
Australia,Male,18-24,5,0,2,8,0,8,4,2,very loud rooms being right on the hollywood boulevard. little to no socialising area. dirty and smelly but in a very good location. i would choose the one down the road. no ladies for fun time
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place to stay. it was close to everything and the staff was very friendly. when i come back to los angeles i will stay there again. 10s across the board!
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,great place!! mike and natalie made me feel at home. chill laid back place. i will stay there again☺
Mexico,Male,31-40,6.9,4,8,8,8,8,6,6,"the information of payment is $25 us plus tax ($2.4) the cover $30 us per night, the information of payment should it be more clear in the site. la it's to expensive, so is good deal to stay there for $25 (plus tax) every night."
USA,Female,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"don't bother staying here, the woman who runs it is extremely unprofessional and very sketchy. if you do decide to stay here, get ready to have your privacy invaded by the owner as she grills you on your mental health. if you do have any sort of mental health condition, she will flat out deny you being able to stay there and will try to forcibly throw you out. she apparently has no idea about disability laws. "
Spain,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,"great staff and atmosphere, well connected via metro to the sights and downtown of the city. totally worth for what it costs!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,i am a young african american woman who tried this for the very first time.  they where really nice!  i would go to them again! just make sure you pay for your stay in cash and show them your plane ticket or however you got there ticket. for 7 night i payed them up front $175 and that's it! i plan to stay there again when i go apartment hunting! 
Ireland,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"we stayed one night at the lovely timen's house. the staff were very welcoming and ensured that our stay was pleasant. the location of the hostel was great and close to public transport links. the rooms were clean, air conditioned and there was kitchen facilities available. the hosts were kind enough to allow us to leave our luggage with them after we had checked out. we would not hesitate to return. "
Canada,Couple,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"reserved but arrived and decided not to check in.....  this is just a house in a semi sketchy area, no hostel signage  the people who own it were really shady when i asked if they lived there, the shadiness and the fact that they only accept cash makes me think they're not operating legally.  they were also rude  "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this was my sixth hostel stay experience and i have to say that timens house made it into my top 2 rather quickly. i love love love, the type of residents that this particular hostel attracts and the owners are incredibly hospitable. there sense of humor was definitely a bonus lol. the only downside was the wait time to use the bathroom and the fact that there wasn't a washer on site. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at timens and i'm quite certain that it'll be my first choice next time i visit l.a"
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,4,8,6,6,2,2,6,this hostel only accepts cash and will charge you  $5 extra a night if you're american. at the time i booked that information was not online. the owner got very angry when i brought this up and told me i could go to another hostel. my recommendation is that everyone should just go to another hostel. 
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very clean.  owners nice and helpful.  do not trust all the reviewd from other people.  it's very pleasant.
USA,Male,31-40,3.4,2,2,6,2,6,4,2,"this place was not clean at all! i understand, respect&amp; get the reasons why people who have to stay there do but....i couldn't even stay there   unhappy to say that i was unhappy with the place."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,a decent place to stay. local to a main train and bus station. mike and natalia are attentive hosts.  i would stay again.
USA,Female,41+,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"they refused to let me in. the man on the phone was quite rude and challenging despite that i paid for the stay.  ""you should read everything ... try to find any hostel that will agree to take you in.."" well, i went to another hostel and it was all cool.  also, i am going to check with the aclu if you can bar guests of a certain age.  based on my experience, find another place to stay."
Germany,Female,41+,6.3,6,8,8,2,10,4,6,"natalie is super nice.. but having to come up with $25 in cash was confusing, as i thought i could pay by card and should have only had $22 left after having paid a $3 deposit online.     all rooms are through-rooms, which means you have to walk through a dorm to either get to another room and/or to the bathroom and/or kitchen. it keeps disturbing people and the already limited privacy becomes an issue. people arriving at all hours (1 am &amp; 5:20 am) did not make it any better."
Netherlands,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"dear reader,    i stayed at timen's house for 10 days and enjoyed a great stay. michael and natalia are excellent people and helpful. also made some great friends from different parts of the united states and the world.    kind regards,    brian "
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,lovely caring owners and nice room mates. amenities close by and tube station ten mins walk away. would stay again :).
Italy,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,6,6,10,10,8,"good place to stay. cleaned enough, quite place, good connections to public transports and downtown. take cash to pay the host because the property do not accept credit cards."
Australia,Couple,31-40,6.6,8,8,4,8,6,4,8,"not really worth it.     it is clean and has a kitchen and a tv, wifi and a hot shower.   but it is located in a random neighbourhood far away from anything you want to see. there is mainly long term residents rather than travellers. most are nice but there is an old lunatic in the main dorm who will get in ur space. on arrival the owners quizzed us if we had bed bugs which was awkward. they said they accept credit card, but they don't when you get there, so we had to walk to an atm."
Brazil,Male,18-24,6.3,6,4,6,8,8,4,8,"bathroom was weird with conjunction on other room. that's not a hostel for travelers, there was actually normal people living there."
Spain,Male,41+,3.4,4,6,2,4,2,2,4,"hard to understand the hospitality in this house. i was pushed to use their own tumble dryer in order to decontaminate my clothes, obviously under my own cost. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a great location, a walk away from local metro rail red line that stops in hollywood and gets there fast.  a good price with cable tv in all rooms. it is cleaned everyday, friendly staff. i would recommend and will come again."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i would recommend this location for travelers looking to enjoy the la experience while having the convinience of a hostel that feels like home. the timen's were very accommodating and made me feel at home on their property. from check in, i was welcomed by the owners who were very friendly and who accommodated me with a bed that was priced higher than what i had reserved online, just to make me feel at home. the facilities were well kept and offered everything you need for a comfortable stay. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"always love staying at the timen's house. its definitely an affordable way to visit hollywood.  also safe, clean, and fun.  the owners live on site and manage the property.  they are both very nice and respectful. the property is cleaned daily and has lockers where you can lock up your items while being out.  its about a 7-10 min walk to the north hollywood red line station.  talk about convince, no need to hassle with ubers or renting a car.  also all residents are super friendly and fun!!! "
Brazil,Male,25-30,2.9,6,2,2,4,2,2,2,"seriously, this is not a hostel. most people there are locals who lives there. the neighborhood is terrible and not safe and far from anything. the place is really dirty. and the staff, well... there is this couple who manages the place, they are extremely rude and when anything goes just a little different from what they expected they get really angry (i was just asking questions...), very impolite. anyway, stay away from this place, really."
Australia,Male,31-40,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"this is a warning, whatever you do, do not stay here!! 1. it's not a safe environment. 2.it's not an actual hostel, it's more a half-way house. locals appear to be living there. 3. the ukrainian couple who own the place are rude/ aggressive. when i checked in she refused to subtract the hworld deposit and still charged me the full rate. 4. i complained and she started shouting/swearing at me. 5. no day storage when ch/out"
Netherlands,Female,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,6,8,"the staff was really nice and the facilities ar alright. however, it was not really a hostel, there were a couple of people living there. overall an ok hostel. "
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my stay at the timens house was amazing!  the hostel is located very close to the north hollywood train and bus station which is very convient.  the owners mike and natalie are both very polite and accommodating.  the hostel includes shower, a towel, a kitchen, fridge, tv with many channels (hbo included), bed, and even a pillow! lockerspace is available to secure belongings.  and the people i stayed with are all very friendly and inviting.  there&amp;#39;s no way to beat the value anywhere else!  "
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the timen&amp;#39;s house was a great place to stay. the staff was always friendly and the bedrooms and bathrooms were extremely clean. the timen&amp;#39;s are doing a great job keeping the place clean and safe for their travelers.  the location of the hostel is great, and is walking distance from the subway station and great coffee shops and eateries. the timen&amp;#39;s overall have a great hostel."
Brazil,Female,25-30,5.4,6,8,6,6,4,4,4,great location near to universal studios and metro line however i found the opening hours for check in and questions from 10am to 10pm not very appropriated. staff were friendly however not very flexible or helpful. the place is very clean however blanket was smelling a bit and the place had some maintenance problems. 
Italy,Male,31-40,3.7,4,8,6,2,2,2,2,very bad! don't go
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel ever so nice and clean, friendly and best of all cheap....420 friendly and fun.....quiet....nice guests and staff"
France,Male,18-24,4.3,4,6,4,2,6,4,4,"i felt insecure in your hostel. i won't recommend it. pple are not travelers they're staying on the long run, this is no hostel. the way the rooms are displayed is really bad. pple are forced to go through other rooms to access theirs or facilities. it's bothersome and feels insecure. lockers in other people's rooms is more than deplorable too. on top of that, there is a bunk bed in the kitchen and only 1 bathroom! show more respect for your guests. plus you ""scammed"" me 60$, consciously or not."
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,10,8,8,6,8,8,6,great value. thanks for your hospitality mike!
Brazil,Male,18-24,2.6,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,"it was the worst hostel i have ever been, everything was looking unclean and it has a really bad atmosphere! the first advise that the owner gave to us was how to react if the police approach us and that we shouldn't go out with a knife but use a bottle instead in case of trouble... lol  also the owner's wife was insulting us for no reason, i guess she didn't like the fact that we were from brazil.  we paid but we didn't stay there, we left without asking for our money back."
China,Male,18-24,6,6,8,8,6,4,4,6,"if you are looking for a cheap place to sleep for the night in hollywood area, you have found it. however, if you are looking for more than that i would not recommend you to bother to book this hostel. make sure you are arrived on time. i meant on time. otherwise the owner would sell your bed to others without notice you. these ukrainian couples could be very mean and showing bad attitudes toward travelers/guests. and you will not meet other travelers as most of people are long-time residence."
Mexico,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,the managers were very nice and the hosts also!
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,"nice cozy place. there were no travellers there though. just locals that were on long term stays. anyway, a nice chill atmosphere with friendly people all around. really enjoyed the stay. the neighborhood itself isn&amp;#39;t too great and i wouldn&amp;#39;t advise going around too late into the night. the metro station is fairly close (10-15min walk) and it&amp;#39;s near hollywood so if you wanna tour there it&amp;#39;s a good place to stay. would recommend to others wanting affordable accomodation. "
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,8,10,6,8,8,10,10,"i'll be honest, the only issue is the location. however,  this problem is from the city. la nothing is close, if you rent a car ok, you can find any place just to sleep. otherwise, if you want to use a public transportation or bike, find a place close to santa monica or tourist places."
Australia,Male,31-40,8,10,8,8,6,8,8,8,nice and pleasant stay. good location friendly staff
Denmark,Male,41+,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,"nice enough place, more of a long term dorm feel to it. lots of pot being smoked. people were okay, though."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,convenient location. walkable to metro station and laundromat. thousands of tv channels plus satellite radio in every room. cleaned every afternoon.   
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,6,10,"natasha and michael were awesome! they are a beautiful ukrainian couple. very friendly and helpful. a girl got her money stolen from a regular guest. so make sure you lock your bags and take your wallet with you everywhere. very good price, and pretty good location, near  a lot of food places. would definitely stay again.v"

Russia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this is not hostel,this is paradise."
Canada,Male,25-30,4,2,4,8,2,8,2,2,"i've been to a few hostels and this is by far the worse. in fact its not even a hostel really just a house with as many bunk beds they can cram into a living area (including the kitchen) as they can. we booked for two people and were told after we had paid them that we'd be separated into different areas. people there were nice, owners were nice as well, but overall it was a pretty horrible experience. i wasn't expecting much from a hostel but this was well below expectations. not worth it"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the absolute best experience i've had in a hostel! i've never worried about myself or my things, definitely stop by if you're in la!"
Germany,MixedGroup,25-30,3.7,2,4,6,4,6,2,2,"the owner told us never to leave our belongings out of sight, as the place is full of weirdos hanging out and smoking all day. most of them seemed to be long-term tenants. however, at least the neighborhood seemed safe... timen and his wife are really friendly and welcoming, but alas the place is suffering from bad management. the facilities (including mattress and bedsheets) were really dirty. i would not recommend this hostel, even if you're on a budget."
Germany,Male,25-30,4.6,4,8,6,2,6,4,2,"the place is cheap, but very dirty. the whole estate is weird. all rooms are connected and some people where sleeping in a bunk in the kitchen."
China,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this hostel is horrible!!!!!!!!!  the description on website is nothing match with reality! they are big liar!!!!  and the hostel owner even threaten me for cancellation!!!!!  and the place around the hostel is very very very dangerous!!!!!  if you want to be safe, do not book this hostel, this place the worst experience that i've ever had!!!!!!! i ran away and booked another motel even though the house owner won't let me cancel the reservation, then you can image how bad the situation is."
Italy,MixedGroup,25-30,2.9,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,"despite our booking and reservation via hostelworld, we were greeted by a lady only to tell us that there was no such reservation and therefore we had no place to sleep in los angeles. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,it is a very good hostel. i would recommend it to anyone that is visiting the area. the owners are very kind and accommodating.
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,"the people who stay here are mostly long timers, not too many travelers.  i had a bunkmate who was having a feud with the landlord when i arrived.  not the vibe i was looking 4. there's a tv in each room, which i don't like.  the rooms are interconnected so even though it says you have a room with 4 beds, there's people from other rooms walking in your ""room"" since your room could be a living room or the kitchen. i'm surprised they didn't make a closet a room.  as they say, u get what you pay 4."
NewZealand,Male,41+,9.4,10,6,10,10,10,10,10,"the service whilest at timens was xtremely good an very loyal an helpful when need be. the only issue was smoking/weed an occasional dis-appearing money an minor things. other was an awesome an relaxing place, close by with plenty in hollywood too do"
China,Male,41+,5.1,4,10,6,4,4,4,4,"tv in the room, you cannot sleep well , somebody watch tv in the early morning.  you can not go in , wait out for half hour, no body in the office to open the gate.  no gas to boil water, no microwave."
Denmark,Male,41+,4.9,6,4,6,4,6,4,4,"it was an odd mix of fellow dwellers, with a strange mood in the house."
Denmark,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,2.6,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,scary people and didn't live up to the deals we made. tough neighborhood.
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place! mike and his wife run a fun, relaxed, clean, comfortable house...great location, great people! book now, cuz this place is hot!!!"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,6,8,6,4,6,6,6,6,cheapest place we could find - so pretty much as expected. bit lacking in bathrooms and not terribly clean - but absolutely fine if you're just passing through. bit of a hike from the metro.
Slovakia,Male,18-24,5.4,6,2,8,2,8,4,8,"first of all, this isn't really a hostel, it's simply a house with many bunk beds (including in the kitchen). they willingly leave people to smoke weed in the backyard and none of the doors are ever locked. literally anyone from the street can walk up to your bed without a problem. the bathroom was clean and shower was very nice, but you share this with 12 people. there isn't an option of a check-in past 10pm, so if you arrive late - tough luck! the neighborhood is dodgy! owners are very nice!"
Mexico,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"when i arrived to the hostel around 10pm, they told be that all the reservation where cancel and the place was full. they didnt let me use internet to find a place."
France,Couple,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"we booked a dormitory at timen's house for 3 days. we also received a confirmation. at the airport we called from the information centre to this hostel to see how we could get there with public transport. on the telephone we had a person, very rude and very impolite. she said that our booking was cancelled. and that was it. we called again to see what went wrong, to sort it out, with the confirmation number in our hand, but no, no discussion. now were waiting for hostelworld to refund our money."
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"my stay at the timen house was really awesome!  the owner and his wife are super nice people and the place itself is really chill.  it was a good atmosphere throughout plus it's in a good spot to where you can walk to everything.   they had a beautiful garden full of apple trees and orange trees that we picked and ate fresh!  i really enjoyed the stay, two thumbs up!!"
Slovakia,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is my first time staying here, my experience was pleasant. i am a smoker and the owner of the hostel has provided a dedicated smoking area, as well as non smoking areas. the kitchen and bathroom facilities are adequate, and the hosts provide bedding and towels. there are tvs in every room for those who like tv. recommended for other travellers looking for a cheap, quiet place to stay."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"timen's house hostel is conveniently located in north hollywood near two trains and several bus routes.  it only took me 15 - 20 min to take the train to the hollywood blvd strip and 30 - 35 min to downtown.  the staff is very friendly and made me feel welcome like if i was at home.  there was no curfew or period of time in which i was required to be out of the facility, unlike some other hostels in the los angeles county area.  i plan on staying here again the next time i visit los angeles."
Australia,Female,41+,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,8,6,affordable accommodation near a reasonable walk from north hollywood train station. good hearted owners made me feel welcome and met a number of lovely and interesting guests. louise
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"good spot walking distance from the north hollywood metro station (a short ride from hollywood) and the noho arts district. the people are friendly, the facilities adequate, with air conditioning, and tvs in every bedroom. overall, a relaxing environment, and a good spot for your stay in la."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my best stay in la ever. excellent hostile, very clean environment. very secure. the owners work very hard to keep the riff raff out. everyone here was so nice and polite. fully functioning kitchen. sparkling bathrooms. large new tv's, dish network. fast wifi. if you are going to stay in la, this is definitely the place you want to stay."
Russia,Male,31-40,4.6,2,6,8,2,6,6,2,"bed bugs, stay away from that place."
China,Male,25-30,4.9,6,4,8,2,6,6,2,"other than good location, everything seems poor. the first nite i arrive, the 4 bed room was overbooked and i was changed to 10 bed room which was terrible."
France,Male,25-30,5.4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,"nice hosts, but as someone said, it's more a place where they use a part of their house to get backpackers than an hostel. i didn't have a good feeling about this stay but maybe it's me.    pretty clean, just found one cockroach on the kitchen and a another one on the restroom.    so same story, if you are looking for a cheap place, that's work."
Germany,Male,18-24,2.6,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,"there is not much to add than this: the money is invested in all but the hostel. in almos every room there were cockroaches and bugs. the owner seems to be nice, but is a perfidious man, trying to take every dollar out of your pocket that he can. stuff are getting stolen there weekly. so security is a foreign word for them.  all i have to say: try to avoid this hostel. even though it is cheap, it is stil not worth it. there are better alternatives."
Netherlands,MixedGroup,18-24,5.4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,"i would recommend staying there only if you have hardly any money left for housing. the hostess was very kind and friendly! but i did not liked the host that much, he was a bit rude. furthermore they do mix up the female dorm with man, so future guests if you have a problem with that you should look for something else. also there are some guests there who are staying there for a long time. the floor is old, so if you wake up early other guests complain that you are making to much noise."
France,Male,18-24,6.9,8,8,8,4,6,8,6,"a good place in terms of price/place. more like a private place with bed to rent and facilities. it just don't look like a youth hostel so if you want to be in a ""traditional"" youth hostel this is not the place. but, if you want a cheap bed somewhere in la, with normal convenience and stuff, this is the place."
USA,Female,31-40,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,bedbugs!!!!! my stay was 3 days 
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was very pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed staying at this hostel. the owners natalie and mike are incredibly kind and generous people. the people that stay there are quite friendly and fun to hang out with. because of the location's proximity to hollywood  there are all sorts of interesting actors
Scotland,Female,18-24,6,6,6,10,6,4,4,6,"a cool welcome on arrival in the middle of the night, bunk-beds in the kitchen and no living space."
USA,Male,18-24,6.9,8,6,6,8,8,6,6,really good stay. the owners have great character too.
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,wonderful place and people
Ukraine,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,10,8,"we lived in this hostel only two days,but was satisfied  with everything.stuff was very nice and friendly(moreover they speak russian and  as we speak too ,it was very comfortable for as). location is really not bad,only 10 min. to get to hollywood.kitchen,bathroom -everything is clean and adequately."
England,Female,31-40,4,6,4,2,4,4,4,4,"- location did not feel safe, especially at night.   - staff made me feel like i was inconveniencing them, even when asking simple questions.   -room layout poor - you have to pass through another dormitory to get to your own or go to shower/bathroom.  th"
Norway,Female,18-24,2.6,2,2,2,2,6,2,2,we booked a 4 bed dorm for girls only but got put into seperate rooms. 2 of us got put into the kitchen and the other in a room with ladys that lived in the hostel that were fighting all the time. no security facilities available. the location was dodgy and unsafe. i do not reccomend this hostel to anyone.
Scotland,Male,41+,8,6,8,8,6,10,10,8,not so much a travelers hostel as a boarding place. wonderfully friendly and helpful hosts with hard working staff in a home environment. could do with more privacy with the bathroom and shower facilities but it has all the things you need. my stop there was fine for airport and beaches as long as you had a car though traffic in la is probably the worst i experienced in my 5 week road trip. too little public transport in that place to make it fun to experience.
France,Male,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"really nice place, everybody friendly. if you need anything, the owners can help you. really cool atmosphere. beautiful place to stay."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"very nice couple managing this guest house in north hollywood, they are friendly and always ready when you need them for anything at all. friendly hostel, for those who like animals they even have a cat maggie that comes in from time to time. lovely places, with a warm and friendly atmosphere and good value for money."
Poland,Female,18-24,4.9,8,2,6,4,8,2,4,there was some difficulties to find the hostel. room wasn't secure at all. we supposed to be in female room... that turns out to be a mix room without any notice. it didn't feel like hostel at all. the location is good only if you willing to visit universal studio or wb studio.
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,4,4,8,4,2,2,6,2,it's not a hostel.. it's just house.. they were selling a bed    it was very dirty toilet and kitchen and so on..     do not recommand.. but cheap..  and if u pay by credit card .. they need extra money...  $5 more..        it was bad experience.. no way....
Taiwan,Male,25-30,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,great hostel   great staffs  great foods  great time to staying there!
USA,Male,41+,9,0,8,8,0,10,10,10,i had a great time at timen house. the staff overseen by michael and his wife make the place very comfortable. the facility is clean and people are friendly. the location is close to know public transport and freeways. all the basics of home are there. its a cool place to stay.
USA,Female,25-30,4.3,0,4,4,0,6,2,6,this is not regular hostel. it´s more place for people with regular job. during my stay over there i met 90% people who work (or pretend they do) in the city. and it was no sign for hostel. i asked across the street one women where on this street is hostel and she said that here is nothing like it. when i checked the street numbers i found out that i was standing in the front of hostel from opposite site.
Germany,Female,18-24,8,0,4,10,0,10,8,8,"staff was friendly. room was clean and absolutely ok and so was the bathroom. security was unfortunately  poor as door isnt locked(nothing got stolen surprisingly though). usually friendly people staying there but awesome price gives you a wide range of individuals. location is pretty good if you buy a metro pass for ony 5dollar/day. price/quality of hostel is awesome, so recommended!"
Japan,Female,18-24,7.1,8,4,4,8,10,8,8,there was very good place to make friend i really enjoyed my stay.

USA,Female,18-24,10,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,"great hostel and staff, about a 10 min walk to the metro station, very close to hollywood!"
USA,Male,41+,8.7,0,10,8,0,10,6,10,timen's house is within easy walking distance of the red line from union station and is easy to find. the area is a bit rough looking but i walked around the area late at night and had no problem (of course use common sense). upon my arrival one of the staff provided me with clean linens for the bed. i found the living areas to be clean and the other visitors were all very personable. i only stayed one night (other plans) but i slept well and would stay again. overall great for a cheap hostel
NewZealand,Male,31-40,7.3,0,6,8,0,6,8,8,"nothing flash, but it is a good place to sleep in an area where most accomodation is expensive."
Switzerland,Male,18-24,4.7,0,4,8,0,4,2,6,very unfriendly and disrespectful roommate!
USA,Female,25-30,2.3,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,"i was the only one in the entire female only facility. the dorms are all separate from each other. there's no real communal feel. there was a spider in my bed, a moth under my sheets, a spider above my bed and a spider below my bed. i felt unsafe given my dorm was all the way n the back in an area that's completely remote. the door to my building was left open and unlocked. i expressed my concerns to the woman at the front desk who gave me an extremely nasty attitude. do not stay here!"
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,10,8,nice quite area. the park next to it provides a nice view to the sea. the private room i got had old side louver windows (rectangular pieces). i could not shut it. it was stuck and broken.
USA,Female,41+,8.6,10,10,4,10,8,10,8,"first trip to this hostel.  if you don't have a car it is a little difficult to get to and it is out of the way from local grocery stores.  nice place, too bad it is not open longer."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.6,6,8,4,8,8,4,8,"a little jail-like but fine for a nights stay. very far out from the action which was ok for us given we had a car, but wouldn't recommend if you don't plan in having a vehicle to get around. not a viney hostel, more on the quiet side "
NewZealand,Female,31-40,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"i loved the hi south bay! it was exactly what i was looking for - a cosy, quiet spot where i would be able to sleep in the dorm at night without people coming in at all hours. i met some great people, and the views over the bay are spectacular. not for people looking for somewhere close to la or a party hostel and would definitely recommend having a car here as it is about a 20 minute walk to the nearest bus stop."
England,Male,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"if you're looking for a relaxed hostel that's cheap and near a beach this is for you.    if your looking for a party hostel and to meet and drink with new people, this is not for you.   "

USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fantastic    what a lovely place to stay it should be open year-round
China,Female,31-40,3.4,2,2,2,2,6,4,6,"we regret a lot to have stayed there. it was not telling the truth in its introductions - no wifi in the dorm room, only in the lounge at rather low speed. it takes you at least 20 min walk to eat anything, if you don't drive, not even a 7-11 around you. i tried to save money by living there, but it cost me over 100$ with uber since the place is so far from anywhere to visit, no public transpotation nearby. more to tell just no space. don't come."
Ireland,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean, cost efficient, near to bus facilities to take you downtown la and located next to nice views and cabrillo beach."

Hungary,Couple,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"that was my best accommodation ever. the view was spectacular and breathtaking, beautiful place. it doesn't matter that the hostel is far from the city center because of the view. the rooms were super clean and the staff was really nice, just like the people who stay there. the breakfast was self serviced pancake mix, toasts and oats. i highly recommend this place for everyone. it was really friendly.

Germany,Female,41+,5.4,4,8,8,4,6,4,4,"the furnisher is old and unpleasant. my bed was hard as if i was sleeping on a table, covered with a thin matratc top.  there is no dishwasher. when each person washes its own plate more water will be wasted than by using a dishwasher. some guests just put dirty plates in the sink and leave the kitchen a mess.  internet is very weak and only to use in the common room, often breaks up.  sink in bathroom +wc old with build-up of dirt.  door to room a only to open with strong kick  poor breakfast ..."
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,8,10,8,10,"the view from this location is amazing! a car is definitely a must if you're going to be staying here as this will facilitate moving around the area. i only stayed there for one night, but from what i was able to capture, it's a magnificent place near the la region where one can totally zen out and relax. would definitely stay here again! =)"
England,Male,18-24,5.7,4,10,2,8,6,2,8,not in a great location at all and dorms have few facilities considering over 20 people share 2 toilets. is in a beautiful spot however so come here if you want a quiet few days away from the hustle and bustle of la
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,10,6,8,10,8,8,"there wasn't too much to do around this area, but the place was clean for a hostel and the staff was very friendly. great for a 1-2 night stay!"
Scotland,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,8,8,6,6,"was told that i had to pay an extra 3 dollars per night because i didn't have a hostelling international card, wouldn't have stayed here if i'd known that. they changed bed sheets but the floor was never cleaned, pretty much covered in sand the whole time. i wouldn't recommend staying here if you're planning on exploring la tourist hot spots because it's veeery far away and not any cheaper than other good options."
USA,Male,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,staff was very helpful and nice. the location is not very ideal. pretty far away from the la people want to see. but it was a quiet affordable place to stay
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,8,4,4,8,8,4,4,the staff was friendly. the surrounding was not the best! it was trash bags stacked up outside the building. the parking was very limited. however it was cost efficient. 
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"the view is stunning, beds are clean, rooms are small. there is only one shower for all the rooms, but it was not ever occupied when i needed it. overall was a nice experience, but i could hear everything going on in the hall ways. the doors had a space underneath them that allowed for sound to travel. however, most people were in bed and sleeping by 10pm so it was not a big deal. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"mubfirst time in a hostel was a pleasant one. comfortable room, kitchen for cooking, and laundry services were awesome. highly recommend this place!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,"great experience! first time staying at a hostel, and i&amp;#39;m so glad i gave it a try. "
England,AllMaleGroup,18-24,7.1,10,6,4,6,8,6,10,chill hostel with pretty location but very far from the la you&amp;#39;ll want to see as a tourist. an uber to venice beach will cost around $40.
Malaysia,Female,25-30,5.1,6,6,4,2,6,6,6,no wifi in dorms - only the main building which is far from the dorms. 
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,great place to stay. the park behind the hostel has an amazing view!
Ireland,Female,18-24,4.6,6,4,2,6,4,4,6,myself and two friends stayed here and didn&amp;#39;t really look into the location before booking. it was very cheap and basically you pay for what you get. if you are planning on the la setting close to tourist attractions and in general close to anything do not stay here. it is a good hour out of the city and inconvenient. if you have a car this might have been easier. very different from the hi hostels that we have stayed in on the east coast 
Australia,Couple,25-30,6,8,6,4,6,6,6,6,"we have been to heaps of hi hostels and all were rad. this place is not friendly, warm or in a good spot. only good points are it's cheap, there's a decent kitchen and a tv room. there's no vibe and nothing to do in the area. note: you will need a car to get to shops/bars whatever. there's nothing close at all. the staff were ok, one of them just spent the whole time on the phone looking for other jobs. mattresses were really uncomfortable. also you can't drink... period :( "
NewZealand,Male,18-24,6.9,6,6,4,8,10,6,8,helpful and friendly staff but not the ideal location and some of the guests were a bit weird
Chile,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i haven&amp;#39;t felt this peace and relax since many years ago, i&amp;#39;m very lazy but this hostel made me recover my self, i even went to run in the morning. however, if you are planning to party and meet people, this is not your place, this hostel is like a summer camp for people who want to relax, it&amp;#39;s located in a beautiful cliff with an amazing view to the ocean. staff is unbelievable nice, beside a nice breakfast there is also free food (sometimes), just help your self. very clean and 100% amenities "
Croatia,Male,31-40,6.6,6,8,4,6,10,4,8,"the location is bad if you don&amp;#39;t have your own car (if you want connection with los angeles). you can walk around for 2-3 days, check the beach and the pacific coast.  there were many bad guests in the hostel: very noisy at night, sitting on the sink (most likely druged) etc.  two roommates didn&amp;#39;t care to be extremly noisy at 7 am, one even agressive."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,4,10,"staff were warm and helpful, really appreciated the free pancake breakfast. facilities are clean and well maintained. had an amazing view out to the water.    cons i guess would be that the wi-fi can&amp;#39;t reach the women&amp;#39;s dorm, so we could only really check the internet in the common building. also there weren&amp;#39;t many people around interested in chatting and making friends, but i guess that&amp;#39;s not the hostels fault.    overall, lovely clean hostel that i&amp;#39;d recommend to people wanting a chill"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"amazing place, shame about the slow bus and giant hill, but worth it! "
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,4,10,6,8,6,8,"staff was friendlier than most hostels. everything was clean for the most part. most other guests polite. only thing that sucks was they had a plumbing issue the morning i was heading out, but they sent maintenance to fix it quickly. great spot by cabrillo beach."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,8,10,"it was very clean and the staff was very helpful and was willing to change reservation mistake i made online. the kitchen was better than you would find at any hotel with real clean utensils. my only small quibble is that the front desk did not give out info on hostels for someone who hasn&amp;#39;t been to one right away, but that&amp;#39;should not a huge deal. i recommend it."
Canada,Female,31-40,8,10,6,6,8,10,8,8,"this is an out-of-the-way hostel that was very quiet - good for introverts, not so much for partiers. it was perfect for me as a transit point to/from catalina island.  there&amp;#39;s a nice park with great views nearby. there were only a handful of other travellers staying at the place, which made me worry a bit about security since the park next door has some sketchy people around.  free breakfast was good.  i&amp;#39;d stay here again."
CzechRepublic,Male,31-40,8.3,8,6,8,8,10,8,10,"if you want to visit la, venice, santa monica, then it's far way (2 hrs to la downtown). good just if you want to relax out of the city. accommodation is decent and staff friendly. "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,6,8,10,8,10,great place to relax! bit out of the way if your wanting to explore la tho. staff were really friendly! dorm rooms were clean and the free parking was good they shut a gate and a security guy drives laps around the park all night so if you&amp;#39;ve got a vehicle it&amp;#39;s pretty safe! met some nice people there! also some nights they put on a dinner for a small donation and the free breakky was great! 
Canada,Female,25-30,6,4,8,4,4,8,6,8,"the way they promoted this place was misleading. san pedro is next to the ocean, but the hostel itself is quite far away from the water.e it is an old military style barrack. sounds cool, but wifi was only accessible from the main area and there was only 1 bathroom per barrack (which has 30 beds). they also advertise nightlife entertainment but do not allow alcohol in the hostel (not said in their description). good for families and quiet groups, not for others though. overall i'm disappointed."
Australia,Male,31-40,6.3,8,8,2,8,8,2,8,it's out of the way.. it's clean and comfortable.
Canada,Male,41+,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,bathrooms should have locks on doors. a couple walked in on me while i was showering.  should be more showers as it took a long time to get one at times. we only used hot water tap.   so both hot and cold water taps would be better if they were working.  
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,my stay here was a very good arrangement as i was there for just a couple of days to getaway. everyone was friendly and helpful. although there was an overall consensus  about a large group of french teens that were too noisy and very loud at night and early morning. besides this factor my stay was pleasant.  
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,this was my first time staying in a hostel and loved it! my girl and i were transferring to california and needed a place to stay until our home was available. 
Panama,Male,25-30,6.3,8,4,6,6,10,6,4,"my pro's: friendly, upbeat, welcoming front desk staff     my con's: location very from los angeles on the metro and difficult too arrive too by metro.                  very dark and inadequately lighted area after sunset.                   thieves, thieves ate my food the night before departing and the person had no consideration to open my package food and leave it in the cabinet with there nasty fingers on it.                    upon my 2 night my bed was occupied had to sleep in the library"
Zimbabwe,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,4,10,10,8,10,"great hostel, the staff were really friendly and helpful. only thing is it was far away from downtown la. the bus to the hostel runs infrequently. everything else was great."
England,Female,18-24,7.7,10,10,8,6,4,8,8,"staff upon check in made me feel like i had significantly inconvenienced her and interrupted her day. location is quite remote but once you arrive there is a beach and a grossery store withing walking distance. on the whole, a nice stay!  "
England,Female,18-24,8.3,8,10,4,8,10,8,10,"this hostel is really lovely, it's just extremely far from central la. staff were great."
England,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,nice place stay a from chaos of la
NewZealand,Female,31-40,5.7,6,8,2,4,6,6,8,"perhaps it's because the us isn't geared towards backpacking, but it found it dreary and old, averagely maintained, and way out in the 'burbs away from any form of shops, including decent supermakets, restaurants, etc.  probably wouldn't stay here again."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very friendly staff....amazing location overseeing the ocean. the food was great due to the holiday - breakfast options are good.
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"a lovely place in a nice neighborhood. the staff are friendly and helpful, the common areas and rooms were clean and the view is pretty! the location is not so good, but nothing that can't be solved if you have a car or don't mind taking the bus."
Austria,Male,18-24,6.9,8,10,2,8,6,6,8,hostel is nice/ employees are friendly / location is horrible/ tool me 3 h to go there from union station
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"if you're looking for a busy party place that shouldn't be your first choice, but if you want to have a chilled and relaxed time this hostel is perfect! guests and staff are very friendly, can't complain about my stay, really enjoyed it! only, if you drive, you should get a car during your stay..."
USA,Male,41+,9.1,6,10,8,10,10,10,10,nice and quiet and peaceful which is what i was looking for.  i stayed here last year also.  it was a welcome respite from the traffic and throngs of people in la.
England,Male,31-40,6,6,8,6,4,6,4,8,"this hostel is in a lovely area, on a hill overlooking the pacific. however, there are no local facilities so you will be entirely reliant on buses/cycles/car to get around. everything was nice enough, but nothing special either. clearly one for those that want some quiet time rather than a party as you won't find one here. also, the wifi was intermittent during my stay and cod only be accessed in the main reception/kitchen and not in the seperate accommodation buildings; a major frustration!"
Canada,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,8,10,"a great hostel if you have a car (which is much more important for la than any other big city).  my window overlooked the friendship bell and the ocean!   quiet place to sleep, clean rooms and sheets, clean bathroom.  highly recommended."
Australia,Male,41+,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"this is a great hostel in a good location. clean and quiet. along way from hollywood, venice etc, so you need a car.  there is a deli and cafe near by but a supermarket is several miles away"
Belgium,MixedGroup,25-30,6.3,6,8,6,6,8,4,6,"if you have a car, this location is ok! about 30min from la downtown. we felt a bit like on a scouting camp because of the building!   for european norms this is quite expensive and the wifi is not that good."
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,10,8,8,8,"for the price, this was a pretty nice hostel. i've never stayed in one that was so open. it's 32 bunks all in the same room. there are no doors between the beds and the lobby, so i expected it to be pretty noisy at night. they do a great job of implementing quiet hours though so it turned out not to be a problem. they also have earplugs which was really nice. you get a towel to use during the stay. only bad thing i'd say is the bathroom.. mold on shower doors was pretty gross."
SouthKorea,Female,25-30,2.3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,"i booked a 6mix dorm. but there were only 3bed! (no dorm. no room. just have 3bed. like a studio) in addition they've got a double booking!! so staff said, ""you can use the bed only first day. a rest of day you have to use a folding cot. and if you want to cancel, you'll do it."" at that time, i was very confused. and then that was about 7:30pm! so i had to find another hostel... it's too awful!!!"
England,Male,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,6,10,"cool hostel in great location, good facilities and a great guy in charge. very small and very quiet though. "
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,6,10,10,10,10,10,it's the coolest hostel i have ever stayed 
Finland,Male,31-40,4.3,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,not a usual hostel. like a big room workshop and sleeping area by night.
Philippines,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i'd highly recommend staying in podshare. place was really nice and accessible, location is just a 10 min walk from the metro. "
USA,Male,25-30,4.6,2,6,6,2,8,2,6,"this is probably the worst hostel you will have ever been to. granted the overall quality of hostels in the united states is significantly lower than the rest of the world, you will feel disgusting after staying here. did i mention it's next to impossible find? "
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,6,4,8,4,8,6,8,"pros: the place looks cool, the top bunk provides some privacy, there is communal food, the pods have a personal powerstrip, the staff is nice. cons: the picture shows multiple pods, but there are only two pods, a loft, and three roll out cots in 1 big room at cosmo st, only one bathroom, the door to the street stays open until 10, the pods are next to that door so its hard to get comfy before 10, there was only a tv in the top pod and netflix wasn&amp;#39;t hooked up as stated, &amp; bottom bunk had no tv."
Colombia,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,6,10,"super small hostel, 6 or 7 beds, but very well located. everything is new and everything is in a single space: beds, kitchen, reception, dinning room... i booked a pod, but i stayed on a rolling bed that is set at 10pm and is removed at 1030 am (they only charged me $30). not for people that are looking for privacy. large dining tables and good wifi that are perfec for working on your labtop."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome stay, staff is awesome it couldn&amp;#39;t have been any better"
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,"the place was nice and chill, and the location is good for people who wants to stay in downtown la.  the only downside i can think of is that considering the way the room and the beds are set up.. i just think $50 is a bit overpriced."
Ireland,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,8,10,10,6,excellent location and the staff are great.  especially that girl from new zealand who's name escapes me!  the only thing i wasn't impressed with was the approximate 30% extra i was required to pay which i was told is city tax.  surely this could be made clear from the start.  so i payed usd40 instead of the usd30 hostel world told me i needed to pay on arrival.
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved my stay at podshare chill atmosphere and friendly staff who recomend some great places to eat
Sweden,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,"our group of four european college exchange students stayed just one night at podshare but really want to come back when in la next time. the staff was really nice, welcoming and service-minded. the entire place had a very fresh, youthful vibe to it and there was a clever technical solution for everything from payments to giving information on who is in each ""pod"". the pods where very cosy and comfortable! location and standard pushes up the price a bit, but definitely worth it!"
NewZealand,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,8,10,10,overall a good experience! location was great! 
BritishIndianOceanTerritory,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,4,6,8,8,they only problem with podshare is that it only has one toilet for ten guests.
England,Male,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,6,10,6,8,"podshare is in a great location in central hollywood, just around the corner from hollywood boulevard. the hostel itself is a pretty cool idea; in your 'pod' you have everything you might need - plugs, headphones, tv, lamp etc and then you share food/ books etc. the only negative is there is only one bathroom. the best bit about podshare is definitely the staff - the owner elvira was really welcoming and full of useful tips on where to go and what to see. i would definitely recommend a stay!"
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"absolutely loved staying here! great way to meet new people! staff were amazing, excellent location. i could not recommend it enough, would stay here again in a heart beat!"
Netherlands,AllMaleGroup,18-24,6.9,6,6,8,6,8,6,8,"good location, good service, quite average rooms and ok people."
HongKong,Female,25-30,5.7,6,4,6,6,8,6,4,"i am very sorry to leave a negative review because it was truly a mismatch of expectation.   the location and staff were fine. it took only like 10 mins walk from metro, and the staff were nice enough to talk to.  but, it looked totally different from online advertisement, and the place we stayed was actually a staff accommodation area. the hostelworld indicated 24 hours for cancellation policy, yet podshare said it would be 48 hours on their side. pretty disappointed out of this confusion."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,podshare is an incredible experience that i wholeheartedly recommend. the staff are extremely friendly and go out of their way to make sure your stay in la is as good as it can be. the location is also fantastic and the facilities are among the best i have experienced.
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"staying at podshare was my first ever experience at a backpackers anywhere in the world and i'm normally more of the 'hotel' type on vacation. so i have no means for comparison however i certainly enjoyed my stay there and would definitely recommend it for any single travelers or anyone looking for something a bit cheaper than a hotel. from what i know/have heard about other backpackers, podshare is very different but in a good way. would recommend to anyone who asked and a great host!! "
England,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"a great concept. the location was fantastic and the staff very friendly. the facilities were generally good with things like hair straightners, shampoo, computers, tv, wifi etc. there were plenty of cereals for breakfast. the pods were very comfy though inevitably it wasn't the quietest place to sleep. my only qualm would be the bathroom. on the night i stayed there were two extra people sleeping on roll out beds on the floor which meant 10 people for one bathroom (combined shower and toilet)."
Australia,Couple,25-30,4.3,2,6,6,2,4,2,8,"we have stayed in hostels worldwide and this has to be one of the worst! multiple issues with this hostel that includes; the whole of the window isn't covered by curtain, so very bright, very early, the pods/bathroom/kitchen aren't separate rooms so you can hear everybody's everything, include the idiots who showered every night at 4am- thanks for that, not!, and the staff couldn't have more lack of info of the area if they tried. it is also in an area that feels unsafe. "
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"even tho i didn't spend much time at the hostel, the manager and her staff were extremely polite and inviting. location is a less than 5 min walk from the metro station. abundant restaurants, shopping, tourist attractions nearby. bed was very comfortable and the fact they're not bunk beds makes it more convenient! there are power outlets located everywhere in the building! again didn't spend much time to take full advantage of the place but i'm definitely coming back the next time i stay in la!"
Australia,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,10,10,6,8,"amazing facilities! the hostel can be whatever you make it to be, whether you want to make new friends or just to relax by yourself in your amazing pod! the staff were all exceptionally friendly, and fantastic free amenities like wifi, bathroom products, tea/coffee, fruit made the higher price worth it. i stayed there when i had one night in la by myself, which was a perfect choice, but it's not a party hostel whatsoever, nor do they run nightly events."
Brazil,Male,31-40,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice place, people and concept, but they must take care about facilities mantainance. my reading light was broken and the same for the tv of another pod. wi-fi is included but poor quality almost impossible to get connect to the internet."
India,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"wonderful location, staff and concept. love the spacious pods with their inbuilt tv's, and basically all that's been done with the limited space (only 10 pods on this unit). good kitchen, bathroom, computer facilities etc. would love to see cleaner bathrooms (although still clean) and i think the guests need to do what's required to clean up after they're done. very upbeat atmosphere with the aspiring actors etc."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"the staff was extremely nice and i really can't think of anything i didn't like about this place. the best ""hostel"" i've seen so far."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,highly recommended. good location. staff nice and helpful.   would add access to second bathroom if possible.
England,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,"really friendly staff, great atmosphere and great location. i'll be coming back."
Canada,Female,31-40,6.3,6,4,8,6,8,6,6,"i have stayed in many hostels throughout europe and north america. in a typical hostel, you have rooms for people to sleep in and a separate common area. that's not the case at the podshare as it is open concept. last night, they had karaoke so i had to deal with extremely loud music and drunk people badly singing until well after midnight. again, you can hear everything from the common area from your bunk as it is open concept.     i was booked in for three nights but left after the first night. the other "
Turkey,Male,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,10,8,perfect for a peaceful stay. no need for any other words.
England,Male,25-30,6.9,8,4,8,6,8,6,8,not enough bathroom facilities. security a bit suspect. location right by walk of fame and metro line. private pods with tv services included. 
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"a very fun and interesting place to stay! a bit more attention needs to be paid to cleaning the pods between occupants--spray &amp; wipe walls, railings and shelves, and vacuum around the mattresses. the sheets, blankets and towels were fresh &amp; clean, as is the rest of the place. it can get a bit noisy some nights, but they supply earplugs which takes care of that issue for those people who need to get up early. friendly &amp; helpful staff makes podshare a great place to stay, and i miss being there!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,"great place to wind down at, has all the amenities for techies, and i loved it! only issue for me was the door being open a lot and the staff at the door would step away from time to time leaving it unguarded. it wouldn't bother me normally, but the area was downtown hollywood and not on a great looking street. if youre looking for a great place with all the amenities you would get at a nice hotel then definitely stay here. fun vibe, great friendly staff, and right in thick of hollywood!"
England,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay in central hollywood, not far from capitol records tower. unique vibe with individual pods rather than bunks. larger / more luxurious than standard bunks, with added extras like personal tvs, power, etc. all 10 pods are in one large area, although everyone seems to keep quiet at night so it's actually chilled and peaceful most of the time. could do with more bathrooms as there is only one on the ground floor and one on another floor. clean and staff were great! recommended!"
NewZealand,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great stay with great people! podshare really go out of their way to make you feel welcome!  i thoroughly recommend staying here for the staff &amp; the type of accommodation it's the best there is.... bar none!  5 stars
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,awesome place to stay. staff members are very nice. place is normally clean. wifi is reliable. very friendly fun atmosphere.   
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"love this place! can see how it is not for everyone, the pods are open ended so there is not as much privacy as some people might like. despite this i found them quite intimate, i'd recommend asking for a pod on the second floor as the height gives you a little more privacy. awesome staff, great location if you're after hollywood. cool vibe, cool kitchen, great shared bathroom. i'll be here again #podlove."
Australia,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,not your regular hostel! at first we were shocked at the open style of the pods and the intimate nature of the hostel but this is what makes it so special. as there is only space for 10 people you feel like you are part of an exclusive club. the staff are completely awesome and played a big part in making our trip. the beds were comfy 
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"stayed a couple of nights in la at podshare. amazing, best hostel i have ever seen. get your own pod with power, tv, free wifi etc etc. the small amount of people staying there means you get to know them really well and make some friends to explore the city.    hollywood itself i didnt like, but staying here made it awesome. helpful staff, cool people, safe area 5/5."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"totally thought podshare was a complete scam at first but turned out to be the best 5 days in la. so convenient to majorsights and attractions, but believe me that didn't matter as much as the people you meet at the pod!"
Italy,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"nice people, great hostel.... good location."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i was only there for one night... wish i had of stayed longer. everyone is so friendly. close to everything... had an amazing time apart from the cinnamon challenge. thanks guys!
Australia,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,4,8,"the location of podshare was great.  the staff were great and friendly. the actual pods were nice too.  so there were two main issues that i had with podshare.  the first issue was on my last night there, other podestrians were drinking and partying while i as trying to get to sleep.  podshare needs a quiet time that beings from midnight at minimum.  secondly, one toilet and shower was not enough especially in the morning when everyone need to relieve themselves."
Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is a really interesting and conceptual hostel. nothing i would expect to see regularly in the usa. awesome social vibes and cool community feel. the staff were amazing and make you feel like more than just a guest passing through. you can feel the friendliness in the pod-air. the pod set up is really cool and original as well as confortable and the location can't be beat - smack dab in west hollywood. i gave up a free room in a mansion in the hollywood hills to come back and stay here. go!
NewZealand,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,4,8,had a great experience sleeping in the pods. i diffidently recommend staying here as it is a lot different from regular hostels..an the staff are really friendly and helpful....
SaudiArabia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very good place in a good location, and a very friendly staff."
Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"absolutely loved podshare. definitely reccommend it for anybody who wants to stay right where all the action is happening in hollywood. the staff were beyond friendly, and didn't mind us partying and having a good time. nothing but good things to say about this hostel."
Canada,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my friends and i had an amazing stay at podshare. by far the best hostel any of us have stayed at, being there was a highlight of our trip. the staff quickly became friends and we loved all the travellers we met!"
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,the staff here is so amazing and makes you feel like family immediately! such a good vibe from everyone who worked and stayed there. you don't need to worry about bringing anything except for clothes and a toothbrush! you are given everything you need. if you want to party and have a good time then i definitely recommend podshare !!!
Australia,AllMaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"was an amazing experience at podshare, can't wait to stay here again in the future. your pods have everything needed and the staff make you feel welcome and safe while in the building, also the location is great being so close to hollywood blvd. they offer a podcar transport to airport usually but was able to get a ride to six flags magic mountain for the day, had the best time and would like to thankyou again for that."
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a social experiment with a physical address!  i can't speak highly enough of podshare and the podshare staff; elvina, jen, kyle and mykee. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. i stayed four nights in total at podshare. 3 + 1 night before flying out from lax.  the facilities were great. the podestrians (other guests) were all fabulous. i found that the average podestrian was well educated, left of centre, adventurous and funny. i had no issues with security here and just love this place. ill b bak!"
Norway,Male,31-40,7.4,8,2,10,8,10,6,8,very friendly and supportive staff/owners at a perfect location. the place is a little small and could in my opinion increase security measures. all in all a great place to stay in la.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,fun fun fun i love it worth the money and they have netflix in your pod oh yeah
Austria,Male,25-30,8.3,8,6,10,8,10,8,8,"extraordinary hostel with nice helpful staff. the hostel simple consists out of a sleeping area, lounge, kitchen and bathroom, so don't expect any privacy. there were also more people sleeping in podshare (on air mattresses) than there were pods. but if you'r fine with that (like me) you will like it!"
Mexico,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,8,6,10,6,8,"it was good but there was so many ppl for one bathroom. besides that, the place is very clean n the dorms are really nice."
England,Couple,25-30,7.1,8,6,8,6,6,8,8,"our stay at podshare was a game of two halves.  the night we arrived elvina (the owner) was away and the staff she had left in charge used the opportunity to party in the dorm with some guests, drinking and playing music well into the   early hours. had we only been staying this night i would have written the place off, however the next night elvina returned and everything was great."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i have been staying in hostels for a decade now and i have to say that podshare has the best atmosphere of any hostel that i have ever stayed in.   i immediately felt a sense of community with the other guests and staff.  they have the most friendly and helpful staff that i have ever seen at a hostel.  the location is very nice too, located close to the redline subway and lots of restaurants and other stores.   i highly recommend this hostel!"
England,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the place was absolutly brilliant, only problem was there is no telephone so had to walk to a street phone but overall definate 9/10!! will deffo go back! :-d"
China,Female,18-24,7.7,8,6,10,8,6,8,8,"the location is good. it's just next to hollywood blvd. and close to sunset blvd. there is a good restaurant one block away, called kitchen 24. the facities are also very good. however, what's not so good is that one night, one staff was chatting with friend at midnight and due to the noise i couldn't go to sleep until 3 am."
Taiwan,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the people here are nice and talkativeness. they offer me lots of information about the area ,also the owner brought us to a yogurt ice cream shop which are really tasty! besides, the hostel is not just a hostel but almost like a small house, you just share the space, the kitchen and the bathroom with others. in short, this is the best hostel that i ever seen so far."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"podshare easily best hostel experience ive had to date  didn't take long to feel right at home, elvina is doing some serious things there  ill be back soon"
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,this was the greatest hostel! i had no real desire to go to hollywood but went because this place looked so cool and it definitely exceeded expectations. i wish there were more podshare's in the world.
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i ever stayed in!! elvina is very helpful and chilled! would absolutely recommend it!!!
NewZealand,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a fab stay, one of the best places i have stayed in.  would recommend highly!!!  thanks again"
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel with personal atmosphere!
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great location in w.hollywood, close to hollywood boulevard and runyon canyon just to name a few. close to cool bars/restaurants. it is clean, security is safe. has a college chill vibe with organised parties/social events (there is fair warning from the manager about this, so it isn’t private and quiet all the time). the manager/staff are hospitable and helpful – trust, they know what’s good in la. i asked about a late night spot for ice cream, they advised a real good spot. affordable price!!"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an awesome time there!  i was doing an epic 56 hours of travel to get back to new zealand from colombia, and podshare  was an awesome place to chill in between the madness of flights i had.  the owner is super friendly and helpful, and all the peps staying there were really chilled as well.  just a really mint place to stay!"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"definitely the best place i've stayed in the us, or anywhere for that matter. everything about it is unique, from the networked tvs to the amazing host elvina. podshare's philosophy of getting a 'full experience', not just a bed, is right on the money. it has some real character and charm not found anywhere else. i hung out several times with the other guests, and made some real friends who i'll definitely be staying in touch with. as the former governator would say... i'll be back."
Brazil,Female,31-40,8,6,8,8,8,10,8,8,the owner is very friendly and really enjoy the atmosphere! i loved the concept of podshare and will recommend for everyone!
Canada,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,podshare is a new and great way to hosteling.  couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in la.
Argentina,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really want to recommend the podshare! it was amazing. i had everything i needed, elvina helped me out with everything, and always went the extra mile! i am definately coming back. needless to say the location is perfect, just around the corner from the walk of fame, bus stops and metro station. i couldn't ask for more! natalia."
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,very nice place! i want to return some day.
Singapore,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"podshare is not just a hostel. the amenities are clean and more than what a 'hostel' offers.  it is a home away from home. this is hollywood's hidden secret! great location, value for money and a great way to meet new people. if you missed out on dorm life in college, this is your chance to relive it."
USA,Female,41+,4,2,8,2,2,2,2,10,"facility info lists shuttle and availability of 4 beds ensuite. neither is true, management knows and refuses to correct their ad. i had to spend an extra $45 in transportation - had i known, i would have chosen the other hostel that did have shuttle service. room was clean but, after adding in the extra $45 and having to sleep 1 mom with 3 teenaged boys in 2 beds - no way!"
Germany,Female,25-30,5.1,4,6,6,6,4,4,6,the light went on every hour during the night. i turned it off every time but it went automatically on again!  furthermore you can hear the street and everyone walking around.  
Australia,Male,25-30,4.6,6,4,4,4,6,2,6,the place is quite run down and the area it's in is quite bad. the only plus is that it's close to the airport.
England,Couple,31-40,8,6,10,8,10,6,6,10,"a last minute one night stop off after a long flight. close to the airport, huge room and amazing comfortable bed! quite pricey but was last minute"
USA,Female,41+,6.6,6,10,10,6,2,4,8,"be prepared to pay a $50.00 key deposit.  i was told that was mandatory to stay there.  the next morning, the next clerk said i did not pay the deposit so there was nothing to return.  i showed him my receipt for the deposit and he paid it back.  i was really confused, if it was mandatory for me to pay a $50.00 key deposit, why wouldn't the morning desk person know, that of course i paid it, it was mandatory?  really weird!  bathroom tub and toilet - stained but clean.  "
USA,Female,31-40,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"for the value of the place (and the proximity to lax) the place was a good value.     i had a issue with the check in, charging me $100 extra (and telling me when i check out i will be refunded) i've never had that happen before.    also the hotel room had a weird smell in the room.      pros:  close to lax  free juice and dougnuts in the am    cons: weird billing charges  weird hotel room smell"
Germany,Couple,18-24,6.3,6,6,8,6,8,4,6,"overall okay.   cons: old and outdated rooms with very little charme, noisy (main street, airport nearby and poorly constructed windows); breakfast not worth mentioning   pros: close to lax, free wifi and free parking, food options nearby "
England,Couple,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"we had a large double room. very clean, quiet and good value for money. as we had a very early flight fro lax the owner was very obliging and put the breakfast out early."
Poland,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"we've cancelled the stay and although the payment was to be made upon arival, we were charged nonetheless. we will fill a visa chargback. have fun with them!"
Germany,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"super friendly staff!!! big room, clean, close to airport, good bus connection to santa monica etc."
Australia,Female,18-24,5.4,6,8,4,4,6,2,8,"the wifi didn't work in our room. the hotel is close to the airport which is why we stayed there, it was clean although we could hear arguments in other rooms which made it a bit of a scary place to stay. i'd recommend going elsewhere if you can afford it."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,10,6,10,6,6,8,"not a very interesting area to stay except for being sort of close to the airport (still an hour walk away). my room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was huge! my biggest complaint is that the airport shuttle i asked for at the front desk never showed up."
China,Male,18-24,7.1,8,8,6,8,8,6,6,location is not quite good but it is a nice place to stay if u choose sightseeing in downtown cause the staff can provide useful information.
Netherlands,Male,25-30,4.6,8,4,4,2,4,4,6,"bedrooms are ok and relatively clean. the noise of airplanes which are passing is at an acceptable level. breakfast was very poor, just a table with a coffee machine and a toaster (but no bread). the breakfast room has the size of a small kitchen were no tables are provided. i guess you are supposed to go back to the hotel room after collecting the food. parking lot gave the impression that it functioned as meeting point of the underworld, especially after sunset."
Australia,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,6,10,"bag snatching event (not anyone i know, just witnessed it) whilst getting dinner sorta put a downer on the stay."
England,Male,18-24,6.9,6,10,4,6,8,6,8,this was an ok place to stay     miles away from anywhere buy close to lax
Germany,Male,41+,6.3,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,"rooms were clean and ok. it´s like a motel and not like a hostel, but for a short stay ok. can´t tell anything about breakfast, but theres only breakfast from 7.30 pm to 9 pm and no information about this by check in or somewhere else."
Netherlands,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,"do not expect anything from breakfast, which was only really bad-tasted lemonade, some pre-pack dough and a apple. so very bad for a hotel. furthermore very close to the airport (compared to the rest of la). within 45 - 60 min with public transportation, what only costs $1.50  good place when traveling on low budget to get some rest from the flight."
Brazil,Male,25-30,5.4,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,lots of noise at night.
Germany,Female,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"there was no continental breakfast as promised on the website, only some sweet stuff."
Brazil,Female,18-24,2.6,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,"horrible place, the hostel is in the middle of nowhere, horrible staff who don't help you, there is a hostel in front of this that is awesome. i would never recommend this hostel"
England,Couple,41+,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,we were quite happy with the service and the price. it was handy to the airport which was really all we needed.
Austria,Couple,18-24,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,8,8,"they had everything we needed. hairdryer, wifi and a fridge. the room was very clean and the bathroom was huge. everything worked, nothing was broken or demaged. the breakfast was nice. tea, coffee, pancakes, donugts, bread, orange juice and so on. really nice :)  i would visit it again"
Sweden,Couple,25-30,6.3,6,4,6,8,6,6,8,"good location near the airport. there is a bus right outside that takes you to and from the airport, so you dont need the expensive shuttle.  the location is quite scary som dont go out after dark, and the breakfast is a muffin and coffee. but if youre just looking for a place to stay before you head to the airport, this one is fine."
Germany,Female,41+,4.3,4,6,6,4,2,4,4,"i had to pay more than it said on the email, the woman in the reception was rather unfriendly. the door could not be locked with with an extra lock,most motels have an extra lock inside.it was very loud and the pillows were smelling sweat  .the showerhead was broken.i will never chose that hostel again!/"
France,Male,31-40,5.4,4,6,4,6,6,4,8,"it is a very classic motel, not so close to the airport.  shuttle to airport is expensive and not included.  staff refused to cancel the included breakfast, so we paid for it but didnt enjoy it because our flight was too early in the morning."
Guatemala,Couple,25-30,5.4,4,6,4,6,8,4,6,"the staff was nice, the room was ok although we felt it was a bit expensive. the area didnt seem safe."
USA,Female,31-40,6,8,6,6,6,4,6,6,"the female staffer nice. the man, nice but horrible.  i called 2 weeks before my vaca and shared my flight came in at midnight. i was told there was around the clock check in. i arrived in la and had a major hold up with my rental car. called around 1:45am i was still coming-  the man told me it was too late for me to check in unless i wanted to pay xtra and leave at 7am? i had no where to go.  i sat in a denny's. finally 5am i drove there. a nice woman checkin out gave me her room until morning"
Japan,Female,31-40,4.9,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,"the worst thing is that the room smelled someting strange (old??).the security was not enough for this area, and i felt scary and noisy to open the window.even if i asked the front desk how to get to downtown etc, they did not provide information about the bus transit at all. i will not stay there again."
Canada,Couple,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"we were really happy with the room. a 15 or 20 minute bus ride from the airport (it's on a public bus route), the room had good heat / air conditioning, the water was hot, the bed was comfortable. we would stay here again... highly recommended."
Austria,Couple,25-30,6.3,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,"near airport, not so expensive, everything was ok"
Germany,Male,31-40,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,4,8,its a typical motel for amerika
Malaysia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very satisfied with the room
England,Female,31-40,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,8,10,it will be nice if they let people to chek out little later if they flights are not until late afternoon.
Taiwan,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,it's great.
USA,Female,18-24,5.7,4,6,8,4,6,4,8,"i chose this hotel for its nearness to the airport. having just return from a month in thailand, and having stayed in some pretty basic accommodation, i still felt like this place was worse than anyplace i had stayed abroad. it's the kind of place where you have to check the room for bed bugs. all in all, it did the job. but spend the extra 20 dollars and stay somewhere better."
France,Male,25-30,8.7,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,"cheap and clean hostel near airport lax, ideal if you need to be quickly to airport, but a little far from touristic places in la."
Ireland,Couple,25-30,5.3,0,6,4,0,6,4,6,"if you want to go on budget and you do not pretend too much, this place is ok. quite clean, breakfast poor but ok and secure place. but be aware, the place is far away from the downtown (at least 1.5/2 hours by car) and this means that if you do not have a car or you do not like to drive in crazy freeway go somewhere else."
USA,Female,18-24,3.7,0,6,2,0,8,2,2,i knew this hotel would be bad when i walked in and the concierge sat behind bullet proof glass. this motel is in a sketchy neighborhood. there are no good grocery stores in the immediate vicinity. the room was dirty. it did not have a blow dryer or a coffee maker. the tub had a brown residue on the bottom. i had to shower with flip flops on. i asked for a non-smoking room and got a smoking room. my clothing reeked the next day.
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,0,6,8,0,8,6,10,an extremely nice room for a very good price!!!
Australia,Female,31-40,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,10,"if you just need a place to rest while you wait for a connecting flight or just need to get into the time zone, i thought this place was good.  the bed was comfy, the staff picked us up in the shuttle for $5 per person, then because we were too early for check in time, we left our bags and the guy dropped us off at a nearby shopping centre which i thought was nice.    i would recommend this place if you're on a budget."
Germany,Female,25-30,3,0,6,2,0,2,2,4,"in my affirmation i should pay less than the man told me at the reception. that was a strange beginning. the room was big, but not nice. the window had a hole and it was sooooo noisy. we slept with oropax and we woke up so often. we had a ugly spider at the ceiling.... if you clean the room of your guests, please kill the spiders!!!"
Australia,Female,25-30,5,0,6,4,0,4,4,8,"good place to stay if you are just stopping over, not really a hostel just a cheap motel. was pretty clean and the beds we comfortable but the shower was one of the worst i have ever used. pretty scary area. good value for the money only would reccommend for a stop over."
Germany,Female,18-24,3.7,0,2,4,0,2,6,2,i asked for more towels but the guy said that they don´t have any more. what?? you are a hotel and you don´t have any more towels!? when we came back from dinner we recognized that someone was in our room and took one of the towels which were already in the room. just barefaced and rude!!
Sweden,Male,18-24,5,0,6,2,0,6,2,8,"i only went here for one night. the rooms are big and very comfortable but it is quite expensive for a backpacker and the location is not good, took at least an hour to get to downtown la by bus. good if you land in la late and are travelling early the next morning, the hotel is located very close to the airport!"
Canada,Couple,18-24,2.7,0,2,2,0,2,2,6,"it's a cheap hotel, not a hostel, so if you're backpacking and you want to meet people, this would not be the place for you. also, it's not in a very safe area and there are constant sirens along the street. stay here if you have a car and are just passing through."
USA,Male,18-24,5.3,0,6,10,0,2,2,6,stayed here because it was very close to lax airport. if not probably wouldn't stay here again.
USA,Female,31-40,6.9,8,6,4,8,8,6,8,nice place
Finland,MixedGroup,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,"- helpful owner!   - near metro station, but somewhat far from downtown. however the supermarket (food4less) and cheap fast food places are near the motel.   - really cheap (especially if you travel in a group of four)  - overall clean  - unfortunately no"
Australia,Male,41+,8,10,8,6,8,8,8,8,good staff who were helpful.
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,8,10,6,10,10,10,10,not bad place to stay but location is questionable.  i do recommend staying there overall i was satisfied with my stay.
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8,10,10,4,8,10,6,8,"location is super close to compton and overall not the nicest area to stay in los angeles, but the staff is friendly and accommodating and made sure we had all we needed. 4 people for $70 a night is very cheap. i was comforted by seeing nicer vehicles parked in the parking lot so we were not alone in wanting cheap travel endeavors "
Italy,Female,41+,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"a very convenient place to stay for several days while visiting lis angeles, beaches &amp; orange county. close to freeway &amp; metro station. staff cheerful, accommodating &amp; helpful."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"the staff we very accommodating with a a change of booking, late check in and late check out. would have been really nice to have a kettle but happy with the microwave and fridge."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,6.9,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,"a nice motel, but lynwood didn't feel like the safest place to stay. quite far from the tourist destinations and it would be best to have a car if you stay here as the trains are a bit of a hassle. the staff are friendly and helpful. "
USA,Male,25-30,7.4,6,6,8,8,8,6,10,nice clean room with everything that one needs. quiet even though we expected a loud night with some surprises. close to the metro stop and restaurants. wifi worked great! ceiling window at night during shower was somewhat creepy. felt like someone was watching.
Indonesia,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,8,8,8,the location is near from the metro station and it's just one line (green line) to the airport. it's very easy to travel everywhere from here. restaurants and food are available near the motel too. i love staying here.
Indonesia,Male,25-30,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,closed to train metro by walking around 5 minutes
Indonesia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,8,10,8,8,10,staying in mission motel on my first night in los angeles was a great experience. the room was clean enough and quite spacious. wifi connection was excellent too. it was really worth the money.
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,6,8,10,10,10,"my experience was really good, i have been other hostels-kind in la before, so i wasn't expecting too much. i had the private room and it's pretty nice, the room is very clean, bathroom works perfect, wifi working good (also this wifi works in different parts of la), and i even had a microwave and fridge.  the owner might look serious but he is really kind and helped me a lot."
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.9,10,6,6,10,10,10,10,the owner is great! helped us a lot!
China,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,8,8,8,"great price, evwn there is a digital safe in the room, the room is far better than best value inn(given the good price), andy is very friendly, the bed is great! beautiful surrounding"
Canada,Male,18-24,5.1,6,8,6,2,6,4,4,"wifi should be upgraded, more pillows in beds."
Australia,Female,41+,8.6,10,8,8,8,8,8,10,"it is a nice motel with excellent location, mrt green line from air port direct to motel with in 5 minute walking distance, bed sheets are very clean."
England,Female,18-24,7.7,10,8,4,8,8,8,8,the receptionist was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. the motel was well maintained and we had an enjoyable stay.
England,Couple,25-30,8,10,10,4,10,10,2,10,"had a string of prostitutes using the room next door, didn't get much sleep :("
Mexico,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,6,10,"its a quiet place, but far away from everything, if you drive its not a problem"
Slovakia,Female,18-24,7.7,10,6,6,8,10,6,8,we were three days in a motel. we came late and went after the departure time and staff was accommodating. a big plus is laundry in the area. there are also good internet connection and good location (near metro - green line). the disadvantage was the quarter where live mexicans and we are little different.
CzechRepublic,Couple,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,8,8,"great room, plenty of space, good internet connection. nice staff, guy in the office gave us much better room than we paid for."
Germany,MixedGroup,18-24,4.6,6,6,2,2,6,4,6,the staff went into the room before we did and sprayed room spray so it does not smell so bad. there was a really bad smell coming out of the office. the water pressure was insanely high that it almost hurtles to shower there. no breakfast... it isn't a good location so hey could at least offer breakfast.
CzechRepublic,Couple,25-30,7.4,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,"great value for money, kinda  good location (walking distance to green line - lax connection, bus 60 downtown) on the other hand better have a car than walk those streets (motel itself is an safe spot), motel standard facilities ok, wifi ok, helpful staff!"
Canada,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,4,10,10,6,10,"the hostel itself was very good: the staff was welcoming, nice and helpful. the room was clean and comfortable.  we were disturbed by noisy arrivals in the middle of the night though."
Ireland,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,4,8,8,6,10,staff were very friendly and helpful. maid cleaned every day. had to pay extra for wifi however and the location is a bit dodgy
France,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,6,4,10,6,10,"price : cheap  location : not so well located for pedestrian (20 min walk from silver line, but far from the touristical place). location is ok with a car ok because very close to highway.  people there are very nice and welcoming.   look : the hotel looks oldy and facilities are old.  to be known though : it is allowed to smoke in the bedroom. so if you're a non smoker be prepared to be in a room after a smoker. (not very enjoyable)."
Brazil,Couple,25-30,8,10,6,6,8,10,8,8,"it's a regular motel from united states but they have a swimming pool then i can say that it's can be a difference for your choice. everybody say that it is so far from everything and i agree but thinking better there is no problem to stay so far from the downtown if you rent a car because the traffic in la is terrible and the most popular beachs are far from the downtown. to resume my opinion, if you don't want to pay a lot of money to sleep then chose stay in the sea rock."

England,Male,18-24,5.4,6,4,2,6,8,4,8,if you enjoy staying right between compton and inglewood then this is the place for you. in a pretty rough neighbourhood and close to absolutely nothing of interest. 
Germany,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,4,8,10,6,6,"the sea rock inn is very far away from everything, so you definetly need a car. the wifi costs extra. all in all it is good inn, but if you like to party without driving to the clubs, you should take one of the many inn´s in hollywood."
England,MixedGroup,41+,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,"good place to stay for transport.  lax airport 20 mins and 30 dollars in taxi aprox. didn't explore location much, but seemed a little uninteresting. the only reason i ticked average on review for facilities, was because the internet was not working during my stay."
Japan,Male,41+,4.6,4,4,8,2,6,2,6,"the building was very old and rusty.  windows were thin and almost broken.  not a few of the facilities were broken or missing.  burger restaurant and convenience store were nearby, but the road to them smells terrible.  i can't recommend anybody stay here."
USA,Male,41+,7.7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,the place was nice micro-atmosphere within the metro l.a. area.
Germany,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the man on the counter was very friendly. the money was worth it.
Lithuania,Couple,18-24,8.3,10,6,6,10,8,8,10,"room was spacious, we had fridge and microwave. wifi isn't free, also maid took my towel (don't take white towels to hotels). everything was very well (except towel)."
England,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very nice staff, very very helpful to me they were"
England,Male,25-30,2.9,2,6,2,2,4,2,2,our stay here vas very bad: the carpet in the room was filthy - leave the shower with clean feet and they'll be black with dirt in 1 minute flat. the pool doesn't have a filtration system so expect a skin on top of dead insects and plant matter. the pool also gave me a rash on my nuts which is still present. the location is central but la is so big that everything of interest is about 8 miles away in different directions. the room wreaked of smoke. a very poor hotel indeed.
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,"everything was fine and we enyojed our stay. the room was huge but the bathroomdoor didn't close which was sometimes a little bit annoying.   the facility list on hostelworld.com says ""free wifi"", but wifi is not included."
Switzerland,Couple,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,10,8,8,really friendly stuff that likes to help you find your locations and get started with this huge city.
Singapore,Female,31-40,6,0,2,8,0,8,4,8,"on our 1st night here, we witnessed true hollywood stunt just in front of our hostel with police pointing guns at a suspicious vehicle. security in this area is not very good. unless you drive &amp;/or have a tight budget, this can be a good stop point to disneyland &amp; san diego... else you wanna consider other hostel. staff were really helpful but the bullet-proof window at the counter proves this area is complicated. its a place where prostitutes will come at night. else this place is perfect."
NewZealand,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,it was a very good and clean budget hostel that is good for non-partiers as it has a quiet after 10pm rule. clean room and the fan cooled down the room pretty well even though there was no a/c. the staff were so friendly and helpful thanks so much and it was great that there were laundry facilities available.    my only &amp;#39;complaint&amp;#39; would be that there are two showers in the bathroom and everyone has access so they&amp;#39;re not private and you have to change in the shower cubicle. no biggie though!
USA,Female,18-24,6.9,6,4,6,6,10,6,10,"i appreciated that the women's bathroom required a key to open, but the lock was nearly impossible: front desk staff had to demonstrate the trick to getting it to open which involved a lot of feeling for a click and then pushing in a certain amount and other such finagling--i never really got the hang of it and there were times i just gave up. lack of ac was difficult to deal with --the days were 90+ degrees and the street noise at night was so loud i had to keep the windows closed."
Canada,Female,25-30,8.9,6,10,8,8,10,10,10,"the staff was super friendly, the hotel was clean at all times, even the common bathrooms. the sheets smelled great (it did enhance my bedtime experience), but the mattress was squeeky a bit and curving in the middle (my bedtime experience lost a few points there).    i thought it was at a walking distance from the beach, but ""two miles away from the beach"" was actually a one-hour walk? so i took the 8 bus for a dollar back and forth, which wasnt too bad. wifi connection was good."
England,Female,25-30,8.9,10,6,8,8,10,10,10,loved the location as it was neighbourhood-y. santa monica beach 
Sweden,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"i came late, so there was no staff there on my arrival, but they sent me a long and informative email prior to my arrival, so i know how to get in, and how to find the key to my room. nice staff, nice surroundings."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,8,10,"i had a really pleasant stay here. room was quiet and clean and the bed was comfortable. staff were friendly. the location is a little out of the way but it's a peaceful area and felt safe. i found it to be a nice walk down to santa monica pier and venice beach, though it may be a little far for some."
England,Female,18-24,8,8,8,6,8,10,8,8,"loud cleaning staff very early in the morning, very thin walls i could hear people walking around and talking upstairs at night.   liked the fridge and microwave in room  friendly, welcoming and helpful staff"
England,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,8,10,8,10,"good place to stay, clean rooms and helpful staff. 2 toilets and 2 showers on each floor. nice cafe round the corner and bus stop around corner which takes you to the beach. trader joe's 2 blocks away. safe area "
Finland,Male,25-30,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,the staff were incredibly nice. i was over two hours late for my checkout and didn't get billed any extra. admirable flexibility.
Russia,Male,31-40,7.7,6,8,6,8,10,8,8,"i have only one night in this place. but it was normally, friendly staff, fresh simple room, fresh bathroom"
Australia,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the customer service from lenny at reception was exemplary.  he made every effort possible to ensure my stay at oceanpark hotel was safe and comfortable. he had a great knowledge of the sights to see in los angele and of other states in u.s.a. congratulations to lenny, matt and all the staff at ocean park hotel. i will certainly return and recommend the hotel to everyone, who plans to visit santa monica."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"staff very kind and accommodating. showers clean, very hot and refreshing after a long day of hiking. if you know your way around santa monica (los angeles) location is great, bus system conveniently in front of hotel. price you can not beat for la private room at this price is unheard of! highly recommend and will stay again when i return to la. this hotel is simple and offers what a traveler needs, private room, queen bed, clean, safe and quiet."
Portugal,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,8,4,6,6,6,the location is pretty bad for a hostel...
Norway,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,8,8,8,10,10,"after staying at the radisson hotel for a couple of nights for a conference, i have to say that my stay at the ocean park hotel was far more enjoyable!  the place has a really great atmosphere - very bright, very clean, very comfortable.  i only stayed at a night but really enjoyed it.  it is a little far from the beach though - about an hour's walk (there might have been a shortcut?).  in any case, if i visit la again this would be where i'd stay! great value for money."
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,the staff were very friendly and accommodating.
Scotland,Female,31-40,7,0,6,8,0,8,6,8,"had a good stay here. good location, clean, warm, had everything i needed....except a decent shower! they were awful! no water pressure to speak of and they did that universal bad shower thing of alternating between molten lava hot and liquid nitrogen cold! took forever to get showered as i was jumping in and out the water for the few seconds it was tolerable to do so after waiting for the temperature to come up/go down. seems like a small thing but you've got to have a decent shower."
Australia,Male,25-30,9.3,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,staff were extremely helpful and great location
Australia,Male,41+,7.3,0,6,6,0,10,8,8,"nothing spectacular, but value for money. place to put your head, bus stop outside, nice little area and was easy to make ur way into town.nice  cafe next door for breakfast.  what more can you want?"
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8,0,10,6,0,10,6,8,"the accomodation was excatly what we needed, with basin in room, bathrooms were a bit small, but overall was a good start to our oe"
Egypt,Male,31-40,2.6,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,"actually i didn't get any room, they told me that there is no room available, and they did not have any reservation for me, i'm not sure if that's hostelworld mistake or the motel mistake"
Australia,Male,25-30,6,8,4,8,6,8,4,4,place is pretty hectic. cheapest room you can find in los angeles so you get what you pay for. pretty sketchy neighbourhood but i didnt have any problems. close to downtown and to a subway station. be careful.
Colombia,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the worst place i have ever been to in my life, people try to break in your room? beggars, prostitutes, smells and very badly kept. if go to la never check in to this hotel"
