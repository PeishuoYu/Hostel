USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,10,6,10,10,10,one of the loveliest hostels i&#039;ve stayed at. clean. very nice staff. pancakes in the morning. it&#039;s about 2.5 miles from union station which is a stop off the train directly from denver airport. i chose to walk but there&#039;s a bus line with lots of runs from union station to the block by the hostel. hostel was kept comfortably warm. the best part of the experience was how nice all the travelers were. everyone got along great. wonderful experience.

USA,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,10,6,"this place was great. the first night i got there the restroom smelled a bit, but they definitely clean. i enjoyed the hospitality, and the free breakfast was great. got breakfast once it, but it’s nice they offer it. colfax is a little sketch, but despite going alone i never had any problems. my biggest fear was my items getting stolen, but i think people staying are very kind full of others. i would recommend staying, pepsi stadium is nearby and it’s a great place to visit. price was great!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,i have a hard time sleeping in rooms with people so i should have gotten a private room. but it was good otherwise. little warm but better than being cold!
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,4,6,8,4,8,6,4,"the staff was friendly but i found this hostel to be pretty dirty. the location was decent, with a few good neighborhood options for food and such, but i wouldn&#039;t stay again. the room rate was pretty pricey for a dirty, loud (people in the hallway were talking till 12am-1am which made paying for a private room feel pointless), and smelly house."
USA,Male,25-30,8.3,8,10,6,8,10,8,8,"i had a great time staying at this hostel. the location is in a shady area, however i never had any problems."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i am new to the hosteling but ej and his staff made me feel incredibly welcome and i thoroughly enjoyed my stay with them and the other guests. both the staff and fellow travelers were great to talk to and get recommendations from! the hostel is kept incredibly clean and the facilities have a slightly luxurious old school meets modern cool feel. plus who doesn&#039;t want to wake up to the smell of freshly made pancakes! the hostel located close to thump coffee and the famous molly brown house!
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"staying at the mile high guest house was an amazing experience!  staff and volunteers were friendly, accommodations cozy, and i met amazing people from all over the world!  the location is perfect - a little over a mile from downtown and right on top of lots of restaurants, bars, and music venues.  always something to do here!  i highly recommend mile high for an amazing hostel experience! "

USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"super charming place with beautiful rooms, a great common space, and a nice, big kitchen. this house-gone-hostel really creates a cool, casual family vibe with everyone staying there and the amazing staff too. location is a little shady honestly, it’s not the best part of denver. that said, there’s a bus stop right outside and the bus system makes it really easy to get around. also, no lockers, but they said they’re on the way.  all in all, pleasant stay, would definitely return!

USA,Male,25-30,7.4,6,10,8,6,10,8,4,"amazingly friendly staff. common areas have a very nice and chill vibe. my bed had a few minor stains. the underlying foam mattress was very comfortable but was stained as well. there was no mattress protector or mattress pad. third-floor shower had visible gunky stuff around water jets near feet (it was a jacuzzi tub that hadn&#039;t been well cleaned). second-floor bathroom looked immaculately clean, though."
Pakistan,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing people. nice clean and quit area. better for those who want to explore the denver popular areas. ideal location for local transportation. i recommend to all. my stay was very pleaunt.

USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i had a late check in and instructions were clear and sent to my email and over the phone. you put the sheets on the bed yourself, which can be difficult to do in the dark at midnight so i wish they would&#039;ve done that for me. otherwise, everything was great. pancakes were good. no butter though. located a short walk from the 15 bus and pretty convenient. you can walk to the botanical gardens, city park, and the museum of nature and science. overall good, fun looking hostel with great value!"

"
Mexico,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great play to stay for a laid back atmosphere and if you are just planning to venture off into the city. i especially liked the fact that they were 420 friendly.  the staff was great always willing to help and even make you pancakes in the mornings. you meet all sorts young people and even go out with the strangers you just met.   i recommend this place to anyone with the right attitude for a house named the mile high house.

"
England,Male,41+,8.3,6,8,8,8,10,8,10,nice house and i found the young staff very friendly .  i had a private room  that was very basic and i feel over priced.  maybe the dorms are better value but as i was over 30 years old i wasn&#039;t allowed to book one.

USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a good time and the staff were very cool and helpful people 
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"i cannot say enough good things about mile high house. the staff were professional and beyond friendly and accommodating, the house itself is gorgeous, and the facilities are very nice. it is also by far the most beautiful hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed in. when seeing it online i changed my plans to stay longer in denver because they had a two night minimum and it was definitely worth it. i had an amazing experience at high house, would whole-heartedly recommend.  "
USA,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,"nice little place, a bit creepy at times but overall nice facilities and staff. the location wasn&#039;t the best, there were some sketchy people hanging around nearby at times. and parking can be a little difficult to find. "
Hungary,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really beautiful house in a nice neighborhood with 2-3 story houses and a lot of greenery, but also several diners and bars also close on colfax ave. staff was super nice and friendly as well."

"
USA,Male,41+,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"beautiful house in a lovely area. staff, led by sara, are great people. i really enjoyed the group outings that were offered--these took advantage of local events like an art walk and peoples&#039; fair. highly recommended--i plan to return."
Canada,Male,18-24,6.9,6,4,6,8,8,6,10,"overall mile high house was a good place to stay, but i think it may be slightly overrated. the beds were uncomfortable and wobbly, there is no place to lock your belongings, and the &quot;breakfast&quot; was just pancake mix pancakes. not sure if it was really worth the price. i did appreciate the cleanliness of the house and the staff who were friendly. "
Netherlands,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,great place: very friendly staff and good atmosphere. the pancakes in the morning are delicious :-)

"
Philippines,Male,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,"love staying at mile high house. the location is great being only a 30 minute walk away from capitol hill and a less-than-$10 ride with uber or lyft to most of the places you&#039;ll want to visit/eat. the staff were also very friendly and helpful, notably sara who was such a gracious host. everyone at the hostel were also very amicable. my only complaint is that the beds were very noisy (made from metal that squeaked every time you moved) with the mattresses not being firm at all. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this was one of the best hostels that i&#039;ve ever stayed in. the staff was friendly, the place was beautiful and located near bars, coffee shops, and a fantastic book store. the only caveat was the 10pm+ enforced quiet hours on the weekends."
USA,Couple,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful stay. sara and her staff were so welcoming and knowledgeable. we felt really comfortable.the house is gorgeous. there are pancakes, a fancy toilet and relaxing porch. "

USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome hostel located just the right distance out of downtown denver. the staff was extremely friendly and did their best to make every guest feel at home. the hostel itself was also quite a beautiful little building.
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,4,10,8,8,8,4,10,"if you&#039;re looking for more of an inn type environment, mile high house is the place for you. while they do have the occasional social event, the atmosphere at the guest house (legally they are not a hostel) is more of one where the guests keep to themselves. if you&#039;re looking for a hostel that creates a social environment for backpackers, i would suggest looking elsewhere. "
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is an amazing hostel. great value, great people, good location. "
Australia,Male,25-30,6,6,4,4,6,6,8,8,"about my 200th hostel  cozy and quaint, a bit far from everything.  nice atmosphere depending on the people.  no lockers though!!  need to get some lockers. it&#039;s all well and good to say we all trust each other, until an opportunist comes along.    could also use some more activities i.e. pub crawls and stuff.    if you are in denver for only a couple of days, stay downtown. if longer, spend a couple of days here as well"
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"it was a great stay overall, loved the pancakes in the morning!"
China,Female,25-30,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"it&#039;s alright comparing to all other hostels oversea, the location is alright with this price."
PuertoRico,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the house is amazing &amp; from the 1800&#039;s. theres a super cool toilet on the first floor and its cannibis friendly.  the pancakes are delicious and the hosts are super sweet ans welcoming. sarah, jen and the two giys are the bomb, definitely coming back! love you mile high!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,6,10,10,6,10,"the staff are fab and the hostel is seriously clean. cons: 1. location - this will depend on preference. for me it was too far from downtown (lodo). it is about a 35-40 minute walk to the heart of however, the uber downtown only cost me 6-9 dollars each time. 2. atmosphere - they close the dinning room and living room at 10pm. many wanted to chill &amp; smoke so they did not care (i wanted to go out too so it mattered to me). "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,this was my first visit to denver and the staff here made me so welcome! on the first night i arrived i quickly made friends and explored the city with others. 
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,6,10,10,10,"the staff are very friendly and have low pressure but inclusive activities for guests. it&#039;s reasonably close to downtown and right next to colfax with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. everything was very clean. the only problem is noise. the lock to the dorm makes a lot of electronic noise when it opens and closes, and the beds are light metal frame bunkbeds which shake and creak a lot if either person shifts at all in them. more solid beds and simple key locks would be a big improvement."
England,Male,18-24,7.7,6,8,6,8,10,8,8,"the hostel is a little far out from the downtown area, accessible by a ~20 min bus. it&#039;s a pleasant building, with modern furnishings, and the staff are very friendly and accommodating.     the main downside is the myriad sources of noise: creaky floorboards and doors, loud locks, and erratic ventilation systems. may not be the best for light sleepers. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was the first american hostel i&#039;d ever stayed in. and by far the most fun i&#039;ve ever had in a hostel. getting to and from the airport on public transport could not be easier. everything you need is on colfax. denver is at your door stop. this is a prime hostel location. there were no lockers but i never once felt the need for one. try the japanese toilet! or else your mile high experience will be cut short. really good vibe and atmosphere. pretty chill. all different people! great!!!
Canada,Female,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"no lockers in the rooms but otherwise i felt my stuff was safe enough. the staff is great, very friendly, and arranged a fun bar crawl while i was there."
Brazil,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,6,10,10,10,10,"nice hostel functioning on a old, spacious, beautiful house. you will have to walk about 45min to downtown, but it is definitely a good place to stay in denver. "
Germany,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed at. beautiful house with spacious rooms, friendly staff and a cozy common area!"
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"very friendly staff, clean facilities and good location. downtown is a short uber/bus ride away (it is walkable, if you&#039;re ambitious) but there&#039;s plenty of restaurants and bars nearby to keep you busy. make sure to check out voodoo doughnuts if you&#039;re looking for some late night munchies. fellow hostel guests were sociable and down to share a joint (it&#039;s a hostel in colorado, so be ready for some weed)."
India,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing location, chill staff. keep in mind that street parking is free (not included in the property description), but it may be a bit hard to find in the evenings/over the weekend. will stay here the next time i&#039;m in denver"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great accommodations, great service. the house was beautiful and the location was perfect. would recommend it to anyone traveling to denver. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place in the heart of denver. minutes away from union station, pepsi center, coors field, dispensaries, etc. very friendly staff, always helpful. the free breakfast is really nice. the house has a very old style classic design. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,i love their japanese toilet. sarah and the crew were all kind and accommodating. 
USA,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,the bunk beds were wobbly
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,8,6,10,6,6,8,6,i was there soon after they opened up.  great location and amazing house. however they need new bathrooms (not enough) and they didn&#039;t have any working lockers to even keep stuff behind the desk (locksmith was supposed to come but didnt) so i didn&#039;t have anywhere to put a laptop securely. also the bunks were like the cheapest aluminum frames they could find and so unsteady that you could practically feel your bunk mate breathe.    i hope for their sake they can make some additional investments
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing, staff were so friendly and the house is incredible!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"mile high hostel is an amazing place to stay and is run my a wonderful manager, who will go out of her way to make your stay a good one. add this to the face that you are in colorado, and you won&#039;t be sorry that you stayed here - guaranteed. :)"
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"first of all, the staff is very kind and welcoming. actually, i was late due to my airplane delayed. however, even though there is check-in time, the staff would let me know how to enter and use the facilities when i got there around 2am by e-mail. they were so nice. and secondly, the atmosphere was also pretty good. finally, the size of room was pretty bigger than most other hostels. it was so nice experience to stay at this hostel for 2 days. "
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"ive stayed in many hostels around america and i have to say, mile high house, in my opinion is the best yet. wonderful staff that lead pub crawls and intimate smoke sessions every night. "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i love love love the mile high house! fantastic location, close to tons of groovy places in denver. the staff was amazing, the house was beautiful and i met tons of wonderful people. if you come, don&#039;t forget to use the japanese toilet downstairs. will be staying here again in the future, no doubt!"
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,hands down one of the best hostels i&#039;ve stayed at. it feels like a home away from home with some of the friendliest staff you&#039;ll meet. as soon as you walk through the door you&#039;ll feel like your part of some big family. only downside to staying here is having to leave.
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the mile high house is one place i&#039;ll never forget! my friend and i were astonished with each and every elegant detail of this historical home. sarah made us feel right at home! she kept us busy with sharing fun places to visit as well as planned evening outings to art shows and pub crawls :d we enjoyed this place so much and will miss it until we return again! -reilly &amp; mady 
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"i arrived early, yet not needing to check in immediately, bivvi did their best to accommodate my earliness. this i appreciated. on top of that, this was my first time staying at a &quot;hostel&quot; in the us, and i was blown away by the hospitality. i am a typical solo female backpacker, thus, usually traveling out of country and expected the us hostel to be sub par. this was not the case and i felt my ski getaway to breckinridge was exactly what i seeked out.. something out of the norm, but beautiful! "
Argentina,AllMaleGroup,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,4,8,10,10,"very cold at night.  pancakes were horribles.  good price, good location."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had such a great time here. first time to denver and such a wonderful way to meet it. the staff is super friendly and helpful. we did group tour activities like seeing the candy factory and then did a pub crawl the next night. it&#039;s a good location and not too far from downtown (8 min drive, 30 min walk). the place is weed friendly but also respectful to those that aren&#039;t interested in it. it felt like a family the way people were and house setup. i was sad to leave, stayed 9 days and loved it."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very clean in a great central location. we loved the house. staff were super down to earth and helpful. pancake breakfast was delicious. overall great atmosphere, great experience!"
USA,Couple,31-40,9.1,10,10,6,10,10,8,10,really nice and fun. very clean. ok neighborhood. 
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"mile high house is everything i wanted in a hostel experience. it&#039;s located within walking distance of many bars, and food, as well as walgreens, and a long walk or short drive/bus from all the attractions downtown-location is ideal. the house is beautiful, clean and cozy, with a great kitchen &amp; dining room. staff were present, friendly and helpful and facilitated lots of activities for guests to do together.    only issues: one cold shower. the dorm needs more outlets/extension cords to each bed."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"really enjoyed our stay at the mile high hostel. highlights include getting drinks with some friendly guests/staff, the piping hot shower, and trying out the $3,000 japanese toilet. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"best hostel i&#039;ve stayed at in the us! staff are amazing, the building is beautiful, really can&#039;t fault it"
England,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel ever!! everyone was so helpful and the place is incredible. my room felt like a hotel room in a mansion and not a hostel. family dinner in the dining hall was really wonderful as well. i would recommend this place over and over again.
Australia,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"words cannot describe how beautiful this building is. it is literally one of the prettiest buildings i have walked in. on top of that, the staff is so much fun and helpful. everything was clean and new and the location was very easy to get to. we went and saw the lights in cheesman park just a few blocks away which i would highly recommend. easily the top location i have ever stayed in. "
Canada,Male,41+,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very good hostel, really funky design and super location close to stadiums, bars and restaurants. also short walk to the train and bus stations. had everything you typically need in a hostel and service is very good. more expensive though than most places i go."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"beware that there is not just a bar in the hostel, but there is also bar below this hostel. the bar may produce a lot of noise.     that being said this hostel was awesome and was the nicest of any of the hostels that i have stayed in. the staff was very helpful and allowed me to store my stuff in the back before i could check in, while i was away at my convention.     the facilities are just as pictured and are even more as amazing when seen in person.     "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,hostel fish was a very clean and well located place to stay.  staff were helpful but could have been more upbeat.
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"had a quick overnight in denver and this hostel was an easy walk from the train, it&#039;s directly over a nice bar/club - which incidentally has some stellar food - if a little pricey. i was in a 6 bed all female dorm but on a dreary tuesday in january had the room to myself. the hostel has its own chill little bar; you get a free drink with your stay so i went and chatted to the bartender/front desk guy who was super cool and laid back.  overall great hostel, i&#039;d go back"
Malaysia,Male,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,the hostel bar is the cheapest place to drink downtown and attracts a good local crowd. the people i met during my stay here was one of the best groups i’ve ever had in a hostel. staff was stressed but were very quick to help with anything you need. the location: you are literally of the heart of the downtown bars/restaurants/breweries.   only downside is that the traffic generated from the bar (noise) and you are also sharing the bathrooms with them so it might be a bit messy in the am
India,Male,25-30,5.1,2,10,10,2,4,6,2,the price is way too high for the facilities provided. no breakfast. staff were mediocre.    pros:  bed was comfy. good locker capacity    cons:  high price  no breakfast  toilets were not cleaned regularly
Brazil,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,8,8,10,10,"beautiful hostel, well located in downtown denver-my friend and i walked around, clean and organized. the only negative point was don&#039;t have outlets near my bunk so i had to leave the phone charging in a chair near the window. very secure though. the bathroom is awesome, clean and you can shower with privacy! i loved my stay there!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,great staff and vibe!!! facilities on point as well. location is the tits!!! looking forward to my return.
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,there was not information given about a elevator on site.  throughout my stay people frequently came upstairs to the hostel looking for a felix who apparently owned a restaurant downstairs.  the people seemed harmless and were apparently legit but i was concerned that this occurred all night long. 
Scotland,Male,31-40,7.4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,"if you&#039;re in town to explore denver and want to have fun, hostel fish is a great place to stay. the staff are pretty friendly and make an effort to create a party atmosphere in a hostel that is boutique and unique. however, if you&#039;re in town for work, as i was, it&#039;s best avoided (particularly thurs-sun) because the hostel is above a very noisy nightclub and also operates as a bar itself, meaning you&#039;re in your pjs brushing your teeth while people are coming in to use the same communal toilets. "
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,10,6,6,10,"not my favorite hostel, but definitely not the worst. location was great if you wanted to be close to bars, but i got there on a saturday night and it was extremely loud. if that&#039;s not a problem for you, then it&#039;s great. it was much quieter during the week. the beds are surprisingly comfy for a hostel, and it was very clean. there is no designated parking, so if you have a car you can rent a parking pass from them for $10 a day. but the lot is two blocks away, so you have to park and walk. "
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,10,10,10,8,very nice hostel! 
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,10,10,8,6,"denver doesn&#039;t have a lot of cheap places to stay, but this was my favorite i&#039;ve tried so far. i recommend a smaller room if possible - the first room i stayed in was rather loud, but i was able to switch to a smaller room that was quiet and much nicer. good amenities offered, including bag check and fast wifi."
SouthAfrica,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"best hostel i&#039;ve stayed at in the usa! great bar and kitchen area, rooms and beds are spacious, and bathrooms were fairly clean. the lockers were a bit small for my bag, but i was only there for 1 night and i didn&#039;t feel that things would get stolen. walking distance to all the great sights and fun bars. would definitely stay here again!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"gorgeous hostel in an amazing location (can walk to anything and everything including a ton of bars and restaurants and union station!), and those beds!! mattresses are freaking thick. staff was great. bar area is gorg and fun for meeting people. seriously - interior decorating is top notch. would stay here again in a heart beat! "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,8,10,10,"hostel fish is really eclectic and fun. my only complaint is that the noise from the bar downstairs was so loud, i couldn&#039;t sleep. it was open until 2am, so if you have an early flight or are a light sleeper (both were true for me), i would suggest looking somewhere else."
USA,Female,41+,5.1,6,6,8,4,8,2,2,"they have a bar set up with the public welcome and the bunks are directly above this bar, so there was loud music and loud people drinking until 2 am. i&#039;m sure this is not great for security either as the bar patrons have access to the bathrooms our floor was using.    also, the bathrooms were disgusting."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,10,8,"great location downtown near all things. can be a bit loud due to being in close proximity to bars. suggest bringing ear plugs and face mask - which i always take with me on a trip. beautiful interior, great vibe."
USA,Male,25-30,6.9,4,10,8,6,6,6,8,"upscale hostel!? i was skeptical, but willing to pay the 75.00 for a bed in a dorm. big mistake. i got stuck on the 3rd bunk up. i didn’t even know this was a thing. i’m amazed the insurers allow this. it’s so high up i went to toss my towel up onto the rail, and it fell 3’ short.    the metal ladder is so narrow, and smooth it’s a nightmare to climb up, then the cross bars of the beds impede two of the ladder rungs. no drink and climb  the bar is cool, kitchen sucks, coffee awful, no breekky."
England,Male,31-40,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,10,the hostel is nice with comfy beds and clean bathrooms. the staff could have been a little friendlier; they often seemed disinterested or distracted.
USA,Female,41+,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,8,10,"nice place.  unfortunately,, the night i was there, there was a block party on the street next to the hostel.  very loud.  it ended around 3:00 a.m.  i don&#039;t know if it is a common thing, but it did affect my experience at the hostel."
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"great hostel! very friendly people and the common area at the bar is a great way to meet other travelers.  these bunkbeds were the most secure bunks i&#039;ve ever slept in in a hostel - no shaking or squeaking or waking me up when other people climbed up the ladder (the top bunk is terrifyingly high). it&#039;s a lovely, clean hostel, the one thing that stopped it from being perfect was that not every bed was set up with a plug outlet but the front desk people were super nice to switch me to one that did"
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"this place is awesome. someone was always near the front desk. security in the evenings. 16th street, and tons of bars and restaurants are a short walk away. all of the staff were super chill, and very accommodating. the community room was great; it really promoted getting to know the other people staying there. the bar was a plus! everything was very clean. surprisinly comfortable beds. although the price is a little higher than what&#039;s in the area, the value is unmatched. definitely recommend!"
Colombia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"i had a blast at this hostel. it has a great location, the beds are comfy, and the atmosphere is awesome. definitely recommend staying here. i was in a mixed room with 9 beds, it was mostly guys and one other girl besides me, but it was really fun."
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"great place to stay, location is awesome right in next to a lot off bars and restaurant. walking distance to coors stadium. overall great place to stay. only complain is that bathrooms did get a bit dirty in the early morning from the night before. definitely recommend staying. "
Finland,Female,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,10,8,10,6,"it is definitely a party hostel!people were super friendly,but it was pretty hard to get a good night sleep with all the drunk people and loud music.the bathrooms could use a cleaning more often!but i had fun visiting denver overall."
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,6,4,8,6,6,the bathrooms are very clean but the rooms look awful (painting peeling). i slept on the third bed and it was awful as well. there is barely any space between the ceiling and the bed and coming down is very dangerous! so dangerous that it should be illegal! the staff was helpful but not supper friendly.  lots of homeless people in the vicinity but right in downtown.  
Canada,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"denvers hostel fish well sitatued and a great space - renovated brothel with wonderful high ceilings, interesting common rooms and decor for reading or hanging out.  bright modern bathrooms.  courteous and helpful staff. bar and kitchen have natural light - friendly space allows travellers to share stories over morning coffee or a more lively bar atmosphere in the evening.  close to main light rail station.  my dorm mates were easy to get along with.   reccomend if you&#039;re on a budget."
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,2,10,10,10,"as far as hostels go, this is a very very nice hostel. renovated facility, bunks are clean and well thought out (room beyond the mattress for your belongings). bar is awesome, place is nicely decorated, location is perfect. one huge huge issue though: it is located directly above ophelia&#039;s, a pretty hoppin bar with live music. the entire building is constructed from an old wooden ship and you hear every.damn.noise. it is laughably loud, i got zero sleep (w/earbuds). seriously, be warned."
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,10,8,"it was an awesome stay, met some great friends and had a great experience overall! one night was rough just because of some of the people i stayed with who didn&#039;t respect the rules and kept me up pretty much all night. but it is a shared room with like four+ other people after all (just gotta hope for the best to be stuck in a room with somewhat respectful bunch). super clean bathroom considering the fact that its shared by a lot of people! loved the atmosphere and the activities they hosted! "
Australia,Male,31-40,9.1,10,6,8,10,10,10,10,"this has definitely been one of my favourite hostels to stay at across the us. the facilities here are fantastic, especially the beds which are spacious and comfortable. they even use 2-ply toilet paper which is the first time i have ever seen that in a hostel. unfortunately there are no suitcase lockers in the rooms but there is adequate room to store your suitcase and lock it. otherwise it is perfect, just a 15 minute walk from union station and has a bar attached and about 20 bars within 200m"
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had an awesome time here. met several amazing people, killed it at the pub crawl (must-do!) and generally loved the location! it does get to be a fun madhouse right outside the hostel on weekend evenings/nights, so be ready to party!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"really cool staff. located within walking distance of really cool restaurants, bars, and coors stadium. the security lockers are large and you can fit all your belongings inside. my male friend and i stayed in the mixed door and were very comfortable. definitely recommend 🤘"
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"yo, it&#039;s taken me a little bit to get on here to right a review. but just wanted to let you guys know i had a great stay september 7-11. i was fortunate enough to be a returning guest cause i love hostel fish!!! the atmosphere is awesome &amp; the staff is even better. izzy. my dude. it was great meeting you. along with the other staff members i met along the way. much love from tn. see you all next year!!  -kevin "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"an amazing hostel, i wish the owners would open up another in the u.s. beautifully designed rooms, ultra comfy beds, and the hostel bar really encourages you to talk to locals and other guests. i&#039;ll be staying here for my next trip to denver for sure."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"this was my first ever time staying in a hostel and at first i was a little worried. however the staff were amazing, the fellow guests were great and the location was second to none. this is the perfect place to stay in denver especially at the price range and i will absolutely go back when i am in denver next."
England,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,10,8,"pretty expensive fora hostel but the facilities are good, staff are friendly/helpful and a great atmosphere."
England,Male,25-30,8.6,6,8,10,10,10,6,10,great location and very busy at weekends! if it was a little bit cheaper i would have defo stayed longer! close to everything in lodo and amazing staff! 
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"by far the nicest hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed in. hostel fish is in a great location and was easy to walk to from union station. there is a bar on the first floor that can get loud, but luckily they offer ear plugs for free. the beds are comfy, bathrooms clean, chill patio and a helpful staff. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,10,10,6,10,8,"this was a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend! each room has a different theme, all very artsy. there is ac in the units, the showers are nice, the bar is fun, and the kitchen is great, and there is free wifi. everyone i met staying at the hostel was extremely outgoing, and i loved the atmosphere. i am planning on returning!

Israel,Male,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"nice hostel, good staff good location"
Australia,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,10,8,a good place to stay.
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,great location in the heart of the city but keep in mind it&#039;s around 25 miles from the airport. it wasn&#039;t as social as i wanted and they couldn&#039;t do a pub crawl when i was there. the city was also a ghost town by 2 am so it kinda sucks if you&#039;re into late night partying. if you want to avoid the noise from the bar/restaurant downstairs then i suggest booking a room on the top floor. but overall i had a great time and i would stay there again.
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i had a great time here. actually my first hostel ever and i was worried about what&#039;d it be like because i&#039;m usually a fancier person when it comes to vacations.. ie hotels not hostels, but this one was great. it&#039;s in the heart of denver do you really get the feel, food, people to talk to, a dispensary is literally it&#039;s neighbor, and when i say it&#039;s 2-5 mins from one of denvers popular bar area i&#039;m not kidding. there&#039;s a bar called the view.. very dope.  "
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,10,4,10,10,10,"hostel fish is a great hostel. location is fabulous right by many restaurants/bars and coors field. hostel is very clean, including bathrooms. the reason why i&#039;m scoring the facilities low is that i had difficulty sleeping on my top bunk with 8 other people in the room because it got so hot and stuffy in there by morning. the room had air conditioning, but was unable to keep it cool enough for me on the top. after talking with others in the room, they seemed to agree."
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"excellent hostel, i stayed for 4 nights and they were very accomodating. the facilities are great the location boasts an in house bar as well as a fancy bar/restaurant below and a cannabis store next door.    you&#039;d be hard-pressed to find friendlier staff, shout out to isodor! (may have spelled that wrong) "
Germany,Male,25-30,6,2,8,8,4,8,6,6,"expensive, very small kitchen, uncomfortable beds (very soft), very loud at night due to two bars below and bad isolation, good location and nice interior "
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"genuinely one of the best and most thought out hostels i&#039;ve been too, the facilities are amazing with a bar for drinking and a balcony for smoking weed (not sure how many other hostels have this, dispensary is literally next door and you get a discount by showing your hostel key. yes it is a bit more expensive than the other hostels you are used to but it is 100% worth the extra money, booked 3 nights and ended up staying for 7!"
Italy,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,one of the best hostel ever! f.
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,the staff here are the best - super open and full of suggestions for stuff to do in and around denver. they even might be willing to hang out with you when they&#039;re off work and help give an awesome local perspective.
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,2,10,10,10,10,10,i absolutely loved this place. the art decor the ambieance it&#039;s just dope. theres a killer bar inside and lounge area. its located in the  heart of everything you need for a fun weekend. you can take the train straight from the airport to dt and its a 10min walk. staff super chill and go above and beyond for you. they define the &quot;up-scale hostel&quot; the only thing thats uneasy is that the entrance is open to anyone and a guy asked to stay in my bed b/c there were no rooms left not a cool feeling.
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"i called to reschedule my stay and when i arrived they had charged me for the previous night and didn&#039;t have me down for the newly scheduled night. staff was friendly and the issue was resolved. only stayed one night, but it was a positive experience."
Canada,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,great hostel. be careful if your on the third bunk... it will be a struggle if your drunk. 
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,10,8,"despite the noise high level of noise i heard through the thin walls and wooden floors, hostel fish was one of my favorites so far. great location, friendly staff, top notch cool vibe, cleaning staff+++, and amazing bar. i didn&#039;t mind not sleeping much honestly.. and they do provide free earplugs as well. make sure to go through their vinyl collection, and &quot;found&quot; treasure box on the second floor for a pair of slippers that make you feel even more at home. ah i miss the hostel already.."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"aweslme time at fish hostel! couldn&#039;t get a much better location. near the river, downtown, 16th street, a lot of cool dive bars, etc. owner is a really good dude and all the faculty i met seemed nice. charles behind the bar is the man. really cool themed rooms"
England,Male,25-30,7.1,4,8,6,8,8,6,10,very loud on the first floor. had a drunk man playing the piano until 1.30 am that could be heard from the rooms. beds were comfortable and toilet facilities where very clean. recommended unless on the first floor.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"for my first visit in denver, hostel fish made my experience amazing! i was really looking forward to the pub crawl since i had a great experience with it in europe. the decor and cleanliness is stellar! they went way above my expectation and the location is right by a bunch of bars. the artwork on the walls were to die for. i definitely &quot;up&quot; my selfie game because of it. during the pub crawl, i actually got to meet the owner of the hostel where i got to learn about history of the hostel. cool!"
Kuwait,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,10,8,6,"i loved the place. just make sure to bring your &quot;earplugs&quot; because you can&#039;t sleep at night without them, otherwise its a good place to stay in. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was very impressed with this hostel, and will be staying at hostel fish again the next time i visit denver. great staff and very clean bathrooms. the price was not a hostel price, but here, you get what you pay for. perfect for people who want the cleanliness of a hotel, but the mix of fellow travellers found in a normal hostel. and the bar was chill!"
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"planned on staying only a night, ended up staying for 3. when we first pulled up, i hopped on google maps to see what was nearby, and the screen lit up like a christmas tree. staff was awesome and approachable; charles and nick both gave us great recommendations as they manned the desk and the bar(located in the hostel). sits above a great club/restaurant, and walking distance to great divide brewery as well as 4 or 5 other breweries, get a dabba discount next door! "
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10,8,10,10,10,8,10,"only a few blocks from cooks field. great location, rooms were extremely clean. wonderful staff and owner. nic was extremely helpful and making suggestions for places to eat and hang out for night life. my one thing i do rave about is the toilet paper! it&#039;s multi ply and super soft, mostly unheard-of in hostels and most hotels. would recommend! "
Ireland,Female,25-30,9.1,4,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fab hostel really loved the style and vibe of this place. the beds are really comfy with great blankets. but like most hostels in the states it is way over priced. i feel its crazy to charge that amount for a 9 bed dorm especially if you are going to get a bump thats 3 beds high. it does have a great bar, is located above a very funky restaurant and is walking distance to union station and city centre "
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the cleanliness was exceptional, great bar with cheap drinks makes for an awesome association area! will be back for sure. "
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"really nicely decorated location! i enjoyed the décor of the rooms and the staff was very nice and friendly. i was allowed to store my bags for free while i toured denver, and everything was very comfortable. the beds are also very comfortable. it was very centrally located to the main downtown train station, and it was super easy to find. overall, it was a great stay!"
Australia,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,pretty much the best hostel i&#039;ve stayed at yet. the staff rule!
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"can&#039;t say enough how much i enjoyed my stay here. great location, great staff and great facilities. 10/10 anytime i stay in denver i&#039;ll make sure to pop back in for a night or two."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,stayed overnight on a saturday and was very pleased with fish hostel.  definitely one of the cleanest and posh hostel i&#039;ve been in!  highly recommend. 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was the nicest hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed in and it had amazing staff with a great location.
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"very good hostel, staff very friendly and helpful.i`d definitely recomed it! "
Netherlands,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing place. highly recommended.
Australia,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"one of the cleanest hostels i&#039;ve been to. super neat and tidy(although they were super quiet so i&#039;d expect it to be) rooms all had a different theme, which was cool and i had the whole room to myself for the stay! it was nice! highly recommend!! "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,10,10,6,8,stayed in a 6 bed dorm for one night. clean bathrooms and beds. nice staff at the front desk. breakfast was good. only stayed one night and it didn&#039;t seem like a super social place. 
Argentina,Male,25-30,9.4,8,8,10,10,10,10,10,"great staff, amazing atmosphere, location could not be better. highly recommended! "
Japan,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,perfect!  but no breakfast.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such an awesome place. everyone is super happy and friendly. just amazing. definitely stay here. i can&#039;t really describe how awesome it is, you kinda just have to experience it. do it do it do it do it do it."
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,it was a short walk from union station. it was the cleanest and swankiest hostel i&#039;ve been in! great vibes and people. i felt very comfortable and at home there. one of the best hostels i&#039;ve stayed at!
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,10,8,10,8,10,8,"nice place to stay for the holiday, i am looking forward to lodging here any time i am in usa or any other country again. "
Belgium,Male,25-30,8.9,6,8,10,10,10,8,10,"pricey, but very well located, friendly staff and original decoration/architecture."
USA,Male,41+,8,8,10,10,2,10,8,8,hostel fish is just what is says it is--a place for backpackers. i am an older woman who enjoys travel but must live within a budget. so i often use hostels. i read on the website about handicapped accessible bathrooms/showers. this implied good accessibility for someone with a lame hip. imagine my shock to open the door of the hostel and be faced with a 2-story flight of stairs! please make this clear on your website and remove references to &quot;handicapped accessible&quot; because you are not!
USA,Male,41+,8.6,6,10,8,8,8,10,10,"beautiful hostel, very clean, great spaces to relax, a nice bar on the premises! it&#039;s a bit pricey for a hostel, especially considering there&#039;s a no breakfast offered in the morning. when i checked in, the staffer didn&#039;t deduct my hostel world deposit from the price of my stay. she was dismissive when i asked why the deposit wasn&#039;t taken into account. said that it was something between me and hostel world, not hostel fish. i have contacted hostel world and they are working to rectify the issue."
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,6,10,10,8,8,6,10,"the place itself it very cool and the staff are great, but it is located above a nightclub - no guarantees of a quiet night&#039;s sleep. "
China,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,8,2,4,6,6,"i lived in a 7 bed female dorm and was allocated to sleep on the top of the triple bunk bed. it was very troublesome for me to get to the bed back and forth. also, the space there was not very little that i could not sit on my bed and had to lie down or else my head would hit the ceiling. the air-con in the dorm was very noisy while the staff at the late night chatted loudly. all these caused me have a bad sleep. the staff there were not very friendly at all that they will not greet you. "
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"pretty great place! location is killer! i had wished for more social space that wasn&#039;t the bar. the music was loud enough that i had a hard time hearing the person i was talking with.   bathroom facilities were nice but there was a bit of mildew along all the shower curtains and random dirt in the shower. kinda par the course but for the cost of this hostel, would have thought that would have been cleaner. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,5.1,2,6,6,6,2,4,10,"in a word, overpriced. if it had been $20 less a night i wouldn&#039;t have had any issues, but there was some basic stuff wrong which seems to have been compromised in favour of spending more money on decor. internet was patchy, staff were at best aloof, at worst outright rude, and the 3 high bunks made getting into the middle one very difficult, and rearranging sheets near on impossible. i couldn&#039;t recommend this place in good faith, feel they are monopolising on the lack of hostels in denver."
Canada,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,"just lovely. close to everything. great atmosphere, clean rooms and friendly everyone. truly was a great stay and thank you to chad (owner) for chatting with us, you&#039;re doing it right! my sister and i had a great stay. met lots of people and just love the vibe and decor around the hostel. pinao was a nice treat, especially early in the morning when played very soft and beautiful. "
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,"my flight was extremely delayed coming in, and i was only going to spend one night in the hostel.  due to the duration of the flight i was unable to make it in because i needed to be at the airport for my returning flight home in just a few hours.  i got charged the full amount anyways and staff were not flexible enough to give even a partial reimbursement.  unless they offer my first night free when i decide to return to denver, there is no way i am going to stay here.  you know how to reach me"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this place was awesome. it was super clean and great to hang out in. you couldn&#039;t ask for a better location either. it&#039;s right next to everything you need to see in downtown denver. this place is recommended to the max. 
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved my stay at hostel fish.  right next to a nice strip of bars and restaurants, down the street from coors field and pretty easy to find.  it has a nice lounge area with a sitting room, bar and kitchenette.  there is even a quiet reading room on the top floor and an outdoor patio as well.  rooms and bathrooms were very clean.  being on the top bunk was somewhat sketchy getting up and down so if you&#039;re not comfortable with climbing request a lower bunk.  a great place to stay in denv"
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"super cool hostel. great atmosphere, perfect location, cool style. was the most expensive hostel i&#039;ve stayed in. thought the price was a little steep, considering it didn&#039;t have a continental breakfast, like many cheaper ones do. however, it has a bar, which is great, and the location is so perfect that it&#039;s tough to find much wrong."
Canada,MixedGroup,18-24,8.9,8,8,10,8,10,10,8,"very central location.   great place to hang out, with a nice atmosphere, but can get a little noisy at night! "
Italy,Male,25-30,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,10,8,it was my first hostel in usa. it was great!
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,had a great time! wonderful everything.
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,10,2,8,10,"good location, well maintained, and seemed to have a fun ambiance. clean facilities!  unfortunately the staff was a different matter.  my experience with hostels has come from trips to europe, mexico, and canada.  recently started trying hostels in the us, this was by far the coldest and least friendliest reception i&#039;ve ever received. only information i received upon payment was the name and general direction of the room. rest of the staff seemed fine, but initial reception was bad."
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,"it was a bit hard to get ahold of the front desk. i understand they don&amp;#39;t need many people to run the place (bartender also works front), but they should have a bell or something to know that someone&amp;#39;s standing up front. "
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,"had a great time. friendly staff, friendly guests. most comfortable hostel bed i&amp;#39;ve slept in. location is awesome, public transport/dining -everywhere i ate in vicinity was delicious.  for the price would expect cleaner bathrooms and kitchen. wore my flip flops in the shower, also shower base has no lip and no floor mats provided so water goes everywhere then people walking through it leaves it dirty. microwave gross and fridge needs clearing out.  loved denver and would definitely stay again."
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,super cool hostel with great vibes in denver!
Bahrain,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i haven&amp;#39;t been to many hostels but hostel fish was great. it was always clean and staff were friendly and accommodating. it&amp;#39;s just a walk away from 16th street which is lined up with restaurants and shops. 
Slovenia,Male,25-30,7.7,6,4,10,6,10,8,10,"a social hostel with a very classy feel and an awesome bar, located in downtown denver. a bit expensive though for a hostel. easy to reach from the airport. very friendly staff. there is no breakfast included which would be a nice addition. one thing that i found as bit of an issue was that everyone could enter through the main doors facing a very busy street which should not be the case since people from the reception cannot see them immediately. however, all in all, i do recommend this hostel."
Australia,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,this was a great spot - the bar inside the hostel is super funky and the hostel is really clean and hip
Australia,Male,18-24,7.7,4,8,8,10,8,6,10,"pricey, however not fish&#039;s fault. no competition in denver for any other reputable hostels, or hostel culture in the us."
Paraguay,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,"i loved the place. i met a lot of friendly people and loved the decoration. every room hase it&amp;#39;s one theme, pretty  coool. "
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"had an excellent stay here. friendly staff, really nice accommodations, great location and excellent atmosphere. even talked with the owner for a little while. real cool guy."
USA,Male,25-30,8,6,8,10,8,6,8,10,okay overall.
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, super friendly staff, bar onsite...just keep in mind that if you drive you&amp;#39;ll have to pay for parking"
England,Male,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,8,10,10,"great location to explore denver and a good base for visiting the rockies. the bar has a great atmosphere and a good area to meet like minded travelers.   the cost per night is a pricey, especially if you end up on the top of a 3 bed bunk. "
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"located in lodo neighborhood, walking distance to bars, restaurants, dispensaries and coors field.  short ride to all the other denver neighborhoods.  staff was friendly.  you can smoke on the balcony.  plenty of bathrooms and showers, never had to wait for one.  luckily i got one of the bottom bunks, i would hate to be the third bunk up top.  also wish they had a basic complimentary breakfast (fruit, muffins, coffee).  recommended, i enjoyed my stay!"
USA,Male,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wonderful in everyway. very clean, neat, friendly and convenient, i would recommend to it highly."
USA,Female,18-24,6.6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,this placed offered me the necessities. i had a bed with clean sheets (i wish each bed had privacy curtains!) the bathrooms were clean. the location is great for walking to downtown and close to the bars! but keep in mind close to the bars means friday and saturday it is extremely loud outside and you hear everything! walls between rooms are thin. the common areas are small. overall i felt it didn&amp;#39;t offer much besides a bed and shower! not a big sense of community i&amp;#39;ve come to love about hostels
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,amazing experience.
Scotland,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing. very clean hostel with friendly staff. good location. lockers for every bed. good bar and kitchen area. toiletries, padlocks, towels available for rent or to buy. "
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"downtown denver can come across as an intense place, especially on an evening in the middle of summer when you roll in sleep deprived and disoriented from travel.  this place is a reprieve from all that…  cool folks, very accommodating and easy natured.   clean bed situation, clean bathrooms, clean public areas.  this is a well maintained, authentic place, in a world that doesn&amp;#39;t always have those qualities.   thank you fish..."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome stay! stayed in the paris room and the girls were awesome. everyone was super friendly and respectful. great downtown location, easy to access by public transportation. everything was clean and well maintained. next time i&amp;#39;m in denver i will definitely stay here again!! "
USA,Couple,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hostel fish is an incredible hostel in a great area of denver. the location, facilities and the staff are all fantastic. the staff welcomes all to the hostel and often times will hang out with the guests after their shift is over. hostel fish is a great community, we would highly recommend staying here and we would stay again if given the opportunity. "
Germany,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great location, nice lockers for belongings; no complaints!"
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hostel fish was great.  a few things really impressed me.  the bunks are constructed in such a way that you can get in and out of the top bunks without rattling the person below. this is a new hostel - and everything is really clean.  great bedding.  the group kitchen was big enough and had some basics.  this place is in a great location, and obviously there is a lot going on out of the place - a pub crawl on wednesday nights.  i would definitely stay there again. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a bit pricey when i booked but great vibes, clean and safe! lockers are quite small. "
Canada,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"amazing hostel in the heart of denver,    wouldn&amp;#39;t want to go anywhere else."
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,awesome hostel. $50 is a little pricy per night for a hostel but the place is sure not to disappoint. 
Canada,AllMaleGroup,31-40,8,6,6,10,8,8,8,10,"great location, great place.  love the vibe.      beds are bad and hard to access top bunks since it&#039;s warehouse racking. could see some drunk traveler dying getting in/out of those top beds."
CostaRica,Male,18-24,8.6,4,10,10,10,8,8,10,really nice and clean hostel with good location. just the price its a little high for being a hostel. 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it&#039;s was great ! one of the best hostels i have stayed here in the states, definitely coming back to denver !"
Canada,Female,31-40,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"great location, beautiful building.  overall i enjoyed my stay....my only issue was that having a room on their first level above the restaurant below meant that both nights i stayed there was a live band that i could hear clearly.  luckily i was incredibly jetlagged so i managed to fall asleep, but if i wasn&amp;#39;t this might have presented an issue.  next time i would request a room on their second level to avoid this concern."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,it&amp;#39;s very rare to stay in any hostel twice but for me hostel fish is the exception.     this hostel has to be one of the very best in the united states and perhaps even the world.    the beds are extremely comfortable ensuring a goodnights sleep regardless of which room you stay in.    the location is right in the heart of downtown and is second to none in terms of u.s hostels for its proximity to downtown.    but what makes hostel fish so great is the staff. they all rock!     10 out of 10.
USA,Female,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,10,8,6,"the service was phenomenal, the location was excellent, the bedrooms were decent (don&amp;#39;t expect any privacy though), the comforter on the bed though definitely need to be cleaned as it had a musty odor, like someone&amp;#39;s old sweat and the sheets had hairs on it "
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,10,10,10,8,"my mom and i stayed here for one night and we were sooooo happy with the location.  there is an awesome diner up the street if you are looking to grab breakfast, and lots of restaurants and bars one block down.  it is within walking distance of the train station and coors field as well.  the staff was very nice and had no problem storing our bags for us while we wandered the city.  also, these beds have to be the softest beds of any hostel i have stayed in!  certainly worth the price!"
USA,Female,41+,9.4,6,10,10,10,10,10,10,hostel fish was one of the nicest hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed at.  i have stayed at a lot of  hostels!  the facilities were suburb!  i do think they charge alittle too much for a dorm bed.  i think 40 dollars should be the maximum you should pay anywhere.  they make a lot of money also at the bar so why they charge so much for a bed i do not understand.  i would cost aside highly recommend this hostel.
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,awesome &#039;boutique&#039; hostel in the very funky downtown district of denver. nightlife in the surrounding neighbourhood could bother some but the hostel itself is quite. cute bar to drink in and a number of little communal areas that are pretty cool. very comfortable bed!! more pricey than other cities but well worth it. easy walk from station and most sites.
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,8,8,"honestly, it was great!  "
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,4,10,10,10,8,10,10,"all good, a+, but too expensive... "
USA,Male,18-24,8,6,8,10,8,8,8,8,"1) location is great (down 20th st. from coors field; 10-15 minutes easy walking distance from 16th st. mall)  2) clientele is young, outgoing and international  3) staff seems reasonably friendly   4) everything is clean and well-maintained  5) rooms are well-insulated from the noise of the bar down below   6) parking is a nightmare; the lot right by the hostel is very expensive (as much as $25 during events, but what can you say, it&amp;#39;s downtown denver)  7) price is a bit steep for what you get"
NewZealand,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"pretty much an ideal hostel. nice experience. no complaints. the bar was a good place to meet fellow travellers and the staff were all nice, helpful, friendly. definitely recommend! "
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,"very clean, well designed, and there are a number of spaces in which you can hang out within the building (general area, library, balcony, reception area). also, the wifi is very strong all throughout the building. free towels when i went. my only complaint is that the front door slams loudly. it can be heard on the 3rd floor. the windows are a little thin, so you can hear outside noise very well. however, it&amp;#39;s a hostel...bring earplugs. i had a short stay, but i enjoyed it. "
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,10,8,"this was the first time i had ever stayed in a hostel. it was a splendid experience. the bathrooms stunk most of the time which sort of grossed me out, but other than that i could not have asked for a better experience. staff was nice and it was in the heart of the city; right next to larimer square, the rockies stadium, and 4 blocks from 16th street. "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"fish hostel reminded me of being in europe for all things except the price . the facilities were clean , the staff was friendly the location was awesome ! all in all happy with the stay. the stay was just a little over priced, but still the best deal on denver "
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,6,10,10,8,10,10,10,"one of the nicer hostels i&amp;#39;ve been to. loved the open seating/bar/kitchen area. very clean bathrooms. very high third bunk, but manageable with outlets in reach and a small space to store items. fantastic downtown location! "
Brazil,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,10,10,6,10,the hostel is really good and has the best bed ever.
England,Male,25-30,8.3,6,8,10,8,8,8,10,"perfectly fine, but overpriced for what it is, benefits from the scarcity of hostels about"
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,8,6,10,10,10,it would be nice to have a teapot! and overall a more complete kitchen.   aside from that ... it was a wonderful stay!!
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"clean your bathrooms a bit more (plumping is weird?), but was a great stay!!! highly recommend. don&amp;#39;t stay at a lonely hotel, stay here."
Brazil,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"it feels great staying here. now it is my home every time i think about denver. the staff is pleasant and helpful, rooms are kept indulgently clean and the travelers that stop by will become your friends for life. also close to the bars, rockies stadium and 16th street mall. there is takeout mexican food around the corner for cheap and the 20th street cafe is just one block away. "
Australia,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,8,8,10,10,10,fish is a great hostel... showing the usa why hostels are such a great option. staff are awesome.    no complaints...a suggestion is to promote green sustainable aspect and add some equipment to the kitchen.    thanks chad and ask the crew. i&amp;#39;ll be back.
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i loved this place. everyone was super friendly. the rooms were clean and the bathrooms were clean. i was here on 420 and at night they played stoner movies on a projector screen in the bar area pretty much until quiet hours. there are some crazies but that might be because of the 420 crowd (i indulge but some people really should stay away from it). this is primo location also. i highly recommend this place and if i&amp;#39;m ever traveling solo i&amp;#39;ll come right back here. 
Australia,Male,18-24,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,"we booked this hostel last minute while sitting at the airport and i&amp;#39;m so glad we did. unfortunately it wasnt super busy so there wasnt that many people around but the place had enough character by itself. good location, incredibly clean and the beds are incredibly comfy.  we stayed in a room with one of the staff members there, he was nice and welcoming and had plenty of advice about the city. id advise anyone to stay here if they can, i definitely plan to come back."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,brilliant plac great location will be going again
Brazil,Male,25-30,6.9,4,8,10,8,6,6,6,"this hostel stays above a bar, so all the nights were very loud until 2 am and i could not sleep very well. if you&amp;#39;re looking for a party hostel that&amp;#39;s the place, if you want to sleep after a busy day just find somewhere else in airbnb (there isn&amp;#39;t many hostel in denver). facilities are good but the bathrooms could be more clean."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"hostel was great but found it not giving as much as i have gotten from previous hostels.  great people, bar and location to get to other bars.  however, due to location of the hostel, it was loud at nights when trying to get sleep.  "
USA,Male,18-24,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a nice, affordable place to stay in denver for a couple of days. used it as a base for my campus visit to du, which i could easily reach on the light rail network from downtown denver. great location near bars and coors field; lots of good food within an easy walking distance. nice, big rooms. clean bathrooms. bunk rooms were simple but comfortable; nice beds; lockers to keep my valuables in the room (with locks for rent) . staff were friendly and accessible at all times (even at 3am). +1"
England,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,10,10,10,6,10,"the staff are amazing people and very helpful, i loved the location of the hostel and it has a really good kitchen, the rooms are big and very clean, great bathroom too, the only issue i didn&amp;#39;t like is the loud music on a thursday to saturday night, you just can&amp;#39;t sleep with the loud music from downstairs unless you are here to party all weekend. overall the staff were awesome "
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"my stay was great, i wish i had stayed the duration of my travels.  it was comfortable, great staff, secure, great location.  next time i come to denver i will definitely stay at hostel fish."
England,Female,25-30,9.1,8,10,10,10,8,10,8,"really nice hostel. very beautifully decorated with a homey, relaxing feeling. sorry i could not stay for longer."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this place is exactly the type of hostel i love staying at. awesome staff, cool decor, a bar and plenty of cool people."
USA,Male,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,10,10,8,8,"really nice place, electronic door locks, lockers. new facility, all the beds and bathroom fixtures/showers are less than one year old (as of february 2016). comfortable beds. note that things can be a bit noisy, either from the hostel bar/lounge or the restaurant/club downstairs. requesting a room on the 3rd floor may help with some of the noise. did i mention they have a nice bar in the hostel lounge!? good drink prices, too bad pbr takes up one of their 2 available taps. great place! love it!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"stayed here for a hockey game at coors field, mind you it is so close to the stadium that after the game it was a tad bit loud outside but it was perfect. the manager (his name escapes me) is really nice. the only thing i would suggest as a seasoned hosteler would be for them to install individual lights at each bunk so the main light doesn&amp;#39;t have to stay on and people don&amp;#39;t need flashlights. "
NewZealand,Male,25-30,8.6,6,10,10,10,8,6,10,great hostel but pretty expensive 
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i absolutely loved hostel fish. the hospitality was incredible from the moment we arrived to the moment we left and all-throughout.  this place thought of every single detail, and everything you&#039;d want and need in your stay. it had incredible decor and a comfortable atmosphere. the owner showed us around and gave us a run down of all the great places to stop by around the area. he also showed us around and gave us a tour that one would expect from family. what an incredible place!!!"
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,6,6,10,10,10,10,10,everything was good  except the fact that they ignored the fact that i paid a deposit to hostel world and asked a full price upon arrival.  deceptive practice.
Australia,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,10,8,this is a great hostel where the staff ad owner really want to make your stay great.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.4,8,10,8,10,10,10,10,i travelled here in january and stayed for 2 nights. hostel fish does a really good job of bringing people together and creating a fun atmosphere.  super comfy beds in warm rooms. the staff were really helpful and had lots of good recommendations.  highly recommend!
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"you already know. great hostel. one of the nicest aesthetically. great beds too. nothing i&#039;d really change. the only thing, which is consistent with other hostels, is that locks $3 rent, $5 buy. why can&#039;t it be $3 rent, but let that be a deposit that is returned? i understand that would reduce your revenue, but i doubt by very much. that rule just seems more reasonable."
Australia,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel, we moved here after 2 nights at funkhaus which was terrible. should have come here first! facilities were great. we stayed over new years and the staff held a new years party at the bar. awesome vibe to hang out in and meet people. staff always happy to answer any question and chat. some really cool hang out spots at the hostel, loved the interior design! great hostel!"
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"everyone at the hostel was very friendly, the staff was very helpful. all of the facilities were very clean, the rooms and the bathroom as well. i was very impressed by the cleanliness. the location is great, just a short walk away from 16th street and everywhere we needed to be. i would definitely stay at this hostel again."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,awesome hostel..probably the best i&#039;ve been to. the staff was great. only suggestion is to get some blinds for that colorado sun coming through the windows next to the bunks in the morning!
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"very rarely do i feel the need to review a hostel.  however hostels as excellent as this one come along very rarely.    the location of hostel fish could not be more convenient for whatever you&#039;re doing in denver. it&#039;s only 1 block from the greyhound bus station, 3 blocks from coors field and is located right next to larmier street which has some of the best bars in colorado.    the location is only the tip of the excellence iceberg, as the staff are incredible!     overall 10 out of 10"
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,8,10,8,10,10,really great environment/location. the bed was comfy and the facilities were clean. i would definitely stay here again/recommend it to a friend.
Greece,Male,25-30,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,"very friendly staff, the actual interior of the hostel was amazing. from the outside it looks like an old building, but, boy you re in for a surprise. my hotel had a view of the skyscrapers, which is a new for me and i really liked it. adding the fact that it had a bar to hang out and drink your wine after a full day of interviews was so much worth the travel.   hope to go again there soon."
USA,Male,18-24,7.7,4,8,10,10,8,6,8,"hostel fish is extremely clean and what i would consider to be an upscale hostel. the location was incredible, right in the heart of downtown. the staff/owner seemed preoccupied with a party that the hostel was supposed to be hosting a few days after i checked out. the hostel was quite empty while i was there also, so the atmosphere was not quite what it could&#039;ve been. overall had a good stay and would recommend it as it is probably the best hostel in denver at the moment."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.1,8,10,10,8,10,8,10,really good location just on the border of lodo with quick access to local bars. lots of beerhouses nearby and the staff are lovely humans who are always down for a chat. great bar and one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in. great find!
Brazil,Male,31-40,8.3,6,10,8,8,8,8,10,"the hostel is very beatiful, but, i don&#039;t know... i didn&#039;t fell like i was at a hostel."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,6,8,10,8,10,10,8,"the staff were helpful and nice; the bar area was a friendly and inviting environment. the bathrooms were clean. the location was excellent. my only complaint would be that, for ~$50/night, it would have been nice to be given a towel and a lock for free, rather than having to rent them. it&#039;s a small detail in an otherwise great experience."
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location really clean and comfortable beds. very pricey, but most american hostels are.  staff were super friendly and helpful, nice bar attached to the hostel and the 1 downstairs is awesome too"
USA,Male,31-40,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"excellent staff and rooms. i had a great experience and i highly recommend  this hostel,  especially over the 11th ave hostel."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,8,8,10,8,10,10,10,it&#039;s a very new hostel so i understand that it&#039;s still in process. overall it was a wonderful stay and i would definitely recommend it to others :)  it would be nice to have more of the following:    - individual bed lights so we don&#039;t wake up others  - more stools/cubbies in showers to place clothing  - towel hangers in the rooms  - the handicap accessible shower in the women&#039;s bathroom upstairs needs fixing  - the lockers in the room were rusty and hard to open/close
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,8,8,6,8,"clean, spacious, nice lounges sturdy bunks, decent breakfast, and easily walkable for downtown denver.  be forewarned that there isn&#039;t great storage space in the room (the bottom bunk is so low to the floor that we kept getting stuff stuck under the beds, but not big enough to actually put bags under).  my biggest concern was that it was loud.   i woke up at 2am to people shouting next to the reception area and the staff didn&#039;t seem to be doing anything.  definitely ask to stay on the 3rd floor."
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"as a hostel operator myself, i can tell you that connor, euie and all the girls are really  the &quot;cool kids.&quot;  i loved the location and their readiness to assist with all my needs. beautiful place."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"highly doubt there is a better hostel in denver. great staff, clean restrooms, and a very enjoyable atmosphere that make sit easy to meet people...."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,8,10,10,8,10,6,8,"great staff, good location, a little noisy but otherwise very good!"
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,6,8,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a great place to spend a weekend in denver. i met many wonderful people staying there, as well as great staff.     the staff were available 24 hours a day, and were all wonderful. all of them were extremely helpful and made my stay very comfortable.    their new bar is open now, and it was great to be able to get drinks on-site!    everything was clean and comfortable, even the on the top level of the 3-tier bunkbed wasn&#039;t so bad, and was fun to climb :)    only downside, it&#039;s a little pricey :("
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,8,"staff very friendly and helpful.  a shame that the bar / common room was closed while i was there, because then i could not experience any &quot;atmosphere&quot; except at breakfast, when no one spoke. comfy beds, generally clean and modern facilities.  &quot;breakfast&quot; is just a warm gallon of milk and either froot loops or lucky charms, which is fine, but don&#039;t expect a full breakfast.  lockers were pretty small, and the actual hole to fit the lock through did not fit a standard combination lock."
England,Male,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic hostel, really amazing location and facilities, the place is clean and with a great common room. a bit expensive but you certainly get what you pay for."
Canada,Male,25-30,8,8,8,10,2,10,10,8,"amazing staff, perfect location if u dont drive. solid sturdy beds, super soft and warm bedding. met lots of great people here!    cons:   parking is very expensive downtown  new hostel so patio was closed, library closed."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"hostel fish is an incredible place and a must-stay for anyone visiting denver! i was blown away by how clean, comfortable, and beautiful my surroundings were. bathrooms: immaculate and clearly designed for women. bedrooms: everyone was singing the praises of the mattresses, comforters, and decor! the staff were hilarious, welcoming, and enthusiastic, and the guests were great as well. as a woman i felt very safe. the location couldn&#039;t have been better--minutes from all the best spots in denver."
Brazil,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i loved this hostel! one of the best that i ever had experienced. the highlights are staff very kind, cleanliness, location, facilities and atmosphere. very good!"
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,wonderful experience. booked one night to start and see how i felt and ended up staying 3 additional nights. helpful staff. met and made friends with people from all over the world. definitely coming back.
Belgium,Male,31-40,9.1,10,8,8,10,10,10,8,"i love this backpackers... staff was amazing and helpful. the location is very good, around the corner are the bars but the rooms are quiet. breakfest is included. the matrasses are very soft and ac in the room, just make sure you&#039;re not at the top-bunk if you want to go for a large beer cause they are three high :-p   i honostly would recommend this backpackers for every traveller. if you&#039;re ready to party or just want a good night sleep for you excursion to the many fancy things in the area."
Germany,Female,18-24,7.7,6,6,8,8,10,8,8,"i&#039;ve only stayed one night. rooms were clean, i liked the common areas, staff was very friendly . unfortunately the continental breakfast was poor..."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,8,8,10,8,10,really happy with this stay. fun rooms and helpful staff. a really pleasant experience.
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel has the best atmosphere of any hostel i&#039;ve ever visited. the common room is well lit by natural lighting which helps make it a very social place where you can easily meet people. the staff are beyond helpful. the rooms are amply sized and actually decorated, so you feel valued, not just jammed in the room like pigs in a pen. the bathroom was very clean and the showers nice and warm. also it is well situated within the city."
USA,Male,41+,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,4,10,"location is great. however, the hostel is situated above a restaurant/bar that plays very loud music at night.  if you are staying during friday/saturday night, good luck getting any sleep.  also, the clientel are not your typical hostel crowd. they will walk into the room in the middle of the night and start making loud conversation, turn on the light etc (mostly people not savvy with hostel living in my opinion)."
Canada,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,best hostel i&#039;ve stayed in!
Scotland,Male,18-24,8.6,6,8,10,6,10,10,10,very good location and has a great atmosphere. i met some interesting characters. definitely would come back - and i would recomend to a friend. i had to stay on top of a three storey bunk which was hard to get up on to and hard to get off. no lockers either.
France,MixedGroup,25-30,7.1,6,4,10,6,8,8,8,the place is great with good vibes and decoration. need a locker to be perfect and laundry service too.
Brazil,Male,18-24,9.4,8,10,10,8,10,10,10,"it is for sure a good option to stay in denver.all the employes are very friendly and they do a excellent job to make you comfortable. its downtown denver, so the location its perfect with a lot of restaurants and cool bars and clubs for you hang out at night. the place is nice with a good living room-bar, theres a guitar and piano for the musicians, a lp station with good stuff! so if you looking for a good place with good people this is it. its gonna be a good help on your colorado experience."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i absolutely loved my stay, however brief. will definitely come back to hostel fish again in the future."
England,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"fantastic place, great atmosphere, would recommend to anyone, patio is friendly"
Australia,Female,31-40,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this is a really fantastic flashpackers - problem is that it is so nice, that it&#039;s easy to find yourself sitting talking with people in the lounge all day (especially when it&#039;s cold outside).   this is a new hostel, in a really nice neighbourhood, which is fun to walk around and has easy access to downtown (although it&#039;s a fairly long walk).  the staff were all friendly, helpful and a couple even seemed to know lots about denver.   when in denver stay here!  "
Canada,Male,31-40,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,this is the most aesthetically pleasing hostel i’ve ever been in. the beds were comfortable and the pillows were still pillows instead of lumps of cloth. the staff were all amazing and friendly. there were some unique people in the hostel due to no upper age restriction. i was able to meet a lot of solo travelers to hang out with. i enjoyed my stay and would stay again. 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,such a cool hostle!! met the coolest people. great location. great staff. bed was so comfortable and black out curtains 👌🏻. had the best experience here (:
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"wasn&#039;t sure what to expect, but ember hostel turned out to be an excellent facility with a team that actually cares about doing their work well. i appreciate the cleanliness, character of the building, and the security."
USA,Male,41+,9.1,8,8,8,10,10,10,10,"the embers is a wonderful find in a happening town.  the entire interior has been remodeled very recently.  the dorm rooms are top notch and as good as any i&#039;ve seen with privacy curtains, storage areas beneath bunks, individual reading lamps and power outlets.  kitchen and bath facilities are very clean.  would i stay here again?  yes, absolutely; i look forward to it."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"walking distance to bars, restaurants, and trader joe’s. the kitchen was great."
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,fabulous decor  nice clean rooms with bunk style dorm beds. comfy beds with draw curtain for privacy.  fun themes through the hostel  free coffee
USA,Female,31-40,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,10,8,this was my first stay in a hostel. the bad points. there was some hair in the shower. and they don’t make your bed or change sheets if you stay more than one night. so making a bed that small with a bad back was hell. but. the atmosphere was excellent. the decor made me feel like i was in a 5 star hotel. hot tub and fire pit out back are just as they are pictured and felt amazing on sore traveling muscles. i will definitely stay here again if i come back to the area. 
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"ember is a stones throw from all of the city’s best bars, restaurants and sightseeing. the hostel succeeds at making you feel like you walked into a different era while maintaining a very high end and modern feel. the mattresses/pillows are super comfy. all of the staff members at ember were very friendly with me and were quick to offer great restaurant/bar suggestions and clue me into social events going on at the hostel. if you’re looking for an awesome place to crash, end your hunt here."
USA,Couple,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,we stayed here during our time in downtown denver. the place itself has incredible decor and amenities. there’s even a hot tub which gives you a great view of the night sky. the location was perfect - very close to everything. something i really enjoyed was that each bed has a cover that gives you a little bit of extra privacy. on top of all of that the staff is really wonderful and helpful. would 100% stay there again! 
USA,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"this is the only hostel to book...simple things like a curtain , a light and a power outlet go a long way to making your bed space feel private. only suggestion is that you need a bedside fan as well not fully for the airflow but mostly to generate white noise to drown out people snickering while you&#039;re trying to sleep...oh and add a grill!!!! do not i repeat do not book elsewhere...only book elsewhere if ember is full. i have been to those places...trust me...they are jokes in comparison."
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel was very clean and had a really cool vibe. it&#039;s a historic building but they have done a good job on updateing just the right things. the beds were comfortable, everyone was nice, they have a patio with a jacuzzi and a fireplace to hang out at. one down side was no breakfast, but they are still new (only been open 2 months). they have some parking spots if you have a car. the beds have a privacy curtain and all beds have their own plug/usb/light. overall awesome hostel!"
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i had a great experience visiting denver for the first time. the hostel staff were pleasant and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area. the facilities were modern and clean. i would recommend this place to anyone staying in denver. 
USA,Couple,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,"ember hostel is in a great location! i was born in denver, co, and during my stay, i was able to visit all my favorite places either by walking or a short bus ride. the facilities and the dorms were immaculately clean and comfortable, and the concierge and recommendations were very helpful. the only thing i would change is the volume of the music in the common areas. it made it difficult to concentrate and even harder to enjoy anyone&#039;s company."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the best hostel i&#039;ve stayed at in north america. everything is perfect. the cubicle bunks with privacy curtains and power outlets mean you never  have to leave your bed, but if you do there&#039;s a posh common room to hang out in. high-end neighborhood. trader joes around the corner and a real supermarket about 15 minutes on foot. 15 minute walk to state capital and 20 min to downtown pedestrian mall. agent cooper would be comfortable here. "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is just amazing, to the amazing decor, to the jacuzzi outside, the curtained hotel like rooms and finally the amazing staff. this hostel has everting and much more. thus far the best hostel i have stayed in while in america and will more than likely remain. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.4,10,8,10,10,8,10,10,"the hostel itself is beautiful and given the chance, i would love to stay here again. the rooms were really great and so were the staff!"
Mexico,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,8,8,8,10,10,this place is a really different hostel... the living room is just awesome.   each bed in shared rooms has a really cool/useful curtains that make you feel more privacy .  the toilets are really small but clean.  the showers are cool and clean.
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing, basically a luxury hotel!!"
USA,Male,25-30,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"i had a very nice stay at ember... dorm beds were very comfortable and well-equipped with lights, outlets and curtains. shower was amazing. the whole place was very clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. "
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"ember hostel is a relatively new, charming hostel in the capital hill part of denver. the actual facility is beautiful, the beds were comfortable and the amenities are great. the area can be a little out of the way, but not a bad walk to more lively area depending on the weather. i would definitely recommend staying here!"
USA,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"one of my fave hostel experiences. great staff and amenities. 16 room mixed can smell funny with that many people, but to be expected. "
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"clean, comfy, secure, welcoming. excellent hostel"
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,"very nice and clean place, definitely an upscale hostel to feel comfortable and cozy in. there was a water leak in my room so they provided a new room."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the rooms were clean and even if you stayed in a dormitory you had a surprising amount of privacy. it was by far the nicest hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed in. for its location there&#039;s no better bang for your buck. the staff were friendly, the bathrooms nice and modern (and most importantly clean). there was complimentary espresso and wifi with the stay! the wifi was good and the overall atmosphere was great! it had all the best characteristics of a hotel and hostel put together."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,very plesent atmosphere...highly recommended...
USA,Female,31-40,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"beautiful home with great finishes and decor! staff were helpful and guests were &quot;normal&quot;. great experience for my first hostel adventure! i felt comfortable and safe. bathrooms are small for showing and getting ready, but very clean and comfy beds! great location within walking distance, city bikes, bars, uber, parks and museums! will recommend and revisit! "
Australia,Male,31-40,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"this hostel is honestly one of the best ones i have ever stayed in, if not the best. the staff are awesome, especially paisley, and the other travellers have been a lot of fun to hang out with aroubd the fire outside at night, or in the common areas inside when it&#039;s too cold outside. if you&#039;re coming to denver then come and stay for at least a few nights, and you&#039;ll probably end up extending your stay!"
England,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it&#039;s a lovely building, great location, and more importantly the staff are lovely. one of the best hostels i&#039;ve ever stayed in (both in the us and europe). "
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,i lovvvvved this place. it is located in a newly renovated in a historic building. the decor is amazing. the location is convenient and safe. i was traveling alone so this was very important. the best thing next to the amazing staff was the hot tub and fire place in the back yard. i definitely recommend staying here!   
England,Couple,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"a beautiful place to stay! more like a hotel than a hostel. real thought and care have gone into the details of this hostel and the privacy curtains around the dorm beds are great! dorm bed feels like it’s own room with luxury curtain, quality bedding, lamp, excellent wifi everywhere and electrical output. relaxed outdoor space including fire pit and hot tub. relaxed atmosphere and the staff are really friendly, helpful and sociable. would recommend and would go back. "
Australia,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,the place looks more like a mansion than a hostel. i literally took a video of the inside when i arrived because it’s amazing. the staff and atmosphere are the best i’ve seen anywhere around the world. i couldn’t recommend this place higher
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"brand new, posh, cozy, and extremely comfortable hostel. the building itself is very cool and fun to explore. best dorm bed i&#039;ve stayed in. love the cleanliness and david lynch atmosphere. "
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"pretty awesome place that feels more like a cool b&amp;b than a hostel. sweet decorations, huge hot tub and cool music. this is gonna be a new hot spot for sure. we had an issue with the ambient music being too loud at night and they were super friendly about it. definitely stay here if you&#039;re looking for a cool place within walking distance of a lot. we even walked from sports authority stadium."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"such a cool spot that brings all of denver into one location. i loved the decor, especially the old school train car style beds with curtains. the staff was so friendly and gave me pointers to all the great venues and cafes literally within walking distance away. oh yeah i forgot about the free coffee &amp; espresso! i will definitely be staying here again in the future, hopefully for a few extra days!"
Greece,Couple,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,loved the distinctive twin peaks theme
Spain,Female,25-30,5.4,4,8,8,2,8,4,4,"windows do not isolate properly, resulting in chilly and noisy rooms.   carpet looks really dusty and old, bleaching or renovation would be highly desirable.   electricity installation seems pretty old, i felt some sparks when touching heating pipe and plugs, a good check and improvement would be required.  in general terms, a renovation would do great to the hotel, wall painting, carpet renovation and an in-depth cleaning could improve the quality of the service by far."
USA,Male,41+,6.9,6,8,8,4,10,6,6,"located fairly near to downtown denver and other front range attractions. close broad range food choices from cheap tacos, pizza and happy hours to more upscale dining. several great coffee shops near by and the ever present availability of legal denver cannabis.easy to find. very friendly and accommodating staff. that being said- this is a bare-bones hostel. it is located on a busy 4 land thorough fare. high traffic noise. not the cleanest accommodations i’ve stayed in. no hot water. "
USA,Male,41+,5.4,6,4,8,4,6,2,8,"i was told this place had wifi it did not i had to use the public library .the frig was full of really old food, toilets stayed plugged all night.   staff was all right but not what i  call friendly.   i mean tourists are going to ask directions to food and in denver mj get used to it.   the bunk beds are really  cheap and make a lot of noise making it hard to stay   asleep."
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,8,6,10,8,10,6,6,"the location is great! walking distance from museums, monuments, state capital, nightlife and 16th st. easy to get local transportation, bus, etc. it&#039;s a very old building, more like a hotel than a hostel, so not the best atmosphere. the second time i stayed i booked a private room, much better. cheapest place i found in denver. "
Poland,Female,31-40,5.7,6,6,8,4,8,4,4,"unconfortable beds, windows didnt close properly, not so clean and no community feeling, possibility to meet people and hang out. more like a cheap hotel than hostel. "
USA,Female,41+,4,2,2,6,2,10,2,4,"staff was incredible. not happy as shower was clogged, other guest being noisy. i came to denver for a job. waking at 4am when other&#039;s in dorm want to be up at midnight was quite disrespectful. i could have stayed at a hotel, private room with a working shower for $10. more. never make the mistake of staying here again. not worth the $35.00 a night. felt like a homeless shelter. used the desk top computer only to have someone stand over top of me as i&#039;m trying to fill out my new hire package. "
USA,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,beyond amazing! such a friendly staff and such a bang for your buck!
Brazil,Female,25-30,8.3,8,10,10,6,10,8,6,"fair price, awesome location, friendly staff.   not the cleanest, but ok, and our bathroom had a bathtub–but not a standing shower, which was weird/difficult."
USA,Female,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,8,8,"great hostel. perhaps it still doesn’t hold a candle to a hotel room, but compared to the last hostel i’ve been too it was fantastic. i wasn’t prepared with a sleeping liner, but it was okay because the beds, pillows, and comforters looked and felt clean and didn’t smell at all. the bathroom was clean enough for me to feel comfortable showering without flip flops. i love that there were lockers provided within the rooms. over all it was great and i would stay there again. "
USA,Male,31-40,4.3,2,6,8,6,2,2,4,hostel world should enclose whether or not these hostels take debit cards with no names. i&#039;m sure hostel world and their four and change could care less .
Australia,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"clean, comfortable and convenient."
USA,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,6,8,10,8,10,"first hostel experience, overall pretty good stay. was like a mix between dorms and a fraternity. nice n clean. secure lockers to stash away anything important.     definitely not a party atmosphere, nice and quiet. unfortunately i did not engage too much with anyone, likely because i slept in hung over pretty much each day and people went about their business.     the location is kinda ghetto, but oh well for the price.  lots of homeless roaming around."
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"nice place! i stayed there for 3 nights. lots of street noise, but it&#039;s in town so that was expected. clean. very nice staff! internet service was a bit sketchy. common room was clean. they were installing a new patio out back. looked like it is going to be very nice. loved my roommate! hurt my knee, and the guy at the front desk carried my bags to the bus stop for me on my last morning and got me on the right bus to take me to the airport. i would absolutely stay there again! "
Germany,Male,31-40,5.1,4,6,8,2,8,6,2,there seem to really live quite a couple of poor or homeless people who dont make this hotel feel really safe. my room and bathroom were dirty. there was rubbish under my bed. the common toilets were blocked very often. streetlight in front of my window but the blinds covering only half of the height of the window so not really dark in the night in my room and noisy music club in the same building or adjacent. impossible to sleep this way. a very bad experience.
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great place to stay.  can walk to most tourist locations, including denver art museum complex, state capital, free city shuttle and local connection buses to other outlying areas.  easy to get to from either bus station or union sq.  easy shuttle from dia to dwntown for only $9.00.  5 blocks to most restuarants and bars in area.  near nightclubs, all swinging on friday/saturday/sunday nites. (so, don&#039;t plan to sleep those nights before about 3 am).  will definitely return during fall or winter. "
Netherlands,Female,25-30,3.1,4,2,4,4,4,2,2,"the place was dirty, the locks were in bad shape and the environment felt unsafe.  there were very little toilets and showers."
USA,Male,25-30,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"this is a bad hostel, no one should even try it out at all. i could not make it to the hostel as i had to cancel my trip after which i tried the hostel line but no one picked my call throughout the moment i tried it. they later charged my card for $30.36 which was a transaction i never authorized.     please do not try this hostel, they are a scam!     "
Australia,Female,25-30,4.3,6,4,6,4,4,2,4,wasn&#039;t a good experience. staff were not friendly. the manager was absolutely useless and argued with us about giving us our key deposit back. we had cold showers for a week! wasn&#039;t pleasant at all. i&#039;ll never go back and i do not recommend. 
Brazil,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,6,2,8,4,4,"nice staff.. mattress are terrible, shower is horrible, rooms extremely hot! location is good. "
England,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,6,10,8,8,overall a good place to stay. few more kitchen facilities would have been good
Canada,Female,41+,8.6,8,10,8,8,10,8,8,lovely staff. my room was clean and it was nice to have the option to book a single room with ensuite. i&#039;d love it if you could get the internet working. i could only connect very early in the morning for a few minutes and the same in the evening. the front of the hostel where my room was is on a noisy street just in case you are a light sleeper. i enjoyed my stay and would stay again. thank you. 
USA,Female,25-30,4.3,4,4,6,2,10,2,2,the staff was nice but the hostel was not.  there was a thick lining of dust on the radiator.  it had a dormitory feel to it which felt kind of dark.  i did not want to spend any more time there than i needed.  not really the best environment to meet new people which is basically the main point of a hostel for me.  the staff was very nice it just would have been a better experience if it the room was actually cleaned.
USA,Female,41+,8,8,8,10,8,8,6,8,"the hostel is convenient to everything:  good (as well as medium- and low-priced) restaurants, the art museum, capitol, public library, 16th street mall, excellent bus connections, etc.  if you can overlook the vagrants, who are everywhere downtown,  it&#039;s possible to say denver has at last turned into the hip city it always aspired to be."
USA,Male,41+,9.1,8,10,10,6,10,10,10,they could have warned us about early morning construction on property beforehand .    room was hot.    
India,Male,25-30,4.6,2,8,8,2,4,4,4,"they had my reservation for wrong  date when i arrived (12 july instead of 8 july 2017). had to wait for 90 min at the reception after the check in time to get a room. as an alternate, they gave  me a different room which had a single bunk bed. but that room had a little smell and it didn&#039;t look at all like the rooms shown in the pictures here. the plugin points in the room were not at a convenient place either."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,6,10,6,6,"location is good when it comes to going to downtown and union square, however this location is quite noisy. they open the window the whole time because they do not have an air conditioner. actually i could not sleep well during the stay in this hostel. except this aspect, not bad hostel for a few days stay."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,3.1,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,"the staff was incredibly rude as soon as we walked in the door, and charged me for a towel, which i never received after asking multiple times. there was no air conditioning, and no bedding provided. the shower flooded, and the lighting in the batheroom was terrible. overall poor experience!"
USA,AllFemaleGroup,41+,7.7,8,8,6,8,10,6,8,this was my first time staying in a hostel.  traveled with my teen daughter  the room was ok.  bed was somewhat comfortable.  not my stearns and foster but we managed.  we had a sink in our room with a place to hang items.   there was no ac but the room had a ceiling fan and there was a additional mini fan we placed in the window at night to cool off the room.  the area was a bit sketchy but we ok.  used common sense.  shower and toilet areas were clean. clean and on budget.  
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,8,10,8,10,8,6,10,"other than a booking miscommunication which was resolved as best the staff could without a manager working, our stay was great. it was clean and pretty well-located - we were within walking distance of many things, including the free 16th ave mall bus, also easy to grab a lyft. no ac, but a window and a fan was enough. we didn&#039;t hang out there, but it was a good place to sleep, and was a better location than the other hostel downtown. would stay again!"
USA,Female,25-30,6,4,6,6,4,10,6,6,"it wasn&#039;t the worst...but it wasn&#039;t all that great either. missed the part about no a/c...so if you&#039;re staying in warm months, be very prepared for that. "
England,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,5.4,6,6,8,4,2,4,8,during our stay here the staff were not helpful and it always seemed like a chore when you asked them about something - ended up not wanting to ask them about anything. this was what we first came across so our initial view of denver as a whole was a little clouded.  unlike most hostels this one doesn&#039;t have a community feel to it. the shared areas were usually always empty and you&#039;re not allowed alcohol in there at all (which seems odd for a hostel in our opinion).  stay elsewhere if poss.
Australia,Male,41+,9.4,8,10,10,10,10,8,10,"helpful staff, plenty of advice on offer, restaurants near by."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,really nice. 100% recommend 
Belgium,Male,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,"nice place to meet people, walking distance from downtown denver. facilities are ok but a bit worn down and not superclean. i would definitely return."
Germany,Female,25-30,4.9,2,4,6,2,8,4,8,- only cold water to take a shower  - internet wasn&#039;t working in the room.   - facilities very old.   - felt not safe there.     + kindness of the staff  + clean  + room size was big.   + a big refrigerator in the room. 
Australia,Female,41+,7.7,8,4,10,8,10,8,6,door only had one key lock no extra chain. window could not be locked and only had a thin flyscreens and outside was a set of stairs leading right up to the window. didn&#039;t feel that safe to be honest.    soap dish in shower needed for safety- slippery on bath floor as that&#039;s where it kept ending up.    otherwise happy with accommodation.
Brazil,Male,31-40,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,good price for the service that they offer!
CzechRepublic,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"i spent 9 days in denver. since my late arrival (after midnight) to the 11th avenue hostel i was very friendly accepted and received all necessary information.  the hostel is idealy located to the center of the city with walking distance to many museums, galeries, state capitol and other places of interest. the valuables could be locked in the individually owned locker inside the sleeping room. kitchen is available, and i never had problems to boil my water for tea or coffee. maybe more mugs and"
USA,Female,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,"loved the old hotel feel of the building and the location is not bad either. the only thing that was missing was a decent social, meeting-new-people atmosphere and a comfortable lounge or common area for hanging out. i agree with other reviewers that 11th ave is run more like a hotel than hostel. for my purposes - a one night stop over between travelling - that was just fine, but if you are looking to stay long term and/or meet other backpackers/travellers, i feel like it could get kinda lonely."
USA,Female,41+,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"the staff was amazing; friendly and helpful! the hostel is in a good neighborhood within walking distance to all necessities. i was in a 4-bed female dorm room and the space was huge; the largest dorm room i have ever been in complete with a bathroom, table and chairs, tv, fridge, and microwave. it was like an apartment. the only complaint i have was the bed - a really thin mattress coupled with a piece of bed. totally worth it since everything else was fabulous!"
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,8,10,10,"solid place to stay, very clean. sucks that there isn&#039;t designated free parking though, only meters. "
Canada,Female,31-40,4.9,2,4,8,4,8,4,4,"i was in a single room with ensuite bathroom.  the lock on the door was extremely poor and looked as though it was been damaged and poorly repaired. there was no deadbolt or chain on the door.  the room needed a thorough scrubbing and cleaning. the sheets were clean but the floor was stained in various areas, ripped and in need of repair.   the bathroom needed a good cleaning as well. baseboards and corners where filthy. the sink was badly rusted and the hot water took several minutes to flow."
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,8,4,8,"security: lockers too small.  location: great! center of &quot;golden triangle&quot; for museums, etc.  staff: younger staff were nice! the older, stout guy was kinda grouchy.  atmosphere: bland. just felt like a cheap hotel (it was).    suggestions: needs more tourist info and knowledgable staff - walking tours, bike tours, bars/breweries/club suggestions, happier and more atmosphere, community engagement, pub crawls, a bar with happy hour, events.    this place was more run as a cheap hotel than a hostel."
USA,Female,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,check in was friendly and quick. they checked in my bad and held it for me while i went to my conference.  the room was clean and the showers were hot!  great value for the price. thanks!  
Germany,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,6.6,6,8,4,6,8,8,6,"hm, it was ok, but i expected more for the price. i didn&#039;t feel very safe walking in the early morning or after it got dark (lots of homeless people close by). i barely got some sleep on the weekend, as a bar and a club is closely and people on the streets were loud at night. yeah, i have seen never and cleaner hostels before. "
Canada,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"the aesthetics (read wall murals) are a bit strange though not off putting, but the place was extremely tidy, the staff very pleasant and helpful and the price was great. i was in a 4 bed female dorm. we had our own bathroom, a microwave, mini fridge, tv and dining table. the lockers in the room were great for storing valuables during the day. i didn&#039;t have a chance to explore much of the facilities so can&#039;t comment much on them. the only thing i would have loved is an early morning cafe."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"amazing staff. on the night of saturday, january 28 i got extremely sick and the two men working at the front desk went above and beyond their responsibilities to make sure i was well taken care of - they called an ambulance and gave me food to munch on. thank you so much. the location is absolutely fantastic, there is plenty of parking around the area, and the hostel is clean and quiet. can&#039;t say enough about this place. "
England,Male,41+,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,"the staff were without doubt the best i have encountered in my many stays in hostels.i arrived at 1000 am but checkin wasn&#039;t until 2 pm but they made an exception because i had been on the road for 4 days,tired,smelly and ready to drop.great staff and great value.will always recommend this place."
Canada,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,8,6,overall great for the price. not really any complaints.
USA,Male,31-40,3.7,2,6,6,2,2,2,6,staff was rude. loud construction at 8 a.m. floors creeks horribly. expensive. overall all a horrible automosphere which makes european hostels look like modern era cathedrals. 
Mexico,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great place. pretty cool and friendly staff. 
Thailand,Male,31-40,8.6,6,10,10,6,10,8,10,i love the place . i love restroom so clean and good section . but when ppl. walked it make some noisey . but not a problem with that . living room is big and so relaxing . i love big screen lcd. tv.  
CostaRica,Male,25-30,7.1,6,8,10,6,2,8,10,the receptionist was super rude. no the black girl... she es awesome!!!! that the another one was always in bad mood and kissing with her boyfriend in front everybody i do not know if in her work time. terrible!!
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,great location for anyone interested in denver&#039;s downtown museums (art and history) plus close to the downtown restaurant/nightclub/performing arts/shopping scene.
USA,Female,25-30,7.4,6,8,8,6,10,6,8,"this hostel had a weird vibe...it seemed that there were long term guests that live in the hostel, many seniors. i was not bothered by this but it should be noted that this isn&#039;t a youth hostel. the beds are the worst i&#039;ve ever experienced (sinking into the middle) and i&#039;m very low maintenance. anyhow it seems they are upgrading the space so i hope new mattresses are to come. on a positive note, the staff are incredibly friendly and the location is great for city exploring."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,8,8,"solid dorm for price, great central location, got around everywhere with ease...had some interesting roommates, not really the typical hosteling type, more of people looking to rent for extended periods of time while they were getting back on their feet. would stay here again, but if you&#039;re looking for an extremely active hostel with lots of cool activities/to meet people, etc, this might not be your spot. staff were great though."
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i really enjoyed staying at this hostel. to be honest it really surprised me because it was really clean and the location was great. extra points for having mini fridge, microwave, and a small living room area. it also have a communal kitchen. i highly recommend staying here."
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,4,6,8,6,6,6,8,"the lobby of the hostel is nicely decorated, but the rooms could use an update.  it is clean, and the beds are comfy enough. however, my room had a dated mural, and the furniture looked like it was picked from someone&#039;s curbside. the couch was very worn out. the tv had no remote. the windows in my room were misaligned, so it let in a lot of noise (could very clearly hear outside pedestrian/ vehicular traffic).   if you are not looking for anything special, then this is a decent place to stay."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,great value for the price!
USA,Male,41+,7.7,10,6,8,6,10,6,8,great friendly staff.  but older building needs repairs. still a great value for low budget.   bathroom needs:  door threshold repair (screws sticking up)  leaking faucet repair  sink stopper and sink rust removal  bathtub mat and grab bar to prevent falls  mirror over sink to shave  towel bar or hook  room carpet has sandwich size hole  window needs seal to stop some street noise when closed
Spain,Female,31-40,9.7,10,8,10,10,10,10,10,awesom. i am looking forward to coming back as soon as i can
USA,Couple,41+,8.3,8,6,10,6,10,8,10,this was our first hostel. we don&#039;t have any comparison to other hostels. it was noisy outside but too warm inside to keep the windows closed. otherwise it was ok.
USA,Male,41+,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,old building but clean. just microwave in kitchen. does not seem to be a travelers hostel but more local people. bunk beds old that squeak and rattle
Australia,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,10,8,"fantastic place to stay at! it was close to the city centre, there was wifi, fridge,ensuite and tv in each room. i felt like i was at a classy hostel! staff were very helpful and friendly. "
USA,Male,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,absolutely horrible.  requested a bottom bunk and when i got back for the night someone was sleeping in my bunk.  the front desk would not do anything about it.  pillow was as comfortable as a blanket would have been.  ended up checking out the next morning and booking a new place.  this place is the worst hostel i have stayed in anywhere in the world.  
Germany,Male,41+,7.4,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,"helpful staff tries to help with finding places for whoever looks just a bit disoriented. the place is rather old, but refurbished. rooms to the front and side street get lots of noise until early morning hours from traffic and nightclubs.  between the place and downtown there&#039;s a park frequented by drug users and homeless people - not necessarily something for everyone to pass through."
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location right downtown. 5 minute walk to 16th street mall area. there&#039;s a free bus that circles around downtown. close to museums, restaurants and music venues. no stove/oven, but a toaster oven and a refrigerator. the showers were really clean. no flip flops needed. the staff were all super friendly. i&#039;d stay there again."
USA,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great place, great location, friendly staff, thank you."
USA,Female,18-24,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"there is another hostel in denver that is closer to downtown, but it can&#039;t beat the value of this. i was alone on my trip, and never once questioned my safety. the beds were comfortable, and bathroom clean. the staff were really friendly, and always willing to help when i needed it. i stayed in a female dorm, so i can&#039;t attest to the cleanliness of other room types, but i didn&#039;t see anything awry while walking around. very close to several restaurants. great value, and would definitely recommend"
USA,Female,41+,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,i wanted a place near the denver art museum that did not cost an arm and a leg and the 11th ave hotel was the place! i took the train and &quot;0&quot; bus   to the 11th street hotel and it was easy.the bathrooms are clean but the furniture is past it&#039;s prime but comortable. i felt comfortable there with the   usual precautions you would take anywhere. i am a light sleeper and asked for a room off broadway and it worked out fine. i would return.
Australia,Couple,25-30,6.9,8,6,10,6,6,6,6,simple and basic accomodation in a great location. similar to hostel accomodation without the sociability and facilities (kitchen) of a hostel. 
USA,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"awesome hostel! probably one of the best hostels i&amp;#39;ve stayed in. i was in a 6 bed shared girls dorm. it had a sleeping area on one side and a tv, chairs, vanity, and fridge on the other as well as a private bathroom for the room. very spacious, which is unusual for a shared dorm. lockers with locks were even provided. just a good place. staff was friendly and knowledgeable. the only thing they don&amp;#39;t provide is a towel- there is a $3 (i think) cost for it. i remembered to bring one thought. "
England,AllMaleGroup,25-30,7.4,10,8,6,8,4,6,10,"all good apart from a few nutters hanging around, also a certain 29 year old receptionist could also be a bit abrupt at times."
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,6,4,6,4,"this hostel was in a very good location. the reviews and photos online looked good, but we were a bit disappointed. the common areas were limited, small, and seemed unused. the staff member who greeted us was a bit short-tempered. the room we stayed in had a strong smoke odor. we were looking for something more affordable than a hotel, but this felt like it was barely cheaper and was missing a number of amenities (like towels, for example) that it seemed reasonable to include for the price."
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,8,8,6,6,8,6,4,"cheap place, but it has a lot of long term guests and the rooms smell like old gym socks and stale sweat."
Brazil,MixedGroup,25-30,5.7,4,6,8,6,6,4,6,"i had some issues with my reservation. it was made for three people in a private bedroom. however, when we got to the place, we were assigned to a bedroom that could fit only two people and that they did not have a three bedroom spot. &amp;#34;the hostelword website always make this mistake&amp;#34;. we were forced to pay a little more money to get a different private room."
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"great hostel in great location. easy to access the city centre. room was more like a hotel room which was really comfortable and nice after travelling for a while. staff were very helpful. only critique is that the wifi wasn&amp;#39;t always working the best at nighttime, and people tended to stick to themselves outside of the room. "
Australia,Female,25-30,5.4,4,6,6,4,6,6,6,no air con or ceiling fan - just a tiny table fan. the room was hot during the day &amp; night.   wifi kept dropping out.  a light from a storage room right next to ours was left on 24/7 so our room was bright all night due to it coming through the connecting bedroom window.  staff were nice &amp; location was close to 16th street mall so very convienient.  
Netherlands,Female,18-24,5.1,4,6,6,6,6,4,4,"since the hostel is also a hotel the lobby is like a hotel lobby and there is no common room,which makes it hard to meet other travellers. especially since e.g. a fridge is in the room. i don&amp;#39;t think there was a kitchen. the stairs to my bed were broken and though the facilities were alright i felt that they were overpriced.. staff was adequate but nothing more than that. one night one of my roommates put their mattress on the ground and left it there. though that&amp;#39;s not the hostels fault ofc"
USA,Male,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,10,10,8,10,"the service, staff, accommodations - everything was great. everything except the dorm full of drunk twenty-something beckys adjoining my room. that cackling horde was up until 3 a.m. just being generally awful. reflecting on that cacophonous bunch - the clank of glass bottles turned missiles crashing into waste baskets and walls, the wall-shaking thump of malnourished bodies slamming full force against the door partitioning our rooms - i&amp;#39;m sure a gang initiation would have been more peaceful. "
Italy,Male,18-24,6,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,"the young women at the reception was just super stresssed and extremely unfriendly. had nevwe such a bad experience at a chwck in. the lady has either psychical issues or at least the wrrong job. rooma were ok, though a little smellly. location is good, bad facilities"
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,10,8,10,6,6,"ended up getting upgraded to a private room with my friend, which was a very nice surprise! the guy at the front desk when we checked in was very friendly and helpful as well. "
Croatia,Male,31-40,7.7,6,10,6,8,8,8,8,"the hostel is directly on the traffic avenue so if you don&amp;#39;t have earplugs or you are drunk or druged, you will not be able to sleep.  otherwise it was ok. also to less toiletts."
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,8,10,10,10,10,"staff was fantastic, room was clean, and community bathroom &amp; showers were well stocked and clean. super satisfied with everything; i would definitely stay again the next time i&amp;#39;m in denver :)"
Ireland,Male,18-24,5.4,6,4,10,6,6,2,4,"i had a really bad experience with this &quot;youth traveler hostel&quot;. i was put into a 12 bed dorm even though i booked into a 6. it seemed as though a number of the other occupants in the room, gentlemen in their 50&#039;s, were long term renters, far from the &quot;youth travelers&quot; i was expecting. there was even one guy who appeared to have an ankle bracelet on! the room smelled terrible, i only had one piece of bed linen and there was zero ventilation. i endured 1 night of my scheduled 3 and got a refund!"
USA,Female,18-24,6.6,6,6,8,6,8,4,8,"overall a decent place - only a few minor upsets. there was no air conditioning, only a little fan and the window open. i stayed in the middle of july when it was very hot outside, so that made it difficult to sleep. but if you stay during a cooler time of year you would be just fine. since we slept with the window open, the loud music from the bar down the street made it difficult to sleep too. i never saw anyone hanging out in the community room, which was a bummer. enjoyed my stay though."
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,6,4,10,hostel was okay. air conditioning would have been better versus just a fan. it was inconvenient to leave the window open to air out the room because there&#039;s a lot of loud motorcyclists and cars that drive through broadway at night.   it seems like there are people that live in the hotel portion of the building. weird vibe. would probably spend a extra couple of bucks to rent an airbnb next time. 
USA,Couple,25-30,5.1,4,6,8,4,6,4,4,"it was just barely alright overall. although no ac in the private room, an extremely loud fan, hot during the night leaving me with no option but to leave the window open. it was very loud outside. the bed has plastic under the sheets and was below average in comfort. kind of expensive for what i got in my opinion. very good, central, downtown location though!"
USA,Male,41+,4.9,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,"the at this location refused my reservation, because i was only to stay 14 days.  i am working veteran, so this tells me that your organization has respect for us veterans, now that i am homeless, because i not afford the unreasonable hotel rates.  also i was not able to my deposit return to me.  what a scam!!!!!!!!!!!  i recommend that any stay at this hotel.  especially since your organization hates or has respect for veterans, who have served this country."
SouthKorea,Male,25-30,6,4,6,10,4,10,4,4,ok with me
USA,Male,41+,7.1,8,10,8,4,6,4,10,"not a bad place for a cheap private room, but needs improvement. the common bathrooms need more hooks for clothes and some towel racks. the &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; has a microwave nut no stove top or oven and lacks even a water boiler for tea. the no guests ever policy caught me off guard since i had paid for a double room, many of which were occupied by two people. my one friend had to sneak past the surly night manager and up the stairs to stop by for 10 minutes. "
Canada,Female,31-40,6,4,6,8,4,10,4,6,bare minimum hostel. decent location just out of the downtown core. staff was extremely helpful and nice. bathrooms and showers and a little worse than expected but not unusable. 
Australia,Female,31-40,6.6,8,10,10,4,4,4,6,"hostel was in great location. dorm room was massive with own tv, fridge, microwave and bathroom. good security lockers in rooms. no a/c and it was very hot in the room with only a tiny fan. staff were not very helpful with info on local area and attractions. kitchen was not well equipped. no atmosphere. "
England,Female,25-30,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"after reading the reviews of this hotel/hostel i wasn&amp;#39;t expecting much and was slightly worried about what i would get when i arrived. i can happily say i was pleasantly surprised by everything. i was greeted with some fantastic and very helpful staff. the building massive with very high ceilings. the dorms have a private bathroom, fridge, microwave and living area in each dorm. so it was like a mini apartment for 6 ppl. very clean and private lockers next to beds. i would return. "
Serbia,Female,41+,5.4,6,6,6,2,10,2,6,"the location of a hostel is good regarding downtown and museums, and the stuff was helpful. the rooms seem safe the overall room appearance low but clean sheets and clean bathroom the common living space is not good at all, they let all the kind of people getting in and i did not use it. i left the hostel after first night..."
USA,Female,31-40,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,8,10,"great budget option in denver with easy access to downtown. there are several options for dining within a block of the hotel and a corner market next door. a bikeshare dock is across the street, so you can easily bike around town. there are also several zipcar spots nearby, so getting out of town is relatively easy. i had a single ensuite room. be advised, the bathing facilities ensuite amounted to a tub only. bring shower shoes and a towel. i didn&amp;#39;t know there was common room available to relax"
Australia,Male,25-30,4.3,4,6,8,2,4,2,4,felt like more of a halfway house with a few travelers in it. useless kitchen facilities you will be eating out 3 x meals. stay here if your going through a divorce and need a cheap place to stay.
Canada,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,8,10,6,8,10,"had a good stay at the hostel/hotel combo. because it was a combination hostel/hotel, there wasn&amp;#39;t much of a community/backpackers vibe to it. my only complaint was that i was charged tax on on top of the balance that hostelworld said i would be paying (which explicitly says includes tax). essentially i paid tax twice here. the girl that checked me in around 11pm barely seem interested at all in helping me.the girl that checked me out wasn&amp;#39;t able to help but gave me a card to contact the manager"
USA,Male,18-24,4,2,2,6,4,4,4,6,everyone can walk in the hostel without a problem. rather expensive. poor facilities. no breakfast. 
Germany,Female,18-24,9.7,8,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i stayed for three nights, and we had a great time! such a good place, everything was clean, service was perfect and the rooms were comfortable! "
USA,Female,25-30,7.1,8,6,8,8,10,4,6,"shabby, though technically clean; never felt very comfortable walking touching things in the bedroom, however. very helpful staff and good location, but the windows faced broadway and it was very loud. even when i closed the lower part of the window, i realized that the upper part of the window was not blocking noise. the helpfulness of the staff was worth the visit."
England,Female,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,6,6,6,10,"agree with other comments that it&#039;s not really a backpackers hostel, and all sorts of people seemed to come and go. having said that, it was clean and my four bed dorm was massive with a tv and a couch. bunk beds were metal and super squeaky though, thankfully the room wasn&#039;t at full occupancy. microwave in room, which roomie used at 4.45am! i would stay again as it was clean, and fairly easy to get to by public transport but would suggest microwaves really don&#039;t belong in bedrooms."
USA,Male,25-30,3.4,4,4,6,2,4,2,2,"felt very sketchy the whole time. sorry, most likely won&#039;t be back."
USA,Couple,18-24,8.3,10,8,8,8,10,8,6,"this place was great value for your money and the staff was very helpful and friendly. the location was just a few blocks from downtown denver, so it&#039;s great for exploring the city. it was also a plus to have your own bathroom and tv in room. rooms are average, but overall a good experience at 11th avenue hostel, and i&#039;d stay there again."
USA,Female,41+,5.4,4,4,8,4,6,4,8,"borderline homeless shelter. my dinner was stolen new years eve. i am not sure the parents of young people woudl feel secure allowing theri kids to stay . ,,, cost of doing business are sufficient dishes, cups, mugs and clean towels everyday.  the toaster oven was dodgy, the microwave not powerful enough for the high volume use.  a stove should be a given for a hostel this size. word is changes are in the future that may alleviate some of the security issues."
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,fantastic hostel. the staff were super helpful and friendly. clean rooms and beds. nice hot showers and lockers were available in the male dorms. sadly out of no fault of the hostel there are smelly potheads. it&#039;s all non smoking but potheads wreak. don&#039;t leave food out. it&#039;ll disappear! 
USA,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"within walking distance to literally everything - just a couple blocks from dam, a few from 16th avenue mall... great location. yes, it can be loud on saturday nights, but what do you expect? it&#039;s downtown. no frills, but it&#039;s clean, and lockers are provided. beds are typical dorm bunk beds - they&#039;re comfortable! i&#039;d definitely stay again."
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,6,8,10,6,10,8,6,first time in colorado and i decided to stay at this hostel. it was great. i arrived at around  12:30 am and we were greeted by the front desk who was very warming and accommodating. the front desk noticed i  made a mistake while booking which he quickly fixed. towels are $3 a pop which is refundable upon return of the towels. the hostel is a very old but sturdy building. the rooms have actual keys and no key card. that didn&#039;t bother me at all. the neighborhood it&#039;s located in has everything.
USA,Male,41+,5.7,6,8,6,4,6,4,6,there was no shower instead there was a old fashioned bath tub. the tv was an old style also. the room was kind of dumpy. there was a lack of restaurants in the area. it was a 15 minute walk to the convention center. the heat came through an old fashion radiator.
USA,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,"i was in town for a convention and the location was great.  i had a 15 minute walk to the convention center through some of the civil buildings and museums in denver. the facilities were what i expected since this was a hostel. i stayed in a 6 person female dorm. my biggest complaint was that the building was hot. there were a couple of fans and you could open one of the windows, but it was hot. overall, the hostel was a good price and pretty consistent with what the reviews said."
Germany,Female,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,mostly nice and helpful staff
USA,Male,25-30,6,8,6,8,2,8,4,6,good place for the price.
England,Male,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"this is essentially a hotel, not a hostel. there are some big rooms with multiple beds but it&#039;s still just a hotel. no real facilities but the locations makes up for it. it advertises no parking but they own a parking lot one block away and you will be able to park there. would stay again."
USA,Male,31-40,7.1,4,8,10,4,6,8,10,"accomodations were clean and accessible.  misplaced a coleman led backpacker&#039;s headlamp and would like to have returned if found.  4510 harmony road helena, mt 59602."
USA,Male,31-40,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,"11th ave hostel is good for the money ,great location,close to things,helpful staff,good times"
Mexico,Male,25-30,4.3,4,6,4,4,6,4,2,the bed had plastic covers on the sheets. that is a red flag classic for bed bugs!
USA,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,10,4,8,6,6,the plastic cover on the mattress was super loud!! very hard to sleep
England,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,8,6,10,6,6,"the staff were really nice and i did really enjoy my stay but there were a few places that let it down a little. firstly the common room is a bit boring, not really a lot going on so rarely ever busy. could do with a pool table or something similar. the cleanliness of the room was very good, it was just the communial showers and rest rooms were not the best. and the wifi worked okay when i was in the lobby or halfway up the stairs to the first floor but thats it. not well in my room on 1st"
England,Male,18-24,4.6,4,4,6,4,8,2,4,"this hostel is more of a hotel - the kind of hotel that you rent by the hour rather than sleep in.  the location is half decent and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  the beds are cramped and uncomfortable, the rooms are generally shabby and there is no ac which makes warm nights uncomfortable. the rooms are not throughly cleaned and the small number of bathrooms to guests is a problem.  over all - i wouldn&#039;t recommend. "
Sweden,Male,41+,5.4,4,8,8,2,8,4,4,"it was my worst hostel i have been to, didn&#039;t like it, very, very noisy outside from the street, very bad then you have a room next to the street. don&#039;t stay here if you are in denver, try to find another place, i will not stay there if i coming back to denver!"
England,Female,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,6,10,8,10,"great hostel in a good location, very clean, only issues were no ac and internet was slow at times"
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,"for the price and location, this place was great. excellent staff. thank you"
Italy,MixedGroup,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,8,8,8,8,great location. clean. free breakfast and free wifi
England,Female,18-24,8.3,10,8,6,8,10,6,10,"the lady who served me at the desk was absolutely lovely, she called me by my actual name rather than not referring to me at all. really easy to find nice and close to union bus station, however there&#039;s not much around it and it&#039;s really quite loud at night. there&#039;s vending machines which are ridiculously cheap which is great, and the common room has all it needs it not over the top. for the price your paying the room is great. was really impressed with the receptionist customer service."
Scotland,Female,18-24,4,4,4,2,2,8,2,6,"too many dodgy people staying here, too scared to stay here on my own as a female traveller"
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,10,8,4,"i stayed for about a week while apartment hunting in denver. the location is fantastic--right on the 0 bus line and super close to museums, restaurants, monuments, parks and the price is fantastic. but you&#039;re definitely getting what you pay for. lots of traffic noise, no a/c, small rooms, minimal kitchen facilities."
USA,Couple,31-40,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,10,8,"great place to stay!! nice staff, very reasonable rate, lots of character in the room! a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and computer available for guests. i read some reviews about the broken locks but the lock on our door worked fine and i felt safe.  no ac but was comfortable with fan + windows. i would recommend parking in the lot behind the hostel instead of the street. we parked on the street overnight and our car got hit/dented."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"the kitchen, with fridge, microwave, and toaster oven would be improved if there were a proper stove to cook on and some cooking utensils and table ware to share.   maps of denver would have been helpful too.  weather was pretty hot, rooms we occupied were also pretty warm but we had one small fan for two people.  we took turns using it during our stay, but two small fans or one large oscillating fan would have been nice.        i hope you will add a stove to cook on in the kitchen."
Spain,Male,31-40,4.3,2,6,8,2,4,6,2,"no shower available in the room although tit was supposed to be an ensuite beroom. the room was dirty, it did not have air conditioning only a noisy fan."
Brazil,Male,31-40,3.7,4,2,8,4,4,2,2,"i have visited the hostel a few days before my scheduled check in just to realize i could never stay there. the rooms were dirty, with carpets looking pretty old, with windows facing a busy street. i got into the room without having to open any door with a key. the lockers were big but the impression was that everything outside this cage could be lost anytime. i didn&#039;t feel safe and never checked in."
Canada,Male,18-24,6,2,8,8,4,10,4,6,"not good looking at all (must be the same equipment it had in the 80s), beds are just ok, but feels sketchy in general, didn&#039;t feel really safe..."
Germany,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,"after the first night i switched from a dorm to a private ensuite room. there was nothing wrong with the dorm, i&#039;m just a spoiled geezer.  the staff was friendly and helpful while getting their software understand my extravagant upgrading desires.  the only thing i missed was more water pressure in the shower. but the employee who did my upgrade told me the room would only have a tub and no shower. so in that sense it exceeded my expectations. ;)"
France,Male,31-40,6.3,6,8,10,2,6,4,8,"rooms and shared restrooms/bathrooms are pretty clean. location is great, really closed to several museums (dam / colorado historic center/ ...)  and lots of food places.  rooms are not equipped with ac neither fans so it can get hot, moreover windows are not equipped with proper stores or curtains (at least in the room i got). you will be awake fairly early."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,8,10,4,8,"the vibes were definitely sketchy, but the staff was top-rate."
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,8,8,10,8,8,the staff was very helpful and friendly. the rooms were clean and it was nice to have a place to store and cook food even if i had to walk down the hall for it. i also enjoyed this place because i felt a little like i was staying at an old time boarding house. the rows of rooms just gave me that idea.
USA,Male,31-40,8,10,6,10,6,10,8,6,"first off, long story short, but i booked online for the day after i arrived. so, terrible start there. and the hostel was completely booked for that evening. i could hear the hotel associate consistently telling prospective customers over the phone that they were booked. however, he was super cool and was able to accommodate me after waiting for about 15 minutes. trust me, i gladly waited. room is fine. they left the window open though after a day of rain so carpet was wet. wi-fi is in and out."
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,8,6,8,6,10,6,6,"hostel staff were very helpful and accommodating.  this was our first time ever staying in a hostel, and we definitely wouldn&#039;t mind staying here again! great location close downtown in denver. walking distance to several bars, restaurants, and stores."
Germany,Male,25-30,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"all fine, affordable accommodation within walking distance to the convention center."
USA,Male,31-40,8,10,8,10,6,10,6,6,"overall a good experience with a few minor issues. the good: location was great for checking out broadway &amp; colfax areas for sure...the building is cool...the beds are fairly comfortable. the bad: it was really noisy in the mornings there, so light sleepers might have a rough time...and they had a routine spraying for bugs while we were in the room, which was really odd (and the spray smelled horrible too, so we cracked a window)."
Australia,Female,25-30,9.4,10,10,8,10,10,8,10,"i stayed for 5 nights in a 6-bed female dorm while attending a conference in downtown denver. it was my cheapest option by far. the place was clean and felt very secure. although not located in the nicest part of town, it is easy walking distance to downtown and the free shuttle down 16th street. the dorm was luxurious with two rooms including a tv, microwave and fridge. the bunkbeds were quite squeaky though, so bring along some ear plugs. staff were very welcoming. overall a really nice stay"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,10,4,10,8,6,the hostel was very affordable. had a friendly and helpful staff. really good part of town too!
USA,Male,18-24,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,nothing special about this place. only chose it because it was cheapest in denver. pretty good location and easy to get to.  if the weather is good then you can walk north and find some good museums and bars. i have been to 19 countries and hostels all over the world and this was not on the good end. stay here for a cheap room but don&#039;t expect much!
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,better common room!
Scotland,Female,18-24,5.7,4,8,8,2,8,2,8,"no cooking facilities other than a microwave in the communal room. no kitchen utensils (not even knives and forks).  however sheets were clean, the wifi worked well, good location and the staff were friendly/helpful. i just missed being able to make meals as i&#039;m on a budget and also the place didn&#039;t have a backpacker feel so difficult to meet people. expensive for what you get but i would stay again as it was clean. "
Brazil,Female,25-30,6.9,8,4,8,8,8,6,6,"central location, clean enough. there was a weird girl living the room i stayed in (screamed and talked a lot in her sleep, talked to herself while awake), but at least for the 2 days i stayed in she offered no harm. staff was friendly (tom, the night recepcionist, was specially helpful). security could be improved when it comes to the hostel access (anyone can go in and out - maybe a plastic bracelet for the people staying there could solve the problem)."
Mexico,Male,25-30,8,8,8,8,8,10,8,6,if you are in colorado for the weed well this is your place
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,10,10,6,10,4,2,"there were bedbugs the first two days.  the manager christ said they then sprayed and they were gone.  i still itched!!      this place is a great value and the location is in the middle of downtown denver.      forget the wifi and go to a coffee shop or library.  it dropped me constantly and that was went i could get on at all.     the beds are clean, the bathrooms are clean.  there is a clean rec room with a microwave.      they do the best that they can here.  and that is enough."
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,7.4,8,8,10,6,10,6,4,"very friendly staff, though it was a bit messy. also, i had difficulties booking this hostel through hostelworld for some reason: the hostel didn&#039;t get any notice about my reservations. so i kinda lost $9 by using hostelworld and have been too lazy to call hostelworld support about it. i don&#039;t know if that&#039;s happened to anyone else with this hostel, but be aware i guess."
USA,Female,18-24,6.3,6,6,10,6,8,6,2,"bathrooms were pretty disgusting. the room didn&#039;t have any curtains so that was a pain. staff was really nice and helpful, though."
Italy,Male,31-40,5.7,4,8,6,2,8,6,6,"not enough water in the bathroom, not enough heat in the room, not enough dark at night"
Canada,Male,31-40,5.1,6,4,8,4,6,4,4,"i have been to hostels before and was not expecting a 5star treatment but this hostel is probably the worst i have been to. in short the only positive thing is the location, so stay there if you have to. due to its downtown location it has become long stay home to homeless people which with all due respect kills the travel spirit of the hostel..."
Australia,Male,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"great location, easy walking distance from lots and even though it was freezing cold in the rooms you are warm as "
Brazil,Male,25-30,8,8,10,10,8,8,6,6,i stayed in a private room and it was small but was enough for me...the location is amazing for my interest. the only bad thing was the restroom( only one in each floor). but is a good place just for a couple nights.
England,Female,31-40,8,10,6,10,6,10,6,8,a good hostel in a great central location. the place is dated but is clean and has good sized rooms. the kitchen facilities are very limited with no cutlery or cups so you might need a plastic set. as a base this is ideal and i would stay here again.
England,Male,31-40,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,6,8,"can&#039;t fault the staff or the facilities, and the location is great. it does seem to attract a lot of stoners / hobos and certainly it&#039;s not a party hostel - it&#039;s a hotel with some dorm rooms. but for budget accommodation in denver it&#039;s pretty hard to beat.  nb they need to adjust their firewall, it blocked me from researching my trip to the coors brewery because it doesn&#039;t allow alcohol-related sites!"
USA,Male,25-30,6.6,8,8,8,6,6,4,6,"honestly not as bad as other people have been saying. it&#039;s cheap i was in a small room with 2 beds and a sink. i only found two bathrooms on the floor so if it was full it might be hard to get a shower, but i didn&#039;t have any problems. only complaint is it didn&#039;t really feel like a hostel, no sense of community, it was more like a cheap hotel with shared bathrooms."
USA,Male,41+,8,8,8,10,6,8,8,8,"in the back outside area, where you can smoke , they don&#039;t want you to smoke pot there. !?"
USA,Female,41+,4.9,4,6,8,6,4,4,2,"roaches in our room, even though we had no food.   the staff took a long time checking me and my daughter in at 11:30 pm when we showed up, about 20 minutes.  either they didn&#039;t understand the system or the system was very outdated, we had to check in again the next day instead of extending our reservation for the next day, even with a different person, it took too long.  the staff seemed more suspicious than friendly which was made us uncomfortable about staying.  no parking was offered."
England,Male,18-24,6.3,8,8,8,4,6,4,6,"the beds are uncomfortable and noisy. i think prison beds would probably be comparable. that being said, the rooms are large and spacious. the lockers are too small to put most things in, despite this being a hostel rule.     it wasn&#039;t a bad stay and for the price i would go back, however this is not a great place"
Mexico,Male,25-30,3.7,2,4,8,2,6,2,2,"its a homeless shelter... rooms smelling like pee... dirty... barely the worst hostel i ever visited... originally booked for 4 night.. we just stayed one... suffering an awful night with that horrible smell and poor cleaness, definetely not recomended at all... "
SouthAfrica,Female,31-40,8.6,10,10,10,6,10,6,8,the common room/kitchen had very limited crockery and cutlery and was not the cleanest. no shower gel or shampoo available in the bathrooms.
Ireland,Female,25-30,7.7,8,10,10,6,8,4,8,"lovely spacious room with an ensuite, lovely helpful staff, good price and location, no breakfast, no atmosphere, a lot of full time residents or homeless people living there, laundry machines acting up, good free bus three blocks up, nice park, bicycles to rent too"
England,Male,25-30,7.7,8,10,8,8,8,4,8,"decent place to rest your head, really lacks any atmosphere though! but everything else was good"
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,7.1,10,6,8,8,6,4,8,"i dont understand that issues the other reviews claim. i had a very standard hostel experience here. its most definitely not a 5 star hotel. its a hostel. expect warm rooms to sleep in, standard not very comfortable bunk bed dorm rooms, and common bathrooms in the hallway. the evening staff was friendly and helpful; the morning staff could have been better. ask to get the code to enter the common room. easy 10 min walk to 16th street area. great for a cheap place to sleep off your drunkenness."
USA,Male,41+,7.4,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,"not a typical youth hostel, despite first impression, the place is clean , safe, and centrally located.  it&#039;s an old hotel with remodeled rooms.  the inexpensive cost invites guests who are not typical world travelers but more like folks down on their luck.  the staff is quick to enforce house rules, keeping a handle on any unruly guest..   the staff was helpful and courteous."
England,Female,25-30,4.9,6,6,6,4,4,2,6,"the hostel was more for people &#039;between homes&#039; than travellers. though the room was a good size the atmosphere was kind of depressing, and the staff didn&#039;t know anything about local tours etc. denver seemed cool but i wish i&#039;d experienced it in a different hostel."
USA,Male,31-40,3.7,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,"please all who read realize this : 11th ave hostel is not a hostel, it is basically a halfway house, ( which is fine if it were mentioned in the review) the staff with few exceptions are basically lifeless,unenthusiastic, and more concerned with bizarre strict policies than hospitality. do not stay here."
Russia,Female,25-30,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,4,smth needs to be done to the bathroom facilities. a damp carpet inside the tub won&#039;t do.
USA,Male,25-30,3.1,4,2,6,2,4,2,2,"the worst hotel i&#039;ve ever stayed in and i stay in budget rooms whenever i travel. the bed was ancient with springs digging into your back. there was no climate control, so our room on the third floor was 90 degrees for the entire stay. the credit card machines were &quot;down&quot; and we had to pay in cash; no receipt was offered. we opened the curtains to our window and had a great view into another person&#039;s room; two feet away. the windows also were lined with chicken wire. real classy. stay elsewhere."
Germany,Male,31-40,6.3,6,6,8,6,8,6,4,this hostel does not seem to be used very much by tourists. or i never saw many of them. instead for many of the guests this hostel seems to be a shelter for homeless people or people with problems. generally marignalized people. that did not leave a very secure impression to me.  to my impression about 2/3 of the guests here were homeless people or people with problems. i can not recommend this place.
USA,Male,41+,6.9,6,8,10,6,4,6,8,"the female staff were outstanding, helpful, informed, kind. but the afternoon management and the morning day labor front desk dude could work on their people skills. i had to relieve them of the burden of my presence a (paid) day early because i was afraid that the third time that i get barked at in public, i might overreact. myself and my bicycle were made to feel more like an indentured servant than a paying guests.  could be a little more professional."
USA,Female,41+,7.7,8,6,10,8,8,6,8,i had paid the booking fee to you $6.95 and thought it was rolled into my paying the hostel but it was all just an extra charge. feel like i should have gotten a few bucks credit.
Sweden,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,good price and ok location. had very few restrooms and showers.
USA,Male,18-24,5.1,6,6,6,2,8,4,4,"there was no air conditioning, the third floor was unbearable. staff gave us a fan but there were very few outlets in the room. the area was a bit shady and i woulnt recommend staying here alone."
Japan,Female,18-24,6.3,6,10,6,4,6,6,6,"they don&#039;t have breakfast and reliable wifi network.  beds are small, and there are no air conditioner.    however, they have locker, so security is good."
USA,Female,25-30,8,8,8,10,6,10,6,8,"the hostel was in a great, downtown location close to many bars and restaurants. it didn&#039;t have any common area or kitchen that i could find, although someone said they existed (i have no clue where they would be and i stayed there for a week).  it&#039;s not a great hostel to meet people in since there&#039;s no sense of community but it was clean and well priced. the dorm rooms have bunk beds which i&#039;m not a big fan of and no a/c which made it pretty hot in the room during the summer even with the fan."
USA,Male,41+,7.1,8,8,10,6,6,6,6,"it was a great location, right between civic park and capitol hill, and very close to the beginning of the 16th avenue mall.  i was able to walk everywhere.  room was basic, but sufficient.  common area was locked, for good reason, but did not lend itself to the kinds of mingling one finds abroad.  for some reason, the staff was not very openly friendly."
USA,Female,25-30,8,10,8,8,8,10,6,6,"nice staff and a good location for access to lower downtown. rooms could definitely use an update (especially the ensuite single occupancy bathroom that i used), but overall this is a fantastic value. for $55 a night i don&#039;t need a luxury bathroom. though the bed, carpet, lamps, etc. were older, you can tell everything was cleaned thoroughly, including the mattress. my room had a tv that i didn&#039;t use but it was nice to have. those ultra sensitive to summer heat may find this place a little warm."
USA,Female,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,6,4,4,6,"i had apt of problems with this place. i left after checking in and came back to find someone else had been assigned to my bed and all my belongings had been removed from my locker and brought to the front desk. i was then assigned a new room and had to wait for my bed to be made because it wasn&#039;t ready. the next day when i went to check out there was no record of me at all, including the copy of my drivers license that was misplaced, so i never got the refund on my deposit, which was promised."
England,Male,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,6,6,4,4,"see other reviews re: atmosphere, it&#039;s an ok place to stay although needs a major revamp, but if you&#039;re expecting a hostel feel then you&#039;ll be disappointed. the location&#039;s pretty good but that&#039;s about all i can say."
India,Female,25-30,4.9,6,6,8,4,6,2,2,i was a bit disappointed as i was looking for a travelers&#039;  hostel but this place is not really that. there is no common area and the hallways have a strong smell of weed. the mattress and pillow were very poor quality but the 4 bed female dorm did have an attached bath. this was the least well kept/clean of the hostels i been to. the place is a bit sketchy so i actually felt better about having taken a dorm rather than a private room.
USA,Male,18-24,8.6,10,6,10,8,10,6,10,"it is what it is, a lodging opportunity for a cheap price. people who complained about this probably had ridiculously high standards like the marriott hotel or something, but it&#039;s just an average room with a decent bed and a desk. it totally served all of my needs, and i&#039;m really glad i was able to take this option up."
Germany,Male,31-40,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,4,"this hostel is ok if you search for a cheap stay close to downtown denver, which is in walking distance. it is not very clean, e.g. i didn&#039;t use the drawers in the commode since there was dirt in each of them. the bed was ok. really annoying was a loud ventilator on the aisle, which was running all night. the street on the other side isn&#039;t quiet, too, but that&#039;s not the fault of the hostel. it just leads to a constant sound, to which you have to get used to in case you want to find some sleep."
USA,Male,25-30,6.3,8,6,10,6,4,4,6,"this is an interesting place. it seems about half hostel, and half halfway house. overall, the place is fine. the rooms are adequately clean, and the location is very good. most places downtown are within a 15-20 minute walk. the staff is ok. some members are pleasant and helpful, others a bit grumpy and useless. the place&#039;s location makes it a pretty good value. as long as you&#039;re not too fussy, this place will do just fine."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,8,10,10,2,6,4,6,"really is a hotel with a few dorm rooms, not hostel-y at all. bed was fine and great locker provided but room very noisey next to big road. common room had virtually nothing to cook or eat with and no drinkin allowed which sucked. very close to great arts district "
Ireland,Female,41+,9.1,8,10,8,10,10,8,10,"a friendly, clean and well located hostel. the staff even laid on a memorial day bbq for the guests. right in the heart of the museum triangle and plenty to see in the area. although the shared kitchen is a little sparse on utensils generally the hostel is well equipped. i would recommend this to any travellers to denver."
England,MixedGroup,18-24,5.7,6,6,8,4,6,4,6,"this place is literally just a place to sleep. majorly outdated and lacked an atmosphere. the windows in the room were a problem, blind were broken so light came in really early. right next to broadway to very very loud! great location but a tad too expensive for what you get "
USA,Female,41+,5.4,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,i would have expected the people behind the desk to acknowledge me when i came and went if only to know they recognized me.  instead they seemed to go out of their way not to look up when i came down the stairs.  i booked a room there because all of the rooms in denver were taken up by a nursing convention and it never occurred to me that i would need to bring my own towels.  a little warning would have been nice and i could have brought a bathmat.  there seemed to be no rules on noise at night.
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,6,10,6,good value for your money just make sure you keep your money with you all the time. joe from nyc . went here for a nti
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,8,10,8,8,great staff and the check in and check out was easy.
USA,Male,41+,5.7,6,8,6,6,6,2,6,"it seems more like a cheap hotel than a hostel. the facility is in a tired, old building. as far as cleanliness, they are passable. some staff were helpful and friendly, while others seemed more like bouncers."
USA,Male,41+,8.9,8,10,10,8,8,8,10,"great location, friendly staff and above all a clean place. i would go there again for sure !"
England,Male,25-30,7.1,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,"good location, good staff. nice court yard for socializing. rooms are pretty basic, so if your after a place to get your head down for a night or two while sightseeing, then its all good. the lockers are small, so there&#039;s only room for valuables/small items."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8,8,6,8,8,10,8,8,"we got a private room with a double bed/shared bathroom. the bathrooms could have been cleaner but that usually depends more on your fellow guests cleaning up after themselves in places like this rather than the staff.  the staff were extremely helpful and kind.  bed was comfortable and clean.  the bars across the street were rather loud, but again, not much can be done about that, and i&#039;m a heavy sleeper. location was extremely convenient. for the price, this was fantastic, and i would return."
USA,Female,41+,7.7,6,10,6,8,8,8,8,"we got a room on the street side and we could not sleep with all the noise from the restaurant/bar across the street; the traffic noise did not help either.  ear plugs only muffled the noise.  we were able to change rooms for the second night.  it was better but there was extreme creaking from upstairs and loud talking outside, which apparently the police were called upon to deal with.  i would not stay here again."
Taiwan,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,i felt comfortable in  aae 11th avenue hostel. i would like to commend this nice hotel to all my friends who are planning to visit denver. the only comment that i can give is &quot;a small refrigerator in each room or floor&quot;.
England,MixedGroup,18-24,3.7,2,4,6,4,4,2,4,"although most of the staff were pleasant, an experience on our first night including physical threats of violence from one of the staff members caused us to leave this hostel after only one night, and only being refunded for 2 nights of a 4 night stay. like i said, some staff were lovely but this ruined our experience. felt extremely unsafe. would never come again. worst hostel i&#039;ve ever been to and i am not a fussy traveller. "
Canada,Male,18-24,8.3,8,8,10,8,10,6,8,"not a party hostel, but overall a clean and safe place to stay"
USA,Male,25-30,9.7,10,10,8,10,10,10,10,"had a great stay here for a couple nights. rooms were clean and had some cool decorations. staff was courteous and prompt. location isn&#039;t bad either. short walk to downtown, multiple clubs\nightlife in surrounding area. overall great value. will definitely stay here again."
USA,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,8,10,10,10,"ok, so it was recommended by a younger man (i am 71). i was nervous about a hostel,   but when i got here, i was pleasantly surprised.  the room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom and shower room clean.  there was always someone at the front desk.  and i saved enough money to make the trip affordable.  i give this place a good thumbs up!"
USA,Couple,25-30,5.7,6,6,8,6,6,2,6,tons of men who appear to be using the dormitories out of construction work/ homelessness?
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,4,8,8,4,8,2,6,"i would consider staying again, but others might want to know that it&#039;s more of a shelter or flop house for those in need than it is a hostel. everyone one is harmless, it might even be cool if i knew ahead of time what the place really was all about. i think it&#039;s part of salvation army (church) or something."
USA,Couple,25-30,4.6,4,6,8,2,6,2,4,"where to begin... the bathroom floors were disgusting, the bed was like sleeping on bricks, and the room temperature fluctuated from freezing cold to sauna-like. when we arrived one weekend in early october, it was colder in the room with no heat than it was outside. after 3 days, management decided to turn on the heat, which made the rickety radiator kick on every 2 hours, waking us up multiple times throughout the night. while it&#039;s a short walk to some attractions, do not waste your money!"
USA,Male,18-24,8,8,10,10,4,10,6,8,"heater did not work the night i stayed there, it was cold.  serious lack of restrooms and showers.  although there wasn&#039;t too many people when i stayed there, it could easily become a problem during peak seasons.  there are many bars conveniently located nearby.  there is a shuttle that passes by that will take you to points of interest, which is good because there is no free parking around."
NewZealand,Male,18-24,6.9,6,10,8,4,6,6,8,"needs much better kitchen facilities,  aside from that good stay"
Ireland,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,8,8,8,10,"location was good,  was right beside the art museums and 5 blocks to 16th st mall.  parking around the corner for just $5 a day.  lockers and locks provided in the room. i was in the 4bed female ensuite, it also had a fridge and tv. i would stay again"
Brazil,Female,25-30,4.3,4,4,8,4,6,2,2,"the hostel was dirty and smell of cigarette everywhere, including in the room where i stayed - the smoke of the others rooms where coming to my room! the smell of mold was everywhere also, and the mettress where very old and the beds very noisy. i just couldn&#039;t sleep one single night while i was at this hostel. and to complete the scene, there were many guests there that looked like living there, and weird people, what was very scary at the begining. for. sure i don&#039;t recomend this hostel!!"
Wales,Couple,31-40,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,6,8,"we stayed in a private room, with an en-suite, which was nice and clean.  the staff were helpful and friendly, with good advice about what to see and where to go in slc.  however, the hostel is not a backpackers hostel in the sense that you might think.  lots of long-staying residents of slc live there, so it doesn&#039;t feel that comfortable for backpackers sometimes.  the kitchen is small and could use a few more saucepans and utensils, but the laundry facilities are really good and cheap."
USA,Female,41+,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,everything is good. i am assigned to a bed near window where very noisy from street and transportation passing by. i wish next time staff accept reason of change bed because of noisy that people may not sleep well.
USA,Couple,41+,8.6,10,10,10,6,10,6,8,"not sure if they have private rooms that did not face the street; however, if they did, this would have been a great opportunity for the hotel to ask us if we would like that option - considering our age and length of stay. the private rooms in the front receive a lot of noise from the near by clubs and cars passing by making sleep challenging."
Wales,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,8,6,8,4,8,good location as it is only a 15 minute walk from downtown denver. i thought the rooms were a little cramped and there wasn&#039;t much of a backpacker vibe here as most of the rooms seemed to be private rooms. the bathrooms were spotless in all fairness.
India,Female,25-30,6.9,6,8,6,6,8,6,8,"if you provide breakfast, it would be fine..:)"
Taiwan,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,6,10,8,10,"the staff in the front desk was super nice!! they were quite willing to provide the information i needed and answer the questions i asked. the room i stayed was large and clean, besides, there are refrigerator and microwave inside. that truly surprised me. the location is not bad. you can get on the bus by walking about 5 to 10 minutes. if you are looking for a hostel with lots of activities, it might not meet your expectation. however, it&#039;s a good hostel for me."
USA,Female,41+,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i was greeted in a friendly manner, told where i could park, and upon my return from parking checked in immediately.  the only thing i would ask for next time would be to be toward the back of the building away from the main street due to traffic noise.     i really enjoyed my stay.  thank you!"
Argentina,Male,18-24,4,4,8,6,2,2,2,4,disrespectful staff. no air conditioner. baths not so clean
Germany,Female,18-24,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,they should offer some food. just something easy for breakfast.  they also should offer the opportunity to join trips from the hostel.  besides that a good place to stay.
Canada,Male,41+,5.7,6,6,8,4,4,4,8,"hello,this is a hotel-not a hostel first of all i came to the hotel during a heat wave.there is no air conditioning.okay they have fans in the hall and some in the room.in most hostels you can cook in a community kitchen.in this &quot;hostel&quot;they have no stove,no fridge?you have a microwave and a drink cooler to use?some of the staff were good but one woman behind the desk was &quot;useless&quot;she wouldn&#039;t help and didnt care period.if you needed any information from these people &quot;good luck&quot; your on your own"
England,Male,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,4,8,"there is no ac in the building and the top floor is like a sauna! they provided a fan upon request, but did little to cool the room."
Australia,Male,25-30,4.6,6,8,8,2,2,2,4,"good value for the private room, but absolutely no atmosphere. the social area is one couch and a bench for laptops in an area where u cannot drink. as a social guy travelling by himself, i found it impossible to meet people. even on the weekend there were no activities or outingsl   denver deserves a real hostel."
England,Male,31-40,8.3,10,10,8,6,8,6,10,"this place is not really a traditional traveller hostel (so don&#039;t expect big parties) but it is a very professionally run, safe and clean place to stay as a stopping off point in denver. i booked a private room and it was on a par with what you would expect from a budget hotel/ b+b. staff were friendly and helpful and there are some fun bars and nice restaurants nearby. a good base for exploring denver."
USA,Female,25-30,8.3,8,8,10,6,10,8,8,"i enjoyed staying in an all female dorm, but it still felt too much like a hotel for me. a better  common space to meet other travelers would be nice. the staff were friendly &amp; helpful. the room was clean &amp; conveniently included a fridge, microwave, table, couch, tv, sink, toilet &amp;shower.  great location, but a bit noisy at night--which didn&#039;t bother me but may bother some. at night the room was quite warm--again, didn&#039;t really bother me . overall i had a pleasant stay. i would stay here again."
Netherlands,Female,31-40,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,"we had a very noisy room, number 337. the staff helped us, but the noisy neighbour didn&#039;t do anything about it.  lots of residents."
Italy,Male,25-30,8.3,10,8,10,8,10,4,8,"don&#039;t expect a real hostel: this is more a hotel with not expensive prices compared to other places in denver. anyway, the staff is helpful and the location is good (few minutes walking from the most important spots). quite noise in the weekend because of the clubs nextdoor."
England,Male,18-24,6.9,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,nice place. bit of a long walk in and out of town so don&#039;t leave stuff at the hostel if you plan to need it during the day unless you want the walk back! might come back or might try somewhere else. overall a positive experience with no real negatives. only issue is that there is a lot of noise out front during rush hour traffic and friday/saturday night with nightclubbers on the street.
England,Male,31-40,7.7,8,10,8,6,8,6,8,not a typical traveller hostel per-se but a safe and secure place to base yourself for a couple of days when in denver 
USA,MixedGroup,25-30,6,4,6,10,4,8,6,4,"i was shocked that for the price of a nice clean room in most hostels we had a dirty, unairconditioned closet. the bathrooms and carpets were filthy and the rooms sweltering. we had a rickety bunkbed: thin plastic wrapped pallets on a rough piece of plywood. i have stayed in worse but those were only $8 a night, not $30. the location is great, central to everything but you will be staying in what amounts to a filthy dorm room. there is a $3 towel deposit. for $60 a night? no thanks."
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,10,8,6,6,4,"pros: awesome location.  walking distance from plenty of bars, museums, etc.  i wasn&#039;t horribly murdered.    cons: a little on the old side.  there is a security guard, but that didn&#039;t assuage my concerns of being stabbed in the hallways or my sleep.  the carpet in my room was moderately stained and i wasn&#039;t certain that i wouldn&#039;t get foot herpes walking barefoot on it.  the options include air conditioning, and if you consider a window that opens to be air conditioning, then this is accurate."
Italy,Male,31-40,5.4,4,4,10,4,6,4,6,"room pretty old and worn out. bathroom had a bathtub without shower tube and with tap facing downwards. had to shower with hands in cup, or waist tons of water to fill the tub. pretty awkward. "
USA,Male,41+,5.7,8,6,8,4,4,6,4,"my window was right across from a bar. the noise and music made it difficult to sleep before 2:00am. also, one of the day male managers was extremely rude. he had a very bad attitude problem. maybe some anger management training might be in store for him?"
USA,MixedGroup,18-24,5.7,6,6,6,4,6,4,8,"more hotel than hostile.  private room had windows painted shut, no fan or ac, so it was hot.  bed was made fresh, things were generally clean, just not very comfortable.  it was also noisy due to a tv being on all night outside the window.  "
Netherlands,Female,31-40,6.6,6,6,10,6,10,4,4,"nice people at the desk, very helpful and friendly.  bathroom terrible, old and not clean  first room in front smelled of car fumes, thankfully i could get another one that was much better"
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,4,6,6,4,8,2,4,very friendly staff. however the hostel was gross and dingy and did not have ac.
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,10,6,8,"the location is great.  i had read reviews with concerns about noise because it is pretty close to quite a few bars.  perhaps i was just very tired, but i had no problem at all with noise.  the staff is very friendly and efficient.  i was able to leave my bags behind the counter for the whole day for free so that i could explore the city before a late flight."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.9,8,10,10,8,10,6,10,"only stayed for one night in a private room. it was very clean, also the shared bathroom and shower. no aircon...i slept in my underwear with the fan pointed at me and that reminded me of my youth in italy in the 80&#039;s when very few had ac! not me...;) friendly/helpful staff. thanks"
USA,Male,31-40,6.6,8,6,10,4,6,6,6,"the room was fine but could&#039;ve used a fan and something to hold the window open, too hot! the first room they put us in had no shower head so we asked to be moved to different room with a normal shower. great location in downtown denver though! "
Scotland,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,8,8,10,a nice place to stay!
USA,Male,31-40,5.4,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,"hmm, well, it&#039;s hard to leave a negative review for a place that served it&#039;s function, but compared to the hostels i have been to in europe that had similar or lower price for the rooms, this place was pretty bad.  the staff was slow (maybe it&#039;s their computer system though), and would sometimes be working on the computer while i was waiting for them to help me with something.  the rooms weren&#039;t fancy or even nice, but they had beds to sleep in and bathrooms to use."
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,8,8,10,i stayed in a private room with en suite facilities. the room was clean. there wasn&#039;t a shower in a big claw footed tub so i enjoyed a few hot bubble baths. there is no air conditioning but i wasn&#039;t there to sit in the room. as long as the windows were open it was comfortable. however - if you don&#039;t like the sounds of the city or the sounds of other guests wafting up from their open windows - make sure you bring ear plugs. this didnt bother me at all. i enjoyed my stay 
Netherlands,Couple,25-30,4,2,4,2,4,6,4,6,"i have visited a lot of hostels all over the world, and i guess i have never slept so bad in a hostel as in this one.     our room was located at the 11th avenue, and it felt like we were in some kind of open-air-disco all night. the music didn&#039;t stop until 2 or 3 am in the morning, and we couldn&#039;t close our window. it was also very warm in our room, and there was no airconditioning. there was no hostel-like-atmosphere in this place. it was just a hotel, with some poor, cheap rooms."
India,Male,18-24,9.4,10,10,10,8,10,8,10,a very good place to stay. located near downtown you have many attractions near by to see. the only negative will be the fans in each room. rooms are really hot in summer. i wish they had some fast fans. other than that it is a very good place to stay for the money which they charge.
USA,Female,41+,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,"i have traveled extensively and have stayed in many different types of hostels around the world.  i had no problem with the staff, the location seems a bit sketchy but was no problem, if you rent a car you will need to park in a pay lot two blocks from the hostel - no big deal and is only $5.00/day.  i stayed in a women&#039;s 4 bed dorm with bathroom and hot shower. it is an old hotel that offers the basics, good for location. can be noisy from the outside traffic and or bars near."
England,Couple,18-24,5.4,8,4,8,6,2,2,8,"overall this hostel gave us its values worth. however we had a few issues with a member of staff being rude, unwilling to help and unable to perform tasks. i was looked at like a moron on the third time i repeated myself. the room (private) was bare, the window didn&#039;t close and the atmosphere was rather dull. for the rest of the facilities, it was a ghost town and pretty unnerving."
USA,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,8.6,10,10,10,6,10,4,10,very friendly and attentive staff. great location...easy access to public transit and minutes from 16st mall. not much chance to mingle with other travelers unless they&#039;re staying in your room. very clean overall. i will stay here again.
USA,Male,31-40,8,10,8,10,8,6,6,8,"i&#039;ve been to a few hostels around the world.  it seemed kind of sketchy at first because there were some weird people bugging the receptionist when i first got there.  like they all didn&#039;t seem like they were all there in the head.  be patient if the receptionist seems rude, he&#039;s actually nice i find.  i got a upgrade, no extra charge for some reason.  my mattress was bad and the blanket was made for a 5 year old.  the place looked tore up at first but it&#039;s actually clean.  location is perfect!"
Peru,Male,31-40,7.4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,"i am fortunate to have the bathrooms relatively in decent shape and not have them as dirty as other places elsewhere - the showers and bathrooms.  i liked the location because it is close to downtown and the bus routes to 30th and downing, which takes me to the airport.  the only reservation was that it is located to a couple of night clubs where the music was loud but by 2-3 am, the noise would dwindle. overall, i cannot complain that it is  a relatively respectable place to lodge."
Hungary,Couple,31-40,5.1,6,4,8,4,6,2,6,"a pretty rundown place, at an average location and not particularly cheap either. we only made some basic contact with the staff ( half sentences ) they were ok. the city itself makes up for everything though, denver is fantastic, if you booking late or for any other reason you get nowhere else to stay, the place will do for a couple of nights. "
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,10,8,8,8,6,10,the staff was helpful and professional.  the location was convenient as the hostel is a 10 min walk from the 16th st mall free shuttle.  there&#039;s a solid breakfast joint in the nearby capitol hill neighborhood named jelly. housekeeping does a good job of keeping the hostel clean.
USA,AllFemaleGroup,25-30,2.9,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,very misleading and very unfriendly staff. i would never recommend anyone ever stay here.
SouthAfrica,Female,31-40,5.7,6,6,2,6,8,4,8,"i came down me day to find the owner shouting at a client in the lobby. a very unpleasant experience. in addition, on the friday and saturday nights there were fights in the road outside the bar/ restaurant across the road. while i felt safe inside the hostel, i didn&#039;t always feel safe going outta night."
Argentina,Female,31-40,6.9,6,8,8,6,8,4,8,fine to stay a couple of nights. location is good as the cleanliness but the rooms can be depressing.
USA,Male,31-40,9.1,10,10,10,8,10,8,8,"several of us saw the bad reviews + it&#039;s just not true. i was there for 4 days/3 nites. centrally located, right downtown, a few blox from everything. it is loud when bars close, but pretty dead until morning traffic. it is 110 years old + a former 3-star euro style hotel. on the same floors it has 4-8 bunks (w/alcoves) and single occupancy rooms. common area is nice, lacks in furniture though. the next to each other shower/sink + separate bathroom was charming. no elevator but wide stairwells."
England,Male,18-24,7.7,10,6,10,6,8,4,10,"if you&#039;re looking to stay in central denver for a decent price, then this really is the best option. it&#039;s a perfectly fine hostel and is great for a couple of nights, but don&#039;t be expecting anything amazing. the building itself is actually maintained to a very high standard as it used to be a hotel, it&#039;s certainly one of the cleanest hostels i&#039;ve seen. the only negative is that there seems to be a lot of &#039;permanent residents&#039; and not as many young travellers as you might normally expect."
USA,Male,25-30,7.1,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,this not the best hostel in the world but it is the best in denver.
England,Male,31-40,6.6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,"i see what people are saying about this hostel, it does have a strange feel to it. still it&#039;s in a good enough place and i didn&#039;t really stay long enough to hate it. give it a go, book for  a few night, if that don&#039;t work, spend a little more and try using air bnb"
Canada,Female,25-30,6.9,8,6,6,8,8,4,8,"nice hostel, very close to the main st downtown, but in a not so nice area. it seemed to be filled with longterm locals/homeless."
Wales,Female,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,6,10,4,8,"staff were excellent, really friendly approachable and helpful - have stayed on a lot of hostels and they are some of the best."
USA,Male,25-30,8,10,6,10,8,8,6,8,"great location to downtown and great price, which is what i was going for. had a mix up with the lockers and someone else got mine. wifi also didn&#039;t work as expected, but there&#039;s a great coffee shop around the corner."
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,thanks to the hospitality and reasonable rates at  aae 11th avenue hostel was able to attend the &quot;becoming van gogh&quot; show at the denver art museum and check on job possibilites in the denver area.  the guy from alaska
Australia,Female,18-24,6.6,8,8,6,6,8,2,8,"i was only staying for a night and needed somewhere to crash.  the hostel was easy to find, and the walk wasn&#039;t difficult at all.  there had been a double booking so i was upgraded to a single, private room over the dorm i had booked.  for what i paid and for what i needed this hostel was perfect.  not much of an atmosphere though and breakfast wasn&#039;t provided in the morning. the room was clean and well looked after and the staff friendly and happy to help."
Macedonia,Male,18-24,4.6,4,6,8,4,4,2,4,"didn&#039;t feel very safe. there were few sketchy people while i stayed there. room too hot and not enough clean air. stayed at a similar hostel for same price but got tv, fridge and our own bathroom."
Australia,Male,18-24,6.9,6,10,10,6,6,2,8,"it was a nice hostel in a good location, however there was little to no atmosphere and i think i&#039;d have been quite bored had i stayed there on my own for much longer. the address listed was also very confusing, all it needed to say it was on the corner of 11th and broadway, i missed the place a few times in when i was arriving, as the big sign out front says hotel and in tiny writing hostel."
Malaysia,Male,18-24,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,8,8,"it is a good place to stay if you want cheap and near to downtown. someone slept at my bed and i have to take another bed, else everything is good"
Netherlands,Male,31-40,7.1,8,8,6,8,6,6,8,"nice place to stay. clean room, big room. i read a few reviews complaining about the noise from the street. that&#039;s kinda true, but i don&#039;t mind a little buzz. place looks cool and genuine. the building is over 100 years old, i heard, so nothing fancy like an elevator. still, very good value for your money."
Egypt,Female,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"the location of the hostel is the best! it is a few minutes away from the famous 16th street mall in downtown denver. in addition, for those who like to party, the hostel is very close to the best nightclubs and bars in denver like church, vinyl, and many others. they are all less than 1 minute away from the hostel. staying in a dorm in this hostel is very safe and secure, and the save no pains in maintaining the safety and the comfort of the guests. i would recommend this hostel to everybody!"
Australia,Male,18-24,6.6,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,"it&#039;s not really much of a hostel as they have quite a lot of permanent residents, mostly men in their 40&#039;s. there is a communal area which is available to only travellers and i did meet people there but on the whole there were not many travellers, and many of them kept to themselves. that said, i had a private room for $40p/n which was clean and well, comfortable and well kept. so if you want a fun hostel, maybe go somewhere else, but if you just need a comfortable room then its not bad."
Ireland,Female,31-40,7.1,6,8,8,6,8,6,8,"i was having trouble choosing a hostel in denver, having read several reviews here and on tripadvisor.  i chose this hostel in the end and wasn&#039;t disappointed. the staff are super friendly and helpful. i didn&#039;t really get to meet anyone else in my room as i was usually gone all day and using the hostel just to sleep. i found it strange that they assigned me a top bunk when there were bottom bunks available.  the bedroom ad kind of a separate lounge which was great (tv, fridge, sofa!)"
Australia,Male,41+,7.4,10,10,6,8,8,6,4,"it wasn&#039;t as close to amtrak or greyhound as the blurb made out, but there isn&#039;t anything else in this range as close.  i walked five blocks from civic centre bus terminal.  it provided everything which i wanted, with a bottleshop opposite, a convenience store in the building, and a mexican restaurant to one side.  my only reservation: just one sheet, and a doona which didn&#039;t seem to have a launderable cover.  the heating was such that i didn&#039;t use the doona."
NewZealand,Couple,31-40,6,8,6,8,4,8,2,6,"if its location you&#039;re after, then this hostel isn&#039;t bad - just 10-15min walk from the heart of denver. and the price was fairly reasonable. however, our room (on the main road) was so noisy and light (the curtain didn&#039;t cover the window) than even ear plugs and an eye mask didn&#039;t do the trick. i&#039;m sure the rooms at the back would be better. there was a really weird vibe - the whole place felt strange with no character. we are very resillient travellers and it takes a lot for us to not recommend"
Canada,Male,25-30,4,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,"this has to be the worst hostel i&#039;ve ever stayed at. there is no character, weird people and no facilities. i would never come here again. not only that, but, i would almost say that i had a better time in a hotel meeting people because you meet no one here."
Australia,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6,6,6,6,4,8,4,8,for the only hostel option in denver it was liveable but a not social place. kitchen was nothing more than a microwave and toaster oven. kitchen and common room were one.
Portugal,Female,18-24,5.7,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,"it&#039;s not a bad hostel, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s not that clean, and it used to be just a hotel and now it has a few dorms and common areas so it&#039;s not like other hostels if you know what i mean. the staff was nice i even was allowed to check-in at 8.30am and that was great since i had just come from an overnight bus. well, it&#039;s okay for one or two nights"
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,6,8,8,4,8,4,6,"thus was an average hostel at best. beds were uncomfortable, kitchen was nothing more than a toaster and microwave (bring your own spoon and fork as they have none), common room and kitchen was one room with not much space, internet stopped working every night."
Canada,Female,18-24,5.7,8,4,8,4,8,4,4,"they were renovating the first floor the night i stayed there, which was very inconvenient. also, there was not an other young traveler in my dormitory or in the common room when i was there... not quite a youth hostel like i expected."
USA,Female,41+,8.9,10,8,8,8,10,8,10,"very large female dorm room w/ private bathroom.  however, it was located on street side of building, w/ very poorly sealed windows so only complaint is hearing street noise from traffic on busy street"
USA,Male,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"mike and jim run a tight ship, always making improvements to the hostel.  during my stay, new tile was being put down in the lobby.  mark, at the front desk, was extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable of the surrounding area.  the heat worked great, and blankets were available.  this place is immaculate, and jim&#039;s staff is constantly cleaning everything.  i would have no reservations about staying here again.  please ignore all those other folks who have written negative reviews."
Philippines,Female,41+,8.6,8,10,10,6,10,8,8,.stove and cooking utensils..
USA,Male,18-24,7.4,6,8,10,8,8,6,6,"stayed for two nights at the beginning of october. suited my friend and me just fine. excellent location; within easy walking distance of 16th st. mall, the state capitol, and public transportation. was a little frustrated to pay for the full room as though i hadn&#039;t already paid a reservation fee to hostelworld. we were instructed to call and book with them directly next time. it was just a few dollars so i didn&#039;t argue about it. otherwise, good experience."
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10,10,10,6,10,6,10,"had a very good experience here, the hostel  is in a good location close to the civic centre and on a busy enough road to be safe. i did by really feel that safe in denver in general there were lots of beggars. i would advise anyone staying in hostels in the us to book single rooms as there are often undesirables in the dorm rooms"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,6,10,8,8,8,8,i thought this hostel was great for the price and location.  with in easy walking distance of 16th street which was nice.  only complaint was that there is a concert venue close by so on thursday and friday night it was noisy until until the concert was over.  i just popped in a pair of ear plugs and was fine but it is something to consider if you are a light sleeper.
USA,Male,41+,8.6,10,6,10,8,8,8,10,better than the other hostel listed on hostelworld. the place is fine for low noise during the week. watch out for the weekends. good eats nearby and cheap. helpful staff.
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10,10,10,8,8,6,10,"only complaint was that it got a bit loud due to traffic and the beds were really creaky. but very good location in downtown and friendly staff, and great value"
Australia,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,"great place if you are just after a comfortable bed and clean facilities, all a little dated but what can you expect? being about a 10 minute walk to all the action was handy. surrounded by bars and clubs didn&#039;t bother me but to some people that maybe an issue. the staff were pleasant but everyone in the hostel tended to keep to themselves there. great sports bar behind the place too!"
Canada,Male,41+,6.9,6,8,8,4,8,6,8,"it was a clean place but rooms have no air-conditioning, so it is rather bad in a hot weather."
Canada,Female,31-40,7.1,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,within walking distance to the main sights! towels are included which is great while your traveling!
Wales,Female,25-30,3.7,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,when i arrived there were several homeless people milling around outside. they&#039;re having work done so there was no door and sometimes no one on reception. i felt like it was more of a hostel for people who were staying there long term than a youth hostel and i would never stay there again.
Australia,Male,41+,9.7,10,10,10,10,10,8,10,"this hostel met with all my needs. the staff were good natured and very helpful. the location gave me access to the city , good food and entertainment. it also gave me access to the mountains and surrounding areas. all the facilities worked well and i enjoyed my stay. the price of accommodation was better than just good value. for a traveller it was just what the doctor ordered."
China,Male,31-40,8.6,8,10,8,8,8,8,10,"the a/c facilities need to be upgraded. the current wind fans in the hallways are deafening. luckily i brought my ear plugs with me. otherwise, it would have been a nightmare, especially because there was one right next to my door. plus, one of the showers on the second floor didn&#039;t have hot water, which wasn&#039;t a big deal for me but was it for some other guests. otherwise, it&#039;s really worth the money. the lobby, btw, is unpleasant currently. hope you could renovate it and make it western."
Russia,Female,18-24,8.9,10,8,6,10,8,10,10,"i really like this hostel, the location is pretty good, chose this hostel, if it is possible for you to walk around 15 mins to the downtown denver:)))"
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was perfect for what i needed.  friendly, knowledgeable staff, and clean facilities."
USA,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,not much character - and the neighboring bars can make it hard to sleep on weekend nights - but the location is convenient (a few blocks from the capitol building and denver art museum) and the price is right.
USA,Male,,7.4,8,8,10,6,8,6,6,"really, really hot. they had fans in the hallway but not in the room. otherwise a good deal, clean and secure. the lounge was very nice."
USA,Female,25-30,8.9,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,nice one and clean.  affordable
Germany,Female,31-40,6.3,8,6,8,6,6,4,6,the receiption looks rather unprofessional and the bunk beds are small and unstable. it was also quite load due to the noise from the street and the ac. it is an ok place to stay for a night.
Russia,Male,31-40,7.7,8,8,10,6,8,6,8,"location is great, but very noisy because couple of clubs across the street. as mentioned in one of the comments - bring the ear plugs. no a/c, huge ventilator makes a lot of noise. got private room with shared bathroom, no questions about it. good value for money, just don&#039;t forget about noise."
Japan,Male,41+,6,6,6,4,4,10,6,6,"the place was bit distanced from gray hound bus station and very noisy because there was no air condition so that window have to be kept open all night long. no cooking facility except microwave oven.   there is gentleman his name was mark h., he was very cautious and very helpful and kind also he has pride for his work and i was very inpressed for his proffesionalisem. thank you mark."
Australia,Female,18-24,6.9,8,8,6,8,6,4,8,"you should definitely take &#039;amtrak&#039; out of your title description, and  give much clearer instructions as to where you are located in relation to the station. ie. a bus ride and 20 mins walk away.   also, don&#039;t advertise a flaming pick-up from the station if you don&#039;t offer it!  otherwise, i was very happy with the female dorm room and the ensuite bathroom.   not a super nice location, especially after dark, but the building felt secure at least."
USA,Female,18-24,6,8,6,8,6,6,4,4,"it seemed kinda sketchy. big, old building with lots of middle aged guys on staff and in residence. not comfortable for a single woman traveler. the dorm rooms were nice and it was convenient having a bathroom in the shared room."
Germany,Male,18-24,6,6,8,6,4,6,4,8,"all in all the hostel was ok. the moste important things have been there. it was clean and safe which is one of the most important things for me and also the internet was better than in the most other hostels. but still for that price you can get a breakfast, free walking tours or a real kitchen in other hostels.  it is not the best hostel i ever stood but also not the worst. so nothing really to complain about. thank you."
NewZealand,Male,25-30,6.9,8,10,6,8,6,2,8,"needed air con, the rooms were hotter than satan&#039;s extra hot hot wings"
Netherlands,Female,31-40,6,6,6,8,4,8,4,6,"it was unbearably hot in the room and the street noise just came straight through my earplugs, so for the first time of my life i requested another room. eventually i could change to another (shady) room at the back of the hostel, which had a little fan and was less noisy."
Canada,Female,31-40,6.6,4,6,6,8,8,6,8,"i reserve for a private room and next to my window (other side if the road) they have an bar, it was really noisy until 2 am.  the temperature inside the room was very high.  they don&#039;t have ou find a fan for me and it was impossible to open my door.  finally, i didn&#039;t sleep much."
USA,Male,41+,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,8,10,"at time of website booking, i noted a stated availability of a shuttle to amtrak terminal. upon arrival, staff indicated that they did not know how that statement was attached to the location description, but no shuttle was available.  this should be corrected byco those responsible for website maintenance.  fortunately for me, hostel staff explained available 16th ave free bus and it turned out to be entirely satisfactory.  i was very impressed by the courtesy and assistance of all staff."
USA,Male,41+,4.9,4,6,6,4,6,4,4,"i got a good night&#039;s sleep because i was dead tired.  temperatures were in the 90&#039;s, fans moved air in the hall ways, but the open window to the alley was not enough to bring down the temperature in the room.  my dorm room was occupied when i arrived, so they placed me in a private room, at full cost.  it all worked out.  i&#039;d go again."
USA,Male,18-24,8.9,10,8,10,8,8,8,10,"great value!  the common area is very nice.  it was a little tough in the dorms without ac during the summer, but overall a great experience."
France,Male,25-30,3.4,2,4,8,4,2,2,2,"the description on this website is partially wrong: they have no parking and no restaurant.  when i complained (politely) about it, the behavior of the manager was not right (&quot;you ask for a parking because it is written on the web-site; it is also written that we have a restaurant, so what, am i suppose to pay for your diner... i cannot control the information on those web-sites&quot;).  the toilet sit was not clean...  the bath-tub had to shower head..."
Canada,Female,18-24,7.7,10,8,8,4,8,8,8,"this place will surprise you! super great value for the &quot;dorm&quot; like rooms on the 3rd floor, with a private washroom in the room with us. only complaint is that it was like an inferno during june without a/c. we couldn&#039;t catch a breeze with the windows open; i melted into my bed. being on broadway was a loud but entertaining experience - you eventually get to sleep, but beware of very early morning traffic. also, there wasn&#039;t a full kitchen available. staff was an older group but all friendly!"
USA,Female,18-24,3.1,6,2,4,2,4,2,2,lots of bums outside of the hostel.
Canada,Female,25-30,6.3,6,6,6,6,8,4,8,"there aren&#039;t a lot of budget accommodations in denver. this hostel is pretty basic. it&#039;s a hotel and a hostel. it&#039;s just a few blocks from downtown, but gets a little scuzzy at night (lots of yelling drunks, and fighting breaking out). it was also really noisy. the common hostel room was nice, but there weren&#039;t really any dishes so cooking something was impossible. the hostel is old and rough around the edges. it was ok for a couple nights, but i wouldn&#039;t want to stay any longer than that."
USA,Female,18-24,9.1,10,10,8,10,10,8,8,friendly staff and good location
Ireland,Male,18-24,4.6,4,2,8,4,4,4,6,"major security issues here - the guy at reception couldn&#039;t show me to my room because he had to stay in reception to stop random people gaining access to the building. non-guests were coming and going, constantly using the payphone in reception and he was the only thing stopping them coming upstairs. location is good."
Russia,Female,31-40,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"my luggage was lost at the airport and in hostel i was given  all necessary things like a towel, shampoo..., thank you so much! the excellent personnel, a cosy, clean room."
USA,Male,25-30,7.7,10,6,10,6,8,6,8,"it is more of a cheap hotel than a hostel, but the bunk rooms were clean, and the staff and lodgers were friendly. my only gripe is the lack of a full kitchen."
France,Female,18-24,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"nice suite with private tv, bathroom, fridge, microwave oven, very charming and convenient. lots of space to store suitcases in the room. very friendly staff. basic groceries around the corner."
England,Male,25-30,5.7,8,6,8,6,6,2,4,very mediocre hostel. no atmosphere at all! was more like a cheap hotel than a hostel. a very cheap hotel!
Australia,Male,31-40,8.3,8,8,8,8,10,8,8,"all staff do a great job to make you feel very welcome. mark was great when checking in and showing me around - thanks mark!  the rooms were always cleaned promptly and thoroughly, including the bathrooms and toilets.  the hostel is in a good location and i&#039;d definitely recommend the place to other travelers.  the renovation work currently underway doesn&#039;t distract from the atmosphere of the place. even the builders were very helpful!"
USA,Female,18-24,8.3,10,10,8,8,6,8,8,"the hallway smelled like cigarettes, but everything was very clean. nice that there was a bathroom, couch, and tv within the room! free use of a locker was very helpful. there were two other girls about my age in the room, so i felt comfortable there. the entire hostel does not have that &quot;community hostel feel&quot; (some people actually stay there for longer periods of time, if i understand correctly), but it was a good place to spend the night. overall i was very impressed for the price."
Brazil,Couple,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,10,6,8,"in fact it&#039;s a hotel with a common room, but the staff is nice and helpful, and it was good located for what i needed. i would definitely stay there again."
England,Female,18-24,7.7,8,8,10,6,10,4,8,"irs a hostel and a hotel which is a bit of a wierd set up not social at all unless ur lucky enough to get someone really nice in my room, which i did, awsome location like a few blocks from 5th (shopping strip) staff that i spoke to were absoloutly lovely more then happy to help, its clean and safe also x"
England,Male,41+,8,6,8,10,6,10,8,8,"location great for downtown, but was a bit dingy"
USA,Female,25-30,6,8,4,6,8,6,4,6,this was more like an extended stay than a hostel.
England,Male,25-30,7.4,8,8,10,6,6,6,8,"i wouldn&#039;t go as far as to call it a hostel, because although it&#039;s got dormitory rooms it doesn&#039;t have a backpacker community feel. great location for exploring downtown and very secure. there wasn&#039;t a door to my dorm, so it got cold at night. and i&#039;d take a shower upstairs rather than in the communal washroom...unless you want to shower while someones abluting first thing. all that said, it was a good place to stay for exploring the city for a couple of days and i&#039;d probably stay again."
USA,Male,31-40,8.9,10,8,10,10,8,6,10,"this hostel seems to double as an single-room-occupancy (sro) hotel, a type of housing that often caters to the poor and housing unstable. still, the facilities were clean, quiet, safe and secure.  the arrangement seems to make the atmosphere less social than other hostels i&#039;ve stayed in, but this can be a good thing.  the staff was helpful and i enjoyed my stay.  the proximity to downtown is awesome."
England,Female,18-24,4,2,4,8,2,6,4,2,came across cockroach&#039;s on more than one occassion!!  no facilities for us to do any cooking.
Brazil,Male,25-30,5.1,6,4,8,4,8,2,4,is this a hostel?  common room with password.
Germany,Male,25-30,6,6,6,8,4,8,4,6,to stay for one or two nights it is okay. the mattresses are too thin you feel any springs and some bugs in the bathroom. but the staff is very helpful.
USA,Female,25-30,8.6,10,8,10,8,8,6,10,"we had a separated bath and another separate sink in our suite, which i highly applaud -- this allows other people to use the sink when the bath/toilet is occupied.  only other thing to make it more perfect is if there is a draw-door or some little separation between the sleeping area and the common area in the room.  this would allow partition of a quiet/sleeping space, and a hangout space where you don&#039;t need to feel as restricted."
USA,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"in the process of renovating so it&#039;s only getting better. not a traveler hostel, more of a hotel atmosphere so if you want privacy, this is the place with a great location."
Scotland,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,slightly dated decor but very comfortable. undergoing renovations but that&#039;s what you expect in the winter! staff very friendly and helpful
England,Female,18-24,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i was surprised, the hostel is well clean, spacious, great location. only 5 mins walk from the free shuttle bus and main areas of interest. the dorms are like apartments with fridge, tv, microwave and a mini kitchen/common room. the staff are above and beyond helpful and friendly. i really enjoyed my stay here."
Germany,Male,18-24,4.7,0,4,8,0,6,2,6,"this is not really a hostel. it is more like a hotel which want to earn some easy extra money by hosteling. i was in a 8 bed room, which was only temporary. the beds were totally uncomfortable with a thin mattress. i slept only few hours per night. the &quot;common&quot; looks new, but no stove to cook something, only microwaves. the staff was friendly an make my bed changes possible, after i got a broken bed. all in all i won´t stay there again, also there many creepy people in and around the hostel."
France,Male,18-24,7.1,6,8,6,6,10,6,8,"this place is ok. the staff is really nice, but the facilities are very average and the bedding is the worst kind. the location is quite good though."
USA,Male,18-24,5.1,4,6,10,4,6,4,2,"the hotel is very old and in really rough shape.  nevertheless, we at least expected clean water.  note that the rooms with a &quot;private bathroom&quot; don&#039;t have a shower - just a tub.  when we turned the water on, about half a gallon of disgusting, black, foul-smelling water came out of the tub faucet until it turned clear.  it looked and smelled like raw sewage.  while the location is good, it doesn&#039;t justify staying in a dump when a nice hotel in the same area costs $10 more."
Australia,Male,25-30,7.3,0,8,8,0,10,6,6,room was really big with wifi in the room and pay tv. also the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and were happy to help with everything we needed. most of the people staying in the hostel didn&#039;t appear to travellers and were locals who appeared to be living there so it didn&#039;t have the atmosphere of some other hostels around. the bathroom could have also been a little bit cleaner but apart from that it was good.
Japan,Female,31-40,9,0,10,10,0,10,6,8,"i&#039;ve been traveling to all over the countries. i found this hostel was overall great. i was here for just 1 night to go boulder. i booked dorm (6 people), and i was only one. the room has own bathroom, shower, tv, and microwave. it was very clean, and staff were very helpful. if i have a chance to come back, i would stay here, for sure."
Finland,Female,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,"bring earplugs! the hostel is surrounded by pubs and clubs. so if you want to get any sleep, bring earplugs!"
China,Male,18-24,8.3,0,8,10,0,10,8,8,"the ventilating situation in male&#039;s dorm is not good, with being told by the staff that dorms are going to move upstairs. anyway, it&#039;s really has a nice location and good price."
USA,Male,25-30,4,0,4,8,0,6,2,2,this seemed more like a half way house than a hostel.  i would not recommend this place to anyone.  i did not feel comfortable hanging out in the &quot;hostel&quot; and the place itself was not conducive to lounging anyway.
USA,Male,41+,9,0,8,10,0,8,10,8,"very reasonable price, super location, clean, friendly and helpful staff, old timey atmosphere- it&#039;s hard to imagine a better place to stay in a great city like denver!"
England,Female,18-24,9,0,10,10,0,10,8,10,"i&#039;ve stayed here twice now and have really enjoyed it both times. staff are really friendly and helpful, the place is very clean. free internet and wifi, tv and sofas in the dorm rooms. despite other&#039;s reviews i&#039;ve always met some really fun people in this hostel too. would definitely recommend it :)"
England,Male,18-24,8,0,6,10,0,8,8,8,pretty okay for a hostel and in a handy location if you want to see the major sites of denver. a fun bar around the corner too (although you do hear the noise from it).
China,Male,18-24,6.7,0,4,8,0,10,6,6,"i lived in room 210(private ensuit) which is facing the street.  so it was very noisy especially during the weekends.  the room was alright and the location is good.   the only satisfied thing for my staying was the friendly staff.  overall, i don&#039;t think i would pay the same price to live there again"
England,MixedGroup,25-30,6.7,0,6,8,0,6,4,8,"i was really surprised by how much i liked this place. the single room i had was very clean and comfortable and more like a basic hotel. however,  the bathroom was very dated (but still very clean). i had three issues; firstly, the my room was at the front of the hostel facing the main road, so at night was really really noisy. secondly, the my room was incredibly warm which made it quite difficult to sleep. and finally, some of the other guests staying there were a little strange!"
England,Female,31-40,7.3,0,8,8,0,10,4,8,"enjoyed my stay. my room was clean and large, with free wifi.  the hotel is 15 min walk from downtown, which is quite good. it&#039;s definitely value for money. staff are super friendly and helpful.  the only down side was it gets a bit noisy around 6 am and there is no air con."
England,MixedGroup,41+,5,0,6,6,0,8,2,4,"no aircon or fan in room. we had to have window open and was above a very smelly fried food restaurant. bath was rusty. we expected more of a youth hostel, but seemed more of a hostel for down and outs. no shower. cockroach spotted in reception. towel was $3 dollar deposit but was stained with a big hole. on a positive note, the staff were very friendly. would not stay again or recommend it."
Australia,Female,18-24,6,0,8,8,0,6,2,6,"this place all depends on your own standards and tolerance, i stayed in a private room it had its own toilet and bath (but no shower, which makes washing your hair a small challenge) and its own tv the bed was kinda comfy but my room faced an alleyway which seemed to be a parking lot for the people going out so it can get a bit noisey but overall for the price i paid for my own room i thought this place was pretty good."
Netherlands,Male,25-30,9,0,8,10,0,10,8,10,we arrived at night when the neighboorhood was a little bit iffy. other than that we had a great experience.
Australia,Female,18-24,9.7,0,10,10,0,10,10,10,i arrived at 2am and staff were very welcoming and helpful! and helped me the next morning- temporary amtrak station is right beside union station!
Australia,Male,25-30,6.3,0,8,8,0,8,4,4,the toilet in the main bathroom had no stall around it!! i was shaving when a man came in a started pooing infront of me... i felt horribly sick. this must be against health regulations.
Canada,Female,31-40,7.3,0,6,6,0,8,8,8,"do not come here with a car!! the website says &quot;street parking&quot; but that&#039;s misleading. you can&#039;t park behind the hostel and if you park on the streets you will get a ticket, regardless of which state your license plates are from; this is due to colorado having unconstitutional laws regarding their treatment of other states&#039; cars. in fact don&#039;t come to denver with a car for that same reason.you can park in a lot down the street but the minute you move the car to load it or unload it, out come the"
Canada,Male,18-24,6.3,0,8,8,0,8,4,8,"this hostel is a good cheap alternative to a hotel. the one thing that i love about hostels is the interaction between the travelers, but in denver, it really was absent. that&#039;s my only complaint."
USA,Male,25-30,7,0,10,10,0,6,4,6,"the hostel is in a great location and clean enough for what you would expect from a hostel.  there are some shady looking people that stay in some of the rooms there (and hang out front and back of the hostel), but they are actually very nice.  there is no bar and no mixed male/female option for rooms which i was not used to.  i did not like the fact that they assign your bed and will not let you change it.  at one point there was only two people in the room and i still had to stay on a top bunk"
England,Male,31-40,7.3,0,8,6,0,10,4,8,"the staff were lovely, the room was big and the bed comfy - it was roughly under 10 mins walk to the main shopping centre of denver and all the cafés and restaurants. however, there is a convenience shop to one side of the hostel/hotel and a fast food place on the other side. i would have liked the room a little warmer - but i got used to it. the bathroom didn&#039;t have a shower. but the bath was clean and the water was very hot."
Australia,Female,25-30,7.7,0,8,10,0,10,4,8,"great location - was able to get from the airport to the hostel on two buses ($11) at 11pm at night &amp; arrived right across street. could walk to major bus stations, 16th st mall, restaurants, supermarkets. staff were very friendly and informative. like all the hostels i have stayed at in denver, most of the other guests appeared to be locals. dorm room was very clean &amp; spacious, bathroom in room was super clean as well. the room also had a tv, table and couch in it."
Italy,Male,25-30,2.7,0,2,6,0,2,2,2,i dont recommend it at all!!
USA,Male,18-24,6.3,0,8,6,0,6,4,8,"this is not what most backpackers have in mind when they envision a hostel.  the property is essentially a budget hotel with only one eight-bed dorm that is separated from the hotel by a parking lot.  there is little opportunity to meet people outside of your room, and the location is a 15-20 minute walk from the city center.  not a bad part of town, but not the best, either.  there aren&#039;t many hostels in denver, and i would stay here again.  the security lockers in the dorm are good."
France,Male,25-30,3.7,0,4,8,0,4,2,2,"really too much noise coming from the street. there was even not a shower in the &quot;private bathroom&quot;, just a bathtub which could not be filled !"
Australia,Male,18-24,5.3,0,6,8,0,6,2,8,"this is only just a hostel.  as others have said it appears to be just a flop house for down-and-outers, with a dorm room tacked on the back.  price wise it isnt bad i guess, but theres no kitchen, horribly uncomfy beds, no computers  no common area - unless you count the outside area that&#039;s full of questionable characters who appear under the effects of one or other substances.  &quot;we get alot of street people coming through here so make sure you keep your door locked&quot; - staff member   forget it!"
Germany,Male,41+,6,0,8,6,0,10,6,4,"the washbasin looks like before world war,    the toilet was faulty.    the staff was very fantastic  to organize me a taxi in the morning, 5 a.m."
USA,Male,18-24,8,0,6,10,0,10,10,4,"i have low standards, but there was no hot water in the showers, and our sheets had not been changed when we arrived. so we slept on sheets and pillows with hair, bugs, brushing off small crumbs all night. cigarette holes are ok with me, but not a stranger&#039;s short and curlies. roaches had a field day in my room. this is standard for $10 in mexico, but not for $55 per room in the usa. but it&#039;s a great, convenient neighborhood, not dangerous at all. loved the pawn shop downstairs."
Germany,Male,18-24,5.7,0,6,8,0,6,4,4,"it was alright, but by far not great. the showers were in one room with three toilets and two sinks, nothing there to cover anything except for the shower curtains.  no breakfast included.  location is pretty good though, about 5-8 walking minutes away from the state capitol, right on broadway. but that means it gets pretty loud till late at night. take earplugs!"
Australia,Female,18-24,6.7,0,6,6,0,6,6,8,"i stayed in a private room. i didn&#039;t opt for an ensuite, but the room did have a sink in it, which was useful. it was much cleaner and larger than i expected.  the downside was that all rooms are upstairs but there is no lift, and i don&#039;t think the staff had any intention of helping me with my bags, but luckily for me, someone else staying there helped me carry them upstairs.  the bathrooms were always very clean.  it wasn&#039;t perfect, but it was comfortable, and i&#039;d probably stay again if i had to"
USA,Female,31-40,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,"the property was fine... i booked this location over a month in advance, and when i got there i had no reservation. as it was new year’s eve, it was extremely inconvenient, and very difficult and expensive to find a new hotel so last minute. i was very upset, as i’ve used hostelworld many times before, and it’s been great "
Switzerland,Couple,31-40,4.3,4,4,6,4,6,4,2,"this hotel needs to be updated like asap, breakfast its terrible not good at all!!!!!!"
USA,Female,25-30,6.9,4,10,10,4,10,6,4,the staff and shuttle were awesome! the pool area was clean but didn&#039;t have towels. the cleanliness of the rooms were not the best.  pillowcases were inside out and not quite sure if the sheets were changed. the hallways were really old looking and need to be updated.  probably would not stay there again.  
USA,Female,18-24,7.4,6,2,10,6,10,10,8,this site is scam and a lie by the hotel was awesome!!!
USA,Male,25-30,3.7,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,misleading pictures. pictures don&#039;t tell you that this place is an old beaten down hotel. absolutely not worth the money that is being charged. i&#039;d rather pay $50 a night for a motel. 
USA,Male,41+,7.7,10,10,6,6,10,6,6,"it&#039;s a step above a hostel.  the room was ok.  the hallway run was stained, but the bed was clean and the tv worked.  the hot water was hot, which was a good thing.   depending on what you want to do at night, the the neighborhood is either great or sketchy."
USA,Couple,41+,6,4,6,6,4,10,6,6,possibly the worst breakfast buffet ever... really needs new carpeting.. looks and smells old.  staff very nice and helpful.  
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6,8,6,4,8,8,4,4,"decent place. maids aren&#039;t very nice. front desk is friendly though. the male staff at the bar/restaurant were friendly too. continental breakfast wasn&#039;t all that great, but it was free, and you really can&#039;t ask for more. this was our second trip to denver and our second year staying at the ramada.. i&#039;d come back for a third year next year; for the price it&#039;s worth it."
USA,Female,31-40,4,2,2,10,4,2,4,4,they didn&#039;t let me stay there. can i please have my money refunded?  i&#039;ll join again if so.
Canada,Male,25-30,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"i don&#039;t see how much better a hotel service can get...the staff was so accommodating, the shuttle bus was so helpful...not sure how i would have gotten around denver...they refer you to great private drivers to airports...such a convenient location..great, great food places around. i highly recommend this place. thank you for making my trip so memorable!"
USA,Female,41+,4.9,4,4,10,4,6,4,2,"we are so saddened that it was not up to parr as it is very close to where my son lives and downtown denver,the halls just plain stunk the sheets did not seem clean, and the elevator stunk had no ac, iand broke soon after we arrived. not to mention that the jars of ice water and lemon in the front were left out for over 24 hours and not replentished: icemaker broke, the fruit rotted in there for over 24 hours."
Australia,Male,18-24,5.7,8,8,6,4,6,2,6,"good luggage storage and security.   friendly staff which always made us feel welcome.   however, would be beneficial to visitors if there was a bench for the gym (as advertised in the photo)  inappropriate scent in majority of hotel, please attend to this."
USA,Female,25-30,9.1,10,8,10,8,10,10,8,staff was very helpful and pleasant. the location was awesome for the price. i would stay here again. there are a lot of places to eat and go out that are walking distance. 
USA,Male,41+,8.6,8,8,10,8,10,8,8,still working a double billing issue.
USA,Female,41+,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,"it was a graduation weekend for us, and a bronco&#039;s weekend for the ramada, and everything went smoothly and comfortably.  jason at the desk was warm and welcoming and gave us his &quot;must see&quot; list for our first visit to denver - and he was so right-on!  we never fully anticipated how central and convenient the location would be.  my son, the denver resident, decided he will recommend it to all his visiting friends from out of town, and we definitely will be back!"
USA,Female,31-40,9.4,10,8,10,8,10,10,10,"i don&#039;t know what people were complaining about, this was a great place to stay, easy to get around...would totally stay here again!"
USA,Female,25-30,4.9,2,6,6,4,6,6,4,i checked in and my room was a mess.  i thought for a second maybe someone is still checked in? i looked around and didn&#039;t see any personal belongings. just a newspaper and a bed with sheets everywhere.  there was a maid and i let her know and she told me she get to it later. i asked if she could at least make the bed? so she did unhappily. i essentially booked a dirty room! oh yeah they are 42o friendly because the halls reeked. not my cup of tea as i was traveling with two teens.
Scotland,Female,25-30,5.1,4,6,2,6,8,6,4,not a great location. felt threatened by homeless beggars outside. was a non smoking room but  smelt of smoke and sweat.
USA,Female,31-40,7.1,8,8,6,6,8,6,8,good value for the money.
Canada,Female,25-30,5.4,4,8,4,8,6,2,6,"beware, this hostel will charge you taxes upon arrival, so the remaining balance will be higher than what you expect.  don&#039;t bother eating at their restaurant in the hotel, rather, cross the street to the irish pub for a better value for your money and a little more taste. i have had  little good  sleep  because the hotel walls are thin and there is a club playing music loud close by. if your neighbour has a loud voice, you will hear everything. some of the staff are helpful, not all of them."
USA,Couple,25-30,6.9,6,8,8,6,6,6,8,even a tiny complementary breakfast would have been nice considering the price.
USA,Female,25-30,7.7,10,6,8,8,10,8,4,"i definitely recommend staying here!  this place is a hotel, so it&#039;s an excellent value!!  my only reason for the &quot;poor&quot; cleanliness rating is the sticky carpet in our room... we wore our shoes, which stuck to the floor of the bathroom (after walking on the carpeting) like they sometimes do in movie theaters.  other than that, the place was clean and the staff were friendly and very helpful (they held my luggage for me behind the counter when i checked in early and even brought it to my room)."
Australia,Female,25-30,8.9,10,10,8,10,10,4,10,"be careful- there are two of these with really similar names!! but it was amazing value for money, it&#039;s a hotel/motel rather than a hostel, but well located and i had a gorgeous room. a really good option if you&#039;re on a budget but don&#039;t want to sleep in a flophouse!"

China,Female,18-24,8,8,8,8,8,10,6,8,"good bang for the buck spot, but the some of the people who stay there are kind of sketch. the hotel staff was very nice and helpful."
Serbia,MixedGroup,18-24,8.3,0,6,10,0,10,8,8,"the ramada is a good place to stay if you&#039;re traveling on a budget. it&#039;s located only 10 minutes walking from the state capitol. it also has a free shuttle from the hotel which you have to order an hour in advance.  the staff is really nice and helpful, they answered all of our questions.  as far as security goes, the hotel itself is very safe, however, the neighborhood is sketchy. a lot of crack whores and junkies walking around, but nothing happened to us. you just have to be extra cautious."
Brazil,Female,25-30,8,0,8,8,0,8,6,8,"great hotel, great price and good location. about the  staff, jason (during the night) was for sure the most helpfull one. during the morning we had some problems and some rude attendents, but nothing that could ruin our stay. about the shuttles: we could use it every day, but you have to make the reservation in advance. have a good restaurant and also a pub and a pizza place just in front of it. would recommend it for sure!"
