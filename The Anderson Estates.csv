Colombia,Male,18-24,8.9,10.0,8.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,"i love this hostal, the staff its very nice, i recommend it especially for young people. breakfast perfect. and they have a very nice dog. really i dont understand the bad reviews.    "
USA,Male,18-24,9.1,10.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"i had a good stay at the hostel. i met many friendly people and everybody was happy to be there, including the staff.  it has a centric location and is great if you don’t mind a 1 hour commute in transit to get to major destinations.   my one issue during my stay was that i was hit with a wooden board from the top bed that fell on my head."
USA,Male,18-24,7.1,6.0,10.0,10.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,"amazing people, location and food that they serve there daily. although i wasn’t informed about a bed bug situation that had been brought to their attention about my exact same bed one week prior to my visit. i woke up the next day with extreme bites all over my body. if you don’t want to be bitten, book another hostel. btw, if you even set your things down on the floor, they’re prone to carrying bugs. "
USA,Male,41+,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,very nice place. in a quiet neighborhood 
USA,Male,41+,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"thank you all! 2nd time at your location and i really y enjoyed both stays. i look forward to next year. always an adventure.   oh, and tyler, you rock!!! please send me any dates or info on carlos. i hope he does well in his upcoming pursuits!  sincerely, dan c"
Canada,Female,18-24,3.4,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,unfortunately my stay at the anderson estates was a lot worse than i had expected. i read previous reviews and had an idea of what i was getting myself into but i didn't expect to be treated as poorly as i was by the staff. they had assigned my bed to somebody else without informing me or assigning me to a new bed. i had nowhere to sleep my first night and the office was closed. when i went to resolve the issue the staff blamed it on me and did not apologize or feel bad at all. 
USA,Couple,18-24,6.6,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"pretty chill atmosphere, definitely a place for young people. we stayed in a private room and i thought they were joking at first but they gave us this ancient skeleton key for the door that was difficult to use. not a great location, the neighborhood isn't very sketchy its just far away from things if you don't have a car. we got tap cards but the metro wasn't great either. would have taken us over an hour to get to the beach or other places we wanted to go. "
Peru,Female,25-30,4.9,4.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,"you don't even get what you pay for. the communal kitchen was always dirty. the entire house smelled like urine and weed.  male workers came into female dorms without even knocking (it happen to all of us staying in the dorm, they came in when my roommate was getting dressed).  there are  no lockers, rooms don't have locks (everything is open, no keys), no curtains (not even in the restroom).  i've been to hostels around the world, i never thought the usa one would be so disappointing."
Colombia,Male,18-24,9.7,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"sit by the pool or deep in it; the staff is friendly, and unlike in many other places i stayed they actually want to be here doing what they do.    some guests are possible transplants to la others are just travelers, so you have the right balance. there is also an unwritten code of respect for personal space and privacy, so if you have to work or write that important email, there is the silence and space to do that.    metro is walking distance, and you can go directly to st monica or downtown! :)  "
Finland,Male,25-30,8.3,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,it's definitely a hostel worth checking out. friendly and helpful staff and the facilities are just something else. quite a fancy hostel i'd say. better than average breakfast and you even get served. nice pool area with a real possibility to sunbathe so if you're lazy enough or too tired you don't even have to hit the beach necessarily.  price is fair and it feels good to pay for the stay with these guys. the metro station is close by which really makes moving around very easy and convenient .
England,Male,31-40,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"clean hostel , near the subway, economical place and friendly staff"
Australia,Female,31-40,2.9,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,won't stay here again
England,Male,25-30,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"perfect place to be located, very easy to get everywhere &amp; such friendly staff. incredible value for money!! 10/10"
Germany,Female,25-30,6.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,"well, i guess you get what you pay for. unfortunately we were late due to my plane being delayed, so my friend and i were both charged with a  late check-in fee (although we had called before). this fee was stupid- all staff members actually live on the hostel ground and are up, partying all night anyway. the rooms were fine, the beds very comfortable. there were ants everywhere though. you can not lock your belongings. bathrooms were meeh, ok. my friend was put in the wrong room, too. "
NewZealand,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,"good place to stay, great atmosphere and only a short walk from metro transport"
Canada,AllFemaleGroup,18-24,7.4,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,"this place has a great vibe and is very close to la! walking distance to metro. overall a great experience!  i just want to give some tips just about minor things. the outside bathrooms were a bit dirty and not always stocked (toilet paper, no shelf in 1 bathroom). the sink is outside of the 2 bathrooms, and it was very small with no shelf to put your stuff, except for a brick ledge. the shared room we had didn't have a lock, which was a bit concerning. the kitchen was small and unorganized."
Australia,Female,18-24,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"the place was disgusting. there were ants all over my bed and next to my bed. no security what so ever. no locks on the doors or lockers to put belongings in. there weren't even blinds on all the windows so any one could look into my room which was severely cramped. toilets were dirty and hard to access. didn't end up staying a single night there, left as soon as i could. couldn't get a refund, staff were rude. book the hostel in santa monica instead and you'll have a lot more value for money. "
SouthKorea,Female,18-24,4.9,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,"there are a lot of ants, which irritated me. and few restrooms compared to the number of guests."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,great hostel- don't really get the bad reviews. staff are really nice and its great value for money. good breakfast with a lot of choice. great hostel. 
England,Female,25-30,2.6,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,bad things:  filthy  in a dodgy neighborhood  no locks on doors or secure places for passport  2.5km from nearest grocery store  literally four inches between beds and no side tables or benches for laying stuff out which meant people left stuff all over the floor  someone stole my scarf and all my food  one room had no privacy at all and was ground floor with no curtains on french window style doors        good things:  solid wifi  good breakfast  tv with some games consoles  pool    
USA,Male,18-24,9.4,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,"great place! free amenities! friendly staff and guests, perfect for traveling artists, musicians, and actors."
USA,Male,31-40,6.3,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,8.0,2.0,"staff are very nice and helpful. they clean quite a bit, but the facilities themselves are old and falling apart. showers were disgusting. one leaked constantly and flooded the bath. great location; 15 min walk from the train. no air conditioning can make sleeping difficult in the summer (it looked like some rooms had window units, but not mine). breakfast is pretty good. lots of mosquitoes by the pool. i got bit every night. overall weird vibe. no close stores/alcohol.  "
Australia,Male,25-30,8.9,10.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,6.0,i had a amazing time /stay 
Australia,Male,18-24,9.7,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"great atmosphere, having the pool as the social area, only 10 mins walk from the expo metro line. great value, the neighbourhood has many shops in walking distance."
Chile,Female,18-24,4.9,2.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,8.0,10.0,2.0,"normally staying at an hostel your expectations for cleanliness aren't that high but if you have to pay a $15 dollar fee per person for it you would hope that you would see where that money goes.to begin with their was lice in my bed, yes.every morning i would wake up with bites around my whole body, it wasn' until the my last day that i saw one moving around my sheets, the bathrooms are decent but the showers are disgusting, you can tell that no one has clean those showers with bleach in weeks."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.9,10.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,6.0,if you're staying in la and want to meet all kinds of beautiful people from around the world then this is the only place to stay. location was great and the mansion itself blew my mind. the pool is amazing and the staff are great. loved it!  
England,Male,25-30,7.4,10.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,6.0,"saw the reviews on this and was pleasantly surprised when i saw it. swimming pool, cool people, super cheap, breakfast was decent, area was a little dodgy but i walked around at night and lived to tell the tail so it's all good. i left my laptop in my room and didn't get stolen so nothing but good things to say about the place"
USA,AllMaleGroup,25-30,6.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,8.0,4.0,i was worried i had brought bedbugs back with me for about a month.. saw some beg bug spray left out in room and some people in my room were bit by something.. place was a mess nice staff.. wasn't horrible.. wasn't amazing.. had to walk a few blocks to get a free breakfast.. 
Mexico,Male,25-30,3.7,4.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,"if you are looking for the nastiest, most ghetto hostel in la, look no further, from sheets with blood, this 3rd world hostel will not disappoint you, come and stay at la's greatest show. from living rooms and other amenities rooms changed to bunk beds, to bathrooms barely accesible. prepare yourself for a thrilling experience of getting into a lottery of who's staying at the 'mansion' and who will be staying at some random unfinished house from a nearby area."
Canada,Male,25-30,9.1,10.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,"loved the security guard at the front of the street. very kind individual, everyone gave off great vibes.    get some locks!   was totally blown away that not only did the dorms not have locks, but there was no locker option. very unnerving to go to outl all day and have to cross fingers your belongings would be there/untampered with when returning at night.      luckily everyone was great and there were no issues,  with the amount of traffic coming through it only takes 1 bad seed to spoil it all."
Australia,Male,31-40,7.1,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,"it seems lots has been said both positive and negative about this place.  let's start with positive- some staff were very helpful and assisted when an issue arose. pool was inviting. cool old house other guests are good to hang with. breakfast is free and fills a hole. washing is free. the area while appears dodgy locals were really friendly, its safe and close to metro. security on main road too.  neg- some staff not friendly. too few  bathrooms, no locks on rooms."
Canada,Female,18-24,8.3,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,6.0,amazing place! loved staying here. everyone was extremely friendly and the vibe is rad. 
Singapore,MixedGroup,18-24,2.9,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,"the hostel was pictured and marketed far beyond its actual standards. the security was almost next to nothing, with no lockers and no way to lock our rooms. the fact that the toilets were only in some rooms and were 'shared' meant that people kept entering the rooms with toilets. the floor was so dirty, the towels were not washed properly. "
Russia,Female,25-30,9.1,10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,felt like home. exactly what needed after 12h flight. staff is very friendly and helpful. 
Germany,Female,18-24,5.4,6.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,2.0,hadi was really nice.. 
Netherlands,MixedGroup,18-24,8.6,10.0,6.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,"great place with awesome staff and guests, lovely (clean) pool. had a really great time here. not very close to downtown la or the beaches, but it is close to a metro train station though!"
England,Female,18-24,9.4,10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"my favourite place, honestly is a home away from home. the staff are incredibly friendly (special shout out to hadi who helped us order pizza) lovely atmosphere and great location, near to train station and and bus stops and local food supermarket close by. definitely will stay again "
Poland,MixedGroup,25-30,5.7,6.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,"there was no lock in rooms and even in the house.  we smelled a gas from the stove area.  we didn't feel safe.  it smelled like damp and the furnishing wasn't working properly (ie. windows, shower)."
England,Female,25-30,7.7,10.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,4.0,10.0,4.0,"door to room was unlocked all of the time.  had a problem with ants in the room and the member of staff we brought the issue up to told us it was our fault for having food in the room (there was no food in the room) anf got somebody to just sweep the ants out. other than that single issue, the hostel was amazing"
USA,Male,25-30,4.9,6.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,"poor management at this hostel, got placed in another property away from the main house and it's facilities. they didn't mention anything about numerical locks on the front door to the property i was placed in so i'm glad i didn't stay out too late and get locked out. just all around an unpleasant but liveable experience. very unorganized process and little to no explanation of things. would not recommend or stay here again."
Canada,Male,25-30,4.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,"the staff were nice enough i guess, but they moved us to another property riddled with problems. friend of mine even for a bad skin infection from the bed. would not recommend to anyone."
Sweden,Male,31-40,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0, a very pleasant place. with a very laidback staff and an welcoming atmosphere. definitely  good for the backpacker and a younger crowd. access to a nice swimming pool and a relative close distance to the metro that can take you in to downtown was a big plus. 
USA,Female,18-24,7.1,10.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,"you do get you money's worth here. $35 a night for decent sleeping quarters, walk in showers, they serve breakfast for you, they have a pool, and 10 minutes from train. the downsides were the atmosphere (guests and staff were somewhat reserved and doing their own thing; no events here) and the hostel is open door as in they don't lock the doors. even though it is in a college town, in a family neighborhood, and is claimed to be safe i would have felt more comfortable with it being more secure."
USA,Male,41+,8.0,10.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,6.0,"fun, fond memories of the old days of radio, an eclectic site, with parking the biggest difficulty.  for the money, it was fantastically good, at $ 22 a night"
SouthKorea,Male,18-24,8.0,10.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,6.0,staff members are kind and the laundry is for free.
Australia,Male,31-40,5.1,4.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,between hosteworld and anderson estates my booking was completely messed up   i got a email from anderson to let me know that even though i had a booking confirmation i was charged a shared room rate for a private room which is what i booked.. a private room. after many emails i was still not guaranteed the private room even though i was aled to pay a higher price which i was prepared to do. i also called them ten times with no answer. when i arrived there on the day there was no private room ac
Singapore,Male,31-40,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"clean, friendly staff, awesome pool.. if any extra, staff shares their staff meals with you too..thats a bonus! besides that, its evident they try to accomodate you to the best of their resources and capabilities.. to all visiting backpackers, wash your used dishes immediately please. it's counterproductive for the staff who cleans, when you leave dishes in the sink and you complain about roaches etc..  otherwise, all's fine and dandy..."
Australia,Male,18-24,8.0,10.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,"this hostel is perfect for  people who want to meet other travellers and hang out together, very communal atmosphere, everyone is very friendly.  if your are after more luxury / private accomodation this might not be for you, but if you want meet people have some drinks this is your place.  wifi is good in certain spots, very close to train station which takes you straight downtown. and the breakfast is amazing too.  had a great time here 😊. "
USA,Female,25-30,6.3,8.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,"definitely a solid place to stay. walk to the train wasn’t too long. pool wasn’t very clean (leaves and stuff), but it was also april so 🤷🏼‍♀️.  the dog in the lobby was the best part. she was perfect.  the kitchen was really small in the place i stayed. there was only 1 bathroom for like 15 people.  overall, i probably wouldn’t stay here again but i enjoyed it fine while there. "
Mexico,Male,25-30,8.3,10.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,"the best: free breakfast and laundry service, you can swim in the pool, the staff is friendly.    the worst: security, someone stole my personal towel. i know: it's just a towel but could had been a jewel or anything else..."
USA,Male,31-40,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,i had a nice peaceful stay would definitely go back
Ireland,Female,18-24,8.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,the hostel's in a lovely area very close to the metro line. breakfast every morning was yum! and it has a savage pool ... and lots of great staff (hadi 
Argentina,Male,25-30,7.7,8.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"they claim about a gap between their system and hostelworld. i booked a 4 bed room, the first night i get a bed at a 10 bed room, and the remaining nights at a 6 bed room. it is not critical, but if you booked something you expect that in return.    the neighborhood it is not the best, but it is okay.     pros:   -breakfast  -pool  -employees really friendly  "
Argentina,Female,18-24,4.9,4.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,"they don't have any key for the entrance of the property (any person can get into and nobody will ask anything).no lockers anywhere. to get in/out  the common areas you have to cross the room of 6 people (poor them, no privacy at all!). my 1st day they took all my luggage while i wasn't in the building for ""maintenance"" and left in the office. and they charged me $15 more for ""maintenance""  although everything was included in the price. although hostelworld don't mention it, they took it anyways"
USA,Male,41+,7.7,10.0,4.0,6.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"i prefer not to have bulldogs roaming the premises.  i also found one guest to be particularly invasive of my sense of well-being.  (a little too much like the bulldogs.)  the poolhouse based manager was consistently considerate and softspoken in a way that very much served the interest of a customer-facing organization.  i had my own set of planned (and unplanned) events, so i did not network with guests.  good, but be discerning, have a backup plan to avoid 'reality show' nightmare."
USA,Male,41+,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,i was asked to wake up while sleeping and get out of my bed while the room was searched. then i was asked to empty my pockets.   how humiliating
France,Male,25-30,9.7,10.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"this hostel is great. the rooms are nice, the people are nice, the complimentary breakfast is great.  there is a big swim pool. you just can't ask for more than that.      very clean too.     i put 5/5 for security, despite the regretable lack of lockers ( i never understood why some dorm doesn't have lockers. aren't they quite easy and cheap to build from square bookcase + adding little doors and lock ? ) , because it feels extremely safe here.       highly recommand. "
USA,Female,41+,8.3,10.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,6.0,the bathrooms and showers specifically need a good bleaching to get rid of moldy residues. that was pretty gross. was a bit intrusive with people walking through rooms at all hours of the night  when people are trying to sleep. there should be hours when these doors are locked to prevent this from occurring. from 2300-0600 would be good times to enforce this. 
USA,Male,25-30,5.7,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,"in all honesty, i met some truly unworthy people here. while the hostel was okay, i still felt uncomfortable at many moments. the staff weren't but really tentative to the needs of the guests and many times new guests would come to me seeking help with things that the staff should've been taking care of. i would like to say thanks to george, beatrice, mr. tony, barbara, abel and jesus for their great service and friendship during kyng stay! they took the time to actually speak and acknowledge us"
NewZealand,Male,18-24,9.1,10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,"the anderson estates provides value for money. for $25 per night i was able to get a free breakfast, free lunch, and access to an outdoor pool. the staff are friendly and nice and the place is tidy."
Australia,Female,25-30,6.9,8.0,2.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,our ensweet was the only one working for around 20 ppl. they were walking through our room at all hours. some didn't even knock. the breakfast was yummy and staff were nice. 
Australia,MixedGroup,18-24,6.6,8.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,"breakfast was absolutely amazing!! more of a halfway house rather than for travellers. other than that, truly enjoyed it!"
India,Male,18-24,4.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"the images shown here were't even close to reality. we were made to stay in a cottage outside the main mansion. we were assigned an 8 bed room although we had booked a 4 bed room. the reason given to us was that the hostel was overbooked since they do not have any way to limit the number of bookings.place is old, not well maintained, and shady. hostel staff was inefficient and breakfast never started on time. someone was sleeping on the couch in our lounge on one night. no lockers. roms dnt lock"
Malaysia,Male,18-24,9.7,10.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"great place to stay, made a lot of new friends from all over the world. free breakfast and wifi, and water too whenever you want. also you get to live in a piece of history, and they have really friendly dogs. "
England,Couple,18-24,4.0,6.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,"we booked to stay for two weeks, however ended up leaving after three hours. we arrived and were taken to an office where no one seemed to be working, and they didn't seem too interested in checking us in. once we had paid we were told we wouldn't be staying in the mansion in a four bed room, but were taken to the 'overflow' house in an eight bed room. it felt dirty and the atmosphere was very uncomfortable. they said we will get a refund, i have chased them up after two weeks and nothing. "
Australia,Couple,25-30,4.9,6.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,"this hostel has the potential to be beautiful, but our experience was definitely far from this. the room smelt unpleasant and was not clean. there was mould on the bathroom floor and it was never cleaned during the day. the rooms smelt of weed and had no security, lockers or anything of the sort. the security was the worst part and we felt uncomfortable leaving our possessions there during the day. the inside of the manor is quite nice. the staff were not very professional or helpful. "
USA,Female,18-24,2.3,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"the pictures from this place are very deceiving. when we pulled up to the location, the mansion looked very sketchy and torn-down. the facility was not kept in maintenance. we had to go through the mansion (when i say mansion, just picture a huge house with paint chipping off and creepy people staring at your from their window), to get to the office space. the staff in the office also seemed very sketchy &amp; super weird. we had to go through another room to get to our room which seemed really off."
Italy,Male,31-40,8.0,10.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"felt my belongings were safe, but there are no lockers in the rooms.  metro stop is close-by. staff is cool and keen to help.  bad points:   - difference between hostelworld booking system and on site room allocation (never happened before)  - one of the rooms is kind of a preferred passage by guests of other rooms, and some of the guests used to leave the room door open while smoking next to it    likely to come back - a few improvements (see above) would make this place a ""must go""."
Belgium,Male,31-40,8.6,8.0,6.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,8.0,8.0,"great atmosphere, i like the location and i have extended my stay."

England,Female,18-24,4.6,4.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,this is false advertisement. there are no private rooms for 4 people available and the staff stated that this was hostel worlds fault not theirs (doubt it). the place was filthy. the staff were not helpful unless you spoke to mr.anderson.  there was no locks! it was close to the public transport but not worth it! i would not recommend this place at all!!

Germany,Female,18-24,6.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,there was a communication problem since we had booked a private room and were expecting privacy since we thought we paid more than we would have for a shared room. in the end we got a room for two nights which we were able to lock but it took a while. then we had to move into another room. the bathroom that came with that room had not been cleaned and there were used toiletries and towels in there. please check with the owner which rooms are available and whether the they match the offer on hw.c

Canada,Male,18-24,4.9,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,"anderson estates is not a hostel in the typical sense. there is the main mansion where the pool/yard is located. as well, mr. anderson owns several houses in the area where bunk beds have been set up. some of the beds are set up in bedrooms, but bunk beds are also set up in open areas with zero privacy.    there is absolutely zero security! the house and bedroom could not be locked, and there were no storage lockers for your items. considering the sketchy neighborhood, this is very worrying."

USA,Female,31-40,6.6,8.0,6.0,4.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,4.0,not bad for the price. has a pool &amp; the people are friendly. but people need to learn to knock on your door not just bust in on you. not the best location for site seeing. most of the time you&amp;#39;ll need to call a cab or use uber/lyft. but overall it was a good experience. i&amp;#39;d stay again.  bostonbyrd

Argentina,Male,31-40,6.6,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,"nice place, but is not a mansion, the rooms are in a little house near to the swimming pool. the staff was volunteers from france very bad face, the breakfast is bad food, the only good is wafles but only 1 for person.   the please doesnt have lockers, and everybody pass for your room.  the doors doesnt have lock.  also the staff put the tv in the night too high.    the neighbourhood is nice and you have the metro close.

USA,AllMaleGroup,18-24,9.4,10.0,8.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,the people were awesome and so was the breakfast! it&amp;#39;s hard to tell who&amp;#39;s on the staff and who isn&amp;#39;t but if you ask around you can always get help from a friendly staff member. if you get drunk with the french people you&amp;#39;ll probably end up getting thrown into the pool... all in good fun! this place was great!
Australia,Female,31-40,6.6,8.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,"bit of a strange vibe, and it's very much in the suburbs. close to train line though and the neighbourhood is alright. facilities made available to dorm customers are pretty average - i kind of felt like i was intruding tbh, though people were all nice, it's less travellers and more people in between houses or moving to la that seem to stay in the dorms. nice looking pool, comfy beds and everything cleaned daily, can't comment on the breakfast because i'm vegan but people seemed to enjoy it."
USA,MixedGroup,41+,2.9,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,the place looked dark and uninviting.  as we walked the facility we felt unsafe and concerned about how easy it was for people to come in and out of the property.      we expected to see travelers like ourselfs but instead we saw a lot of young people just hanging around and it looked like they had been living there for a while.  the place looked like a college dorm after a house party.      we want our deposit back because what was been advertised is not what we witnessed.      
Netherlands,Male,18-24,6.9,8.0,2.0,6.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"the anderson estates hostel is a beautiful place to visit.     when i arrived i wasnt enable to check in, but some employees (there are volunteers from workaway) did help me to get a bed. everybody was telling me that the breakfast is good, but im used to do a dutch breakfast.. so it wasnt good for me. it is very sweet and i didnt like the way they serve breakfast. the location is good, like everything in the us... you have to travel a long distance. after all its a good and &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; hostel.
